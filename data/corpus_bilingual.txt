PREFACE.
[Illustration]
_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as
to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet
unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger
Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly
theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might
very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and
others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and
Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them._
_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present
book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss
Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the
more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the
Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,
I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It
seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention
in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show
cause._
_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this
combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost
regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident
could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia
and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de
théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.
Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the
same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the
hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think
the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen
always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given
by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare
say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would
certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
avail himself, appear at once on the stage._
_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts
and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite
consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built
novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the
ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one
should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her
faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John
Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,
but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
superior to them._
_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate
that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
express, and at any particular time likely to be differently
apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a
greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of
the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of
scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in
Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of
common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a
certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those
who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the
savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness
of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much
protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a
restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,
of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early
nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,
would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the
innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
at blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel
of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected
Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been
written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the
days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I
think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s
own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the
English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous
falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means
the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells
beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then
every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a
fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is
a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even
have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she
took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,
and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she
was immensely the better for it as an artist._
_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed
that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,
combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that
we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature
painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the
term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling
at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than
of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should
myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a
microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the
littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to
paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not
feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very
short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not
much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a
single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her
composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly
anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century
seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott
required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and
German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an
English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when
ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might
pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the
gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were
subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which
Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular
taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost
touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey
even in a black one._
_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the
first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are
true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she
has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes
the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any
Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously
piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get
none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can
shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the
myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book
only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.
Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have
stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_
himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the
breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with
just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I
should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her
to Addison in others._
_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears
nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.
Collins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison
ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has
been said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he
_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and
distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,
to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at
the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we
possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first
draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The
formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.
Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the
“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain
side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century
humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech
or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions
are historically true._
_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily
exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
figures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like
Mr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,
perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me
very faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible
to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble
birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
as Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady
Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of
developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
themselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even
Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him
for the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must
always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her
or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but
the ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,
except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of
the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that
even Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is
difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,
or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of
the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,
do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.
Let us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry
to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just
related as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these
pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the
result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s
readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by
the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as
they are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction
outside of these four._
_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been
already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties
difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have
glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely
amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and
Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have
differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
weaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has
taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;
not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting
traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming
her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of
first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and
singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but
perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings
in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not
to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and
respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.
Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish
that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite
these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe
poor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._
_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de
Bourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,
further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though
delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between
comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
that Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in
dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in
drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet
not disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with
a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the
hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._
_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of
Miss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,
whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is
unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I
cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which
his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its
sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s
scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in
even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he
been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting
under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the
probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in
love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
charm._
_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen
herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather
to be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_
allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was
always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and
except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate
sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing
about her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the
lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost
strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and
secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give
at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest
obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early
speeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to
serious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,
as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the
final ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then
too she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself
or anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with
as personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of
this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same
kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
who ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the
injury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family
aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._
_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her
playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a
certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.
Nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent
Darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the
idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.
Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the
“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)
women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea
that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with
her if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”
she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of
passion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so
invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of
these qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.
But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have
married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and
anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’
conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked
to the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della
Cruscans of this._
_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of
charm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic
exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In
the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young
ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at
least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can
help doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth
Bennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara
Grant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I
should, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana
and Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one
of the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._

Chapter I.]
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?”
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.
“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
[Illustration:
“He came down to see the place”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
This was invitation enough.
“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week.”
“What is his name?”
“Bingley.”
“Is he married or single?”
“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
“How so? how can it affect them?”
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
“Is that his design in settling here?”
“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.”
“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
party.”
“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.”
“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new
comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not.”
“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”
“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”
“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take
delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”
“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least.”
“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”
“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”
“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.”
“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.”
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.

CHAPTER II.
[Illustration]
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,--
“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”
“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”
“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her.”
“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.”
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
them ill.”
“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When
is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”
“To-morrow fortnight.”
“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till
the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
she will not know him herself.”
“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_.”
“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”
“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I
will take it on myself.”
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
nonsense!”
“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books, and make extracts.”
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
Bingley.”
“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.
“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.
“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.”
“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was
shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.”
“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I’m the tallest.”
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.

CHAPTER III.
[Illustration]
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.
“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his

     “When the Party entered”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a
report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a
number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,
his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the
assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
friend.
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
friend to join it.
“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.”
“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.”
“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
uncommonly pretty.”
“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
[Illustration:
“She is tolerable”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,
“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a
book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.
“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”
“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of
his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”
“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never
in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the
lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”
[Illustration]
CHAPTER IV.
[Illustration]
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.
“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!”
“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”
“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment.”
“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person.”
“Dear Lizzy!”
“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”
“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.”
“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the
good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”
“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.”
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine
ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an
hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In
understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually
giving offence.
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
much.
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.
[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER V.
[Illustration]
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The
distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;
and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about
a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,
friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him
courteous.
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth’s intimate friend.
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil
self-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”
“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”
“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.”
“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”
“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”
“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”
[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”
“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being
spoke to.”
“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.”
“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come
to the ball in a hack chaise.”
“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
wish he had danced with Eliza.”
“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you.”
“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”
“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.”
“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his
sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”
“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly.”
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would; and the argument ended only with the visit.
[Illustration]
[Illustration]
CHAPTER VI.
[Illustration]
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the
two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It
was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss
Lucas.
“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too.”
“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”
“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal
it, he must find it out.”
“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chooses.”
“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.”
“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.”
“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.”
“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.
He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were
assembled.
“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?”
“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”
[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George
Allen._]]
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,--
“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?”
“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic.”
“You are severe on us.”
“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”
“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,
she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is
of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and
I shall keep mine to swell my song.”
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--
“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is
nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies.”
“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”
Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”
“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”
“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James’s?”
“Never, sir.”
“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”
“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”
“You have a house in town, I conclude?”
Mr. Darcy bowed.
“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.”
He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,--
“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--
“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour.”
“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?”
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--
“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
“I should imagine not.”
“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of
your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the
noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”
“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you
joy?”
“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”
“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”
He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed along.

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER VII.
[Illustration]
Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was
the head-quarters.
Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed,--
“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.”
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.
“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”
“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”
“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.”
“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in
his regimentals.”
“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--
“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
     /* NIND “My dear friend, */
     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never
     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
     Yours ever,
“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”
“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.”
“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”
“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.
“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.”
“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.”
“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”
“I had much rather go in the coach.”
“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”
[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]
“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”
“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
will be answered.”
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.
“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:--
     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */
     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a
     headache, there is not much the matter with me.
“Yours, etc.”
“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”
“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little
trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays
there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the
carriage.”
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was
her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.”
“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”
“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
horses?”
“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”
“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.
“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”
In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.
She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was
good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.

CHAPTER VIII.
[Illustration]
At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst
thought the same, and added,--
“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild.”
“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”
“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.”
“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well
when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.”
“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition.”
“Certainly not.”
“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.”
“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
Bingley.
“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.”
“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--
“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet
girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it.”
“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton?”
“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”
“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.
“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.”
“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend’s vulgar relations.
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”
“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I
am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”
“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.
“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.”
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.
“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”
“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many
generations.”
“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying
books.”
“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.”
“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.”
“I wish it may.”
“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.”
“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”
“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”
“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.
“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will
she be as tall as I am?”
“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or
rather taller.”
“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”
“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am
sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
being informed that she was very accomplished.”
“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished.”
“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.
“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.”
“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”
“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved.”
“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add
something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
reading.”
“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”
“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?”
“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.
“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it
succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”
“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.”
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

CHAPTER IX.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.”
“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.”
“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.”
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
hope, though you have but a short lease.”
“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”
“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.
“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”
“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”
“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”
“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were
a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”
“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage.”
“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.”
“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.”
“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.”
Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph,--
“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”
“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”
“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.”
“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true.”
“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.
“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”
“Did Charlotte dine with you?”
“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I
assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”
“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.
“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”
“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.
“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,
indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her
own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was
very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the
ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer
to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.
“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”
Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she
added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.

CHAPTER X.
[Illustration]
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.
“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”
He made no answer.
“You write uncommonly fast.”
“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”
“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”
“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”
“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”
“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”
“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.”
“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”
“How can you contrive to write so even?”
He was silent.
“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley’s.”
“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.”
“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”
“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine.”
“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill.”
“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much
for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”
“My style of writing is very different from yours.”
“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”
“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.”
“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”
“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”
“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”
“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”
“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.”
“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a
circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.”
“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for
himself.”
“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.”
“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.”
“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.”
“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?”
“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.”
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.
“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.”
“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”
“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.”
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the
way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,
at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her,--
“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.
“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
dare.”
“Indeed I do not dare.”
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.”
[Illustration:
     “No, no; stay where you are”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”
“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.
“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.
“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without
telling us that you were coming out.”
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said,--
“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.”
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,--
“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye.”
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
[Illustration:
     “Piling up the fire”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER XI.
[Illustration]
When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers
of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment
with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
acquaintance with spirit.
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the
door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.
When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss
Bennet.
Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.”
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,--
“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.”
“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send
round my cards.”
“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day.”
“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be
near so much like a ball.”
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the
desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
turning to Elizabeth, said,--
“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.”
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.
“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
nothing about it.”
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.
“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be
completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.”
“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”
“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”
“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,
no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.
Darcy may hug himself.”
“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a
laugh.”
“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The
wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may
be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke.”
“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without.”
“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.”
“Such as vanity and pride.”
“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;
“and pray what is the result?”
“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.”
“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for
ever.”
“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”
“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”
“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”
“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand
them.”
“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst.”
Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XII.
[Illustration]
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He
wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.

CHAPTER XIII
[Illustration]
“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”
“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”
Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly
thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.
But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got
to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this
moment.”
“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.”
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a
fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,
and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,
when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
pleases.”
“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.”
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.”
“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?”
“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.”
     /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */
“Dear Sir,
     “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,
     fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be
     on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
     at variance.”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--“My mind, however, is now
     made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,
     I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
     the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis
     de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
     valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
     endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
     Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
     which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
     moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
     of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
     these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of
     good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
     being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly
     overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
     olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
     means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
     apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
     them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should
     have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself
     the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,
     November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your
     hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do
     without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting
     to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other
     clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,
     with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
     well-wisher and friend,
“WILLIAM COLLINS.”
“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.”
“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.”
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.
“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There
is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by
apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would
help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”
“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”
“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.”
To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--
“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.”
“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,
I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.”
“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted----”
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured
him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged
pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a
quarter of an hour.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XIV
[Illustration]
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.
“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”
“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”
“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”
“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.”
“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”
“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”
“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.”
“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.”
“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?”
“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.”
Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,
glad to invite him
[Illustration:
“Protested
that he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94
]
to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be
from a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,
protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia
exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he
chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,--
“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away
Richard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--
“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”
Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.
Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XV.
[Illustration]
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to
hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.
Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes
were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very
Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and
he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all
wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible
to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same
spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in
their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was
greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.
What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.
Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s
commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham
appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Philips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XVI.
[Illustration]
As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
the house.
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper’s room.
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
[Illustration:
“The officers of the ----shire”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin.
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,
in return, by sitting down to whist.
“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to
improve myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very
thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,
though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,
the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even
mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.”
“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”
“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable.”
“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”
“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short
interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”
“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.”
Wickham only shook his head.
“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.”
“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.”
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.
“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.”
“Indeed!”
“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.”
“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”
“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me.”
“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.
“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.”
“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!”
After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful.”
“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can
hardly be just to him.”
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself
with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner.”
“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,
appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use
to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;
and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it
to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”
“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it.”
“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be
traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.”
“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his
father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.”
“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”
He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very
proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education.”
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--
“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
know Mr. Bingley?”
“Not at all.”
“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.”
“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure.”
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.
“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.”
Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations
were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.
“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a
living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”
“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”
“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.”
“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.
“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her
Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have
not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class.”
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.

CHAPTER XVII.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.
“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.”
“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.”
“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a
manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? Oh no.”
“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that
Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last
night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not
so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”
“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think.”
“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when
the affair became public.
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.
“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.”
Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,
either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.
“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;
for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement
of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on
Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday
endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XVIII.
[Illustration]
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s
pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,--
“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she
had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary
transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of
distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and
solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her
release from him was ecstasy.
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind: Charlotte tried to console her.
“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.”
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at
first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it
would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,
she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,
with--
“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the
dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
room, or the number of couples.”
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.
“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but
_now_ we may be silent.”
“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.”
“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”
“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”
said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”
“I must not decide on my own performance.”
He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.”
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,--
“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain.”
“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,
with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.”
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.
“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing
at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will
then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.
You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
[Illustration:
“Such very superior dancing is not
often seen.”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,--
“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking
of.”
“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,
and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”
“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.
“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.”
“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”
“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.”
“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
with a look of doubt.
“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_?”
“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.
“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
“I hope not.”
“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.”
“May I ask to what these questions tend?”
“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”
“And what is your success?”
She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”
“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.”
“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,
with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--
“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?
Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his
other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.
Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using
him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always
remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a
most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very
well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear
to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he
could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.
His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and
I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this
discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his
descent, one could not expect much better.”
“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”
said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing
worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.”
“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”
“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.
“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.”
“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his
sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s
regard.”
“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”
“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”
“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”
“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.”
“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,
“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before.”
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate
as to make a most important discovery.
“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,
Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”
“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with
the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
speaking, replied thus,--
“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the
dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform
what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education
and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”
“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with
unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,
replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that
very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly
saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,
she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within
one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was
talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.
Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable
of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such
a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a
comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be
certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It
was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to
consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might
not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary
to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such
occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”
“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing.”
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.
At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.
She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--
“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I
cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who
should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody
connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded
his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.
Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for
having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady
Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the
room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent
to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend
himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining
close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a
project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who
often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation
to herself.
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an
hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,
how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful
pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.

CHAPTER XIX.
[Illustration]
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--
“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?”
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet instantly answered,--
“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure
she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,--
“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
going away myself.”
“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And
upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr. Collins.”
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--
“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued,--
“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to
have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them.”
“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have
just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.”
“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,
very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications.”
“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus
addressed her,--
“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.”
“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one.”
“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer
would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my
connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your
own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into
further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is
by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,
therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart.”
“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.”
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

CHAPTER XX.
[Illustration]
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.
“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is
a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it.”
“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out, as she entered the library,--
“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will
not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_.”
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by
her communication.
“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”
“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”
“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”
“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.”
“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.
“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”
Elizabeth replied that it was.
“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
“I have, sir.”
“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”
“Yes, or I will never see her again.”
“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_.”
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”
“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.”
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”
[Illustration:
     “they entered the breakfast room”
]
Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her
family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;
“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.”
Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as
may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she
can have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--
“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
conversation:--
“Oh, Mr. Collins!”
“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I
trust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXI.
[Illustration]
The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to
her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.
“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”
She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.
His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
[Illustration: “Walked back with them”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to
join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they
had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is
from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way
to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear
what she says.”
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to
regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these
high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.
“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.”
“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.
“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I
despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
whom we shall deprive you.’
“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this
winter.”
“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”
“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.
But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is
impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely
less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has
her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still
more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to
you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country
without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said
Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly
declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that
if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most
kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the
subject?”
“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”
“Most willingly.”
“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.”
Jane shook her head.
“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my
dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”
“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself.”
“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”
“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?”
“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,
by all means, to refuse him.”
“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.”
“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.”
“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s
interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.
She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of
thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at
Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take
care to have two full courses.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXII.
[Illustration]
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good
humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His
reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever
[Illustration:
     “So much love and eloquence”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and
Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins
should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly
expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.
James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the
occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two
sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte
herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time
to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.
Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was
irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would
be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,
marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable
provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however
uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative
from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of
twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good
luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she
valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and
probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of
the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies
moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and
cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,
whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.
“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.”
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,--
“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.”
“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”
“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”
“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth.”
With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility
as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out,--
“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied,--
“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the
prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she
wished her all imaginable happiness.
“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,
very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.”
Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.
[Illustration:
     “Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER XXIII.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--
“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.
Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After
discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,
with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the
affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained
that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had
been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;
for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would
be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early
day for making him the happiest of men.
Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued
absence.
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all
Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
[Illustration:
     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”
]
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced
to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”
“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.
“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it.”
“What should not you mind?”
“I should not mind anything at all.”
“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.”
“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own
daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!
Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”
“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXIV.
[Illustration]
Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s
assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had
really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;
whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had
escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of
him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s
situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,--
“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I
will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.”
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.
“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no
reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and
nothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little
time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”
With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.”
“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.”
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister’s warm affection.
“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,
the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it
is unaccountable!”
“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and
Charlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.”
“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.”
“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.”
“And men take care that they should.”
“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”
said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.”
“And do you impute it to either of those?”
“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I
think of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”
“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can
secure it.”
“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.”
“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;
“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to
part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best
comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one
day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next
to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and
then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”
“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane’s good fortune.”
“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will
always make the most of it.”
Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXV.
[Illustration]
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to
hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two
eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.
“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves.”
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I
am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,
such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty
girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily
forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”
[Illustration:
     “Offended two or three young ladies”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.”
“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_
Mr. Bingley’s love?”
“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”
“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would
be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.”
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister’s ready acquiescence.
“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.”
“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,
perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.”
“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”
“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
But, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s
attractions.
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
hoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she
might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.
The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been
in the way of procuring.
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible
subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with
the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the
present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might
agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having
heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
ill-natured boy.
[Illustration:
     “Will you come and see me?”
]
CHAPTER XXVI.
[Illustration]
Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--
“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”
“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.”
“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are
seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that
it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is
not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his
first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In
short, I will do my best.”
“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”
“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you
are satisfied.”
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented.
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the
Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His
marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the
wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and
when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,
Charlotte said,--
“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”
“_That_ you certainly shall.”
“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”
“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”
“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.”
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.
“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and
I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them.”
The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.
“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
soon see them here.”
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself
no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
will prove what she felt:--
     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she
     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she
     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so
     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I
     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all
     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot
     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be
     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear
     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.
“Yours, etc.”
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every
review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
plain.”

CHAPTER XXVII.
[Illustration]
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the
plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater
pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire
of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.
There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give
her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as
perfect as plan could be.
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when
they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to
hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.
“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.”
“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.”
“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”
“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death
made her mistress of this fortune?”
“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?”
“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
soon after this event.”
“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?”
“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”
“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”
“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”
“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.”
“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.
Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear
aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me
fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men
to rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”

CHAPTER XXVIII.
[Illustration]
Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:
his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were
in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
offers of refreshment.
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though
everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.
Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire
every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the
fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a
handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed,--
“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”
“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added
Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”
“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse
with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,--
[Illustration:
     “In Conversation with the ladies”
[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]
“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment.”
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;
and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.
“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter!”
“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady
Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The
other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”
“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?”
“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in.”
“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife.”
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that
way.
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.
[Illustration:
     ‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER XXIX.
[Illustration]
Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady
Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.
“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine
there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so
immediately after your arrival?”
“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,
“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to
Elizabeth,--
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.”
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. James’s.
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment
increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
thought she could witness without trepidation.
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.
In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as
marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;
and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who
was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a
manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady
Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most
gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty
to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready
to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between
Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how
little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and
fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,
and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an
occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,--
“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your
sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?”
“A little.”
“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”
“One of them does.”
“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?”
“No, not at all.”
“What, none of you?”
“Not one.”
“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”
“Has your governess left you?”
“We never had any governess.”
“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.”
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.
“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must
have been neglected.”
“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle certainly might.”
“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady
Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”
“Yes, ma’am, all.”
“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must
be very young?”
“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”
“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age.”
“I am not one-and-twenty.”
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s
praise into his own hands.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXX.
[Illustration]
Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in
reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.
Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.
[Illustration:
     “he never failed to inform them”
]
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.
In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have
[Illustration:
“The gentlemen accompanied him.”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage
turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the
following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were
two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought
with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;
and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,
the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her
husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the
other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--
“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.”
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
courtesied to him, without saying a word.
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--
“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?”
She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.
[Illustration:
“At Church”
]
CHAPTER XXXI.
[Illustration]
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had
only seen at church.
The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,
moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,--
“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”
“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.
“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true
enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever
learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her
health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have
performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady
Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal.”
“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly.”
“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will
never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part
of the house.”
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made
no answer.
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--
“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me.”
“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,
are not your own.”
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”
“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”
“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The
first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at
a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four
dances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four
dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,
you cannot deny the fact.”
“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.”
“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”
“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”
“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?”
“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”
“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,
“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.”
“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take
the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers
as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”
Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,--
“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was
ready to take them all home.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXXII.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.
Darcy only, entered the room.
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.
They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,--
“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”
“Perfectly so, I thank you.”
She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short
pause, added,--
“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?”
“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.”
“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle.”
“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.
He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.”
“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”
“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”
“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”
“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.”
“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”
“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s
journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”
“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family.”
“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--
“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance.”
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn.”
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--
“Are you pleased with Kent?”
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_
surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his
intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,
without saying much to anybody, went away.
[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called on us in this familiar way.”
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former
favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there
was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she
believed he might have the best informed mind.
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
[Illustration]
More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her
pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her
a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.
She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,
she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.
Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--
“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally
do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.
Are you going much farther?”
“No, I should have turned in a moment.”
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.
“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.”
“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”
“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.”
“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”
“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry
where they like.”
“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.”
“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.”
“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is
the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,--
“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.”
“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”
“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does
your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes
a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.”
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--
“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”
“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike
man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”
“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”
“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me
in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted
to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose
that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”
“What is it you mean?”
“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it
would be an unpleasant thing.”
“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”
“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”
“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.”
“And what arts did he use to separate them?”
“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He
only told me what I have now told you.”
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.
“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your
cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the
judge?”
“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”
she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.”
“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.
“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.
“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could
anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought
of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXXIV.
[Illustration]
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.
She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his
cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:--
“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.”
Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately
followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a
degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of
all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a
favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks
and she said,--
“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.”
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings
dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--
“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”
“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?”
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued,--
“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.”
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself.”
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”
“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him?”
“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his
misfortunes have been great indeed.”
“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have
reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You
have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed
for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that
independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done
all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with
contempt and ridicule.”
“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my
being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--
“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.”
She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--
“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it.”
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--
“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”
“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.”
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of
her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,
and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her
astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by
every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from
Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which
must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost
incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong
an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal
of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in
acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner
which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not
attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his
attachment had for a moment excited.
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.
[Illustration:
“Hearing herself called”
]
CHAPTER XXXV.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her
walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove
which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being
Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was
now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,
though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again
towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty
composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of
meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and
then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon
out of sight.
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those
offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.
“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due
to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must
be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in
Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley
preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But
it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any
apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him
in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with
you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental
information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to
a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain
event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I
observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive
that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed
in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,
cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that
though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite
them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken
here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your
sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled
by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most
acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing
her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my
investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I
believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.
My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night
acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes
which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both
instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not
immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The
situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and
occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend
you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,
and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on
you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and
disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed
that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my
friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left
Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,
remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is
now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited
with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly
went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my
friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them
earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed
his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have
prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before
believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,
that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade
him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for
having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole
affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I
condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss
Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might
have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some
danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is
done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have
nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your
sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not
yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty
accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by
laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he
has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I
shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in
the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service
to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and
afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,
always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this
young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the
highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years
since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The
vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to
guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the
observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who
had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy
could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you
only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has
created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding
his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father
died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the
last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to
promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living
might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of
one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and
within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me
that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should
not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I
must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be
sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The
business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he
chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being
now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and
dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the
decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His
circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,
were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present
him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little
doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,
and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will
hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to
the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in
his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this
period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I
know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my
notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me
to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of
your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and
myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with
the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior
acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were
most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far
recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was
persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She
was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended
elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving
and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I
acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public
exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,
and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s
chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty
thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been
complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in
which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of
falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning
either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not
told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know
what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here
related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel
Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been
unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If
your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you
cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour
to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.
“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXXVI.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the
real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any
wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done
which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all
pride and insolence.
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to
the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told
[Illustration:
     “Meeting accidentally in Town”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,
she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and
manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished
trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone
for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what
Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’
continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him
instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could
remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the
neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once
more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his
designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed
between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at
last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel
Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the
information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose
character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost
resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness
of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that
Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been
well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His
attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his
actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.
“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on
my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not
have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were
concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”
From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious
of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what
Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice
of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though
fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant
complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but
it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and
reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so
important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at
length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
must make her unfit for conversation.
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object. She could think only of her letter.
[Illustration:
“His parting obeisance”
]
CHAPTER XXXVII.
[Illustration]
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
Ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how
would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused
herself.
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!
They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear
Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”
Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--
“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.”
“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday.”
“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.”
“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”
[Illustration:
“Dawson”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will
stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you
as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and
as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good
room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be
cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
large.”
“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.”
Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the
world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.
Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am
glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”
“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”
“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to.”
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was
necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a
mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection
must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave
way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a
solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of
unpleasant recollections.
Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.
Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to
have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out
her hand to both.
[Illustration:
“The elevation of his feelings.”
]
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
[Illustration]
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know
how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
your time unpleasantly.”
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel
the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,--
“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on
what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In
truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this
humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.
“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.”
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such
society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for
compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,
and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed
her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.
[Illustration:
“They had forgotten to leave any message”
]
“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.”
Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.
“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!”
“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.
“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!”
Elizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s
house, where they were to remain a few days.
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
further.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
[Illustration]
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”
“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing
her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.”
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.”
“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!”
“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”
“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to
table. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like.”
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--
“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”
“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”
“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.
“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?”
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and
Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.
“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would
_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,----
“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the
table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet
was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.
“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought
we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”
To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was
another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham
again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to
_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XL.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.
Darcy and herself.
Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment.”
“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
“Blame you! Oh, no.”
“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day.”
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.
“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.
Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,
only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and
with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a
thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must
feel it so.”
“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing
every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me
saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as
light as a feather.”
“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”
“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.”
“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.”
“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.”
“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very
uncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,
and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”
“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.”
“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is
one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham’s character.”
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”
“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to
make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is
so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to
it. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to
anybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found
out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
At present I will say nothing about it.”
“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”
The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She
had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a
fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she
might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something
lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not
relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister
how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in
which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than
a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in
throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if
that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be
able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner
himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost
all its value!”
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.
“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I
cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.”
[Illustration:
     “I am determined never to speak of it again”
]
“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”
“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was
her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done.”
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she
made no answer.
“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say.”
“No, nothing at all.”
“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”
“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”
“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”
[Illustration:
“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER XLI.
[Illustration]
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.
“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?”
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.
“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”
“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.
“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”
“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”
“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”
added Kitty.
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.
But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”
said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--
“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.”
“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and
imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.”
“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”
“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?”
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,
affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.”
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.
[Illustration:
“Tenderly flirting”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there
himself.
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving
home.
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.
On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,
with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s
recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you
say that he was at Rosings?”
“Nearly three weeks.”
“And you saw him frequently?”
“Yes, almost every day.”
“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”
“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”
“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray
may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in
address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his
ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more
serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”
“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was.”
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,--
“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,
from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”
Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,--
“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is
merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart.”
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

Gardiners

CHAPTER XLII.
[Illustration]
Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked
forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the
camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less
to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,
good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything
wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter
came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle
of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton
without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth
hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably
reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by
some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment
should be quartered in Meryton.
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It
was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.”
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country.”
Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
[Illustration:
     “Conjecturing as to the date”
]
CHAPTER XLIII.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.
The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties
to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture
suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with
admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly
fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the
furniture of Rosings.
“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting
herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds
replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large
party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had
not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other
miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how
she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the
picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who
had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the
army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.
“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.”
“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.”
Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.
“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”
Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”
“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”
“Yes, very handsome.”
“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of them.”
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.
“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.
“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she
comes here to-morrow with him.”
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.
“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”
“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”
“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”
“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him.”
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”
“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows
him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four years old.”
This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was
grateful to her uncle for saying,--
“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master.”
“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not
meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world.”
Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.
“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.”
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men.”
“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.
“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
“Perhaps we might be deceived.”
“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when
last at Pemberley.
“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter
the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her.”
The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father’s lifetime.
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good
or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by
the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before
the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon
herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude
than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened
its impropriety of expression.
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.
They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.
She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and
vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her
family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to
account for it.
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that
he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,
she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not
got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky
recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from
her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said
no more.
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought
she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of
fashion.”
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some
relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From
what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love
me.”
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in
Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They
will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.
“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a
pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?”
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with
great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.
On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into
the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they
parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it.”
“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”
“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are
perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?”
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.
“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds.”
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.
“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends
every virtue.”
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XLIV.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.
They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and
looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom
she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be
pleased.
[Illustration:
     “To make herself agreeable to all”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a
like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No
look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing
occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On
this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances
occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted
a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He
observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and
in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long
time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could
reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the
26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but
whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her
that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,
however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one
day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the
good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would
have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,
but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected
their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the
change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could
hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the
company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.
Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and
on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be
overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,
where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such
a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as
such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no
means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,
she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.

CHAPTER XLV.
[Illustration]
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know
with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now
be renewed.
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she
feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--
“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”
In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with
that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.
Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,
Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s
person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her
brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment
could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave
Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and
amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help
repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I
never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again.”
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.
“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.”
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,--
“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_
a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.”
“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_
was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s
beginning the subject.

Chapter XLVI.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on
the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--
“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and
let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written.”
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham
and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated
to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,
intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but
no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a
hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.
All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the
London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible
inquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,
anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet
and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to
pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and
broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any
blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and
mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many
circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married
privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_
could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,
which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?
Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed
to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my
hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother
is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be
better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in
my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot
wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is
over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,
however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen
again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances
are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as
soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not
afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of
the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,
to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but
his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the
best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton
again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and
assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately
comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”
“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and
impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself
enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s
situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;
I have not an instant to lose.”
“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”
“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his
[Illustration:
     “I have not an instant to lose”
]
concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke
again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It
cannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her
friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.
Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too
well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that
can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”
Darcy was fixed in astonishment.
“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_
might have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained
some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had
his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,
all too late now.”
“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it
certain, absolutely certain?”
“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to
Scotland.”
“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”
“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power
was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--
“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything
to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,
that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment
you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the
pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”
“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”
He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with
only one serious parting look, went away.
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a
hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,
that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience
was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never
been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily
settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be
done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?”
“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled.”
“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”
But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.

CHAPTER XLVII.
[Illustration]
“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form
such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk.”
“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?”
“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not
hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
case?”
“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland.”
“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road.”
“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”
“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.”
“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”
“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which
are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every
charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”
“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”
“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with
such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.”
“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?”
“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts.”
“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could
find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort
to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long
expectations.
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from
her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.
“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well.”
“Is my father in town?”
“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”
“And have you heard from him often?”
“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention.”
“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”
“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven! are quite well.”
“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!”
Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of
the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.
“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear
child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do.”
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.”
“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from
fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear
Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,
for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how
kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more
of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--
“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one
false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I
have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”
“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”
“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”
“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”
“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”
“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other many weeks.”
“But not before they went to Brighton?”
“No, I believe not.”
“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he
know his real character?”
“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:
but I hope this may be false.”
“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!”
“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.
“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what
their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”
“We acted with the best intentions.”
“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his
wife?”
“He brought it with him for us to see.”
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:--
     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */
     “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for
     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to
     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed
     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
     drink to our good journey.
“Your affectionate friend,
“LYDIA BENNET.”
“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But
at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”
“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!”
“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.”
“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.”
“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of
repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on
Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady
Lucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us.”
“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”
She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be
remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.”

     The Post
]
CHAPTER XLVIII.
[Illustration]
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and
everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
effect:--
“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there
were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such
a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
other person.”
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father
and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,
however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to
give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting
it, the application was a something to look forward to.
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:--
     /* “My dear Sir, */
     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The
     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of
     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your
     [Illustration:
“To whom I have related the affair”
     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
     daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,
     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,
     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally
     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in
     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by
     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.
     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one
     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for
     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,
     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain
     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been
     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,
     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.
“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.
Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up
any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His
former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out
as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be
necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the
town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner
did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;
Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly
unexpected; I had not an idea of it.”
Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.
“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?”
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.”
“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.
“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.”
“Do you suppose them to be in London?”
“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.
“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.”
Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
tea.
“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”
“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”
“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner.”
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them.”
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XLIX.
[Illustration]
Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”
“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”
“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter.”
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,--
“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the
little copse.”
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--
“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”
“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”
“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”
“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is
about.”
     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */
“My dear Brother,
     “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after
     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.
     It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them
     both----”
     [Illustration:
“But perhaps you would like to read it”
     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
     “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!”
     Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,
     considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
     anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.
“EDW. GARDINER.”
“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be
possible that he will marry her?”
“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her
sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”
“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.
“No; but it must be done soon.”
Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.
“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”
“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble
yourself.”
“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.”
“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”
“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever
to pay him.”
“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.”
“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,
it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”
“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.”
“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?”
Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”
“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?”
“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said
Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!”
“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.”
“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
replied,--
“Just as you please.”
“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”
“Take whatever you like, and get away.”
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,
her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My
good, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.
“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money.”
“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.
“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s
situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she
had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,
neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly
expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only
two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER L.
[Illustration]
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to
be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her
husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within
that sum.
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have
as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in
its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was
indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery
was considered certain.
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.
“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s
frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she
could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to
a couple who were only brought together because their passions were
stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.
“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his
marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the
Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is
an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have
pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and
all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--Yours, etc.
“E. GARDINER.”
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s
removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But
Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in
the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.
“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s
regiment.”
His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.

“With an affectionate smile”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER LI.
[Illustration]
Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet
them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival
was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who
gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.
Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was
Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned
from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of
some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a
great while since she had been there.
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners
were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth
had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the
impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the
cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
colour.
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.
“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:
it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.”
Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--
“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was
afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,
so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass
next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and
smiled like anything.”
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister,--
“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a
married woman.”
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by
each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the
breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a
charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they
may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the
place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”
“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”
“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at
Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I
will take care to get good partners for them all.”
“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.”
“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.”
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than such as did not.
Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did
everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds
on the first of September than anybody else in the country.
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--
“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?”
“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little
said on the subject.”
“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.
“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,
you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should
have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was
dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a
sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was
thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether
he would be married in his blue coat.
“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.
“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was
called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you
know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so
frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;
and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,
luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set
out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented
going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as
well.”
“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!
I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”
“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”
“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”
“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her
sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.
“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively
speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.”
“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the
letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.”
Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.
[Illustration:
“I am sure she did not listen.”

CHAPTER LII.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.
     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */
“My dear Niece,
     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.
     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming
     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.
     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all
     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he
     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he
     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.
     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after
     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as
     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or
     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken
     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to
     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to
     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a
     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.
     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in
     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----
     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.
     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none
     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill
     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to
     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,
     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but
     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live
     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.
     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have
     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,
     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making
     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such
     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the
     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there
     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he
     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything
     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make
     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not
     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father
     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did
     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly
     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him
     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,
     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called
     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your
     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk
     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It
     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express
     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I
     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,
     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;
     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not
     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,
     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have
     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which
     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it
     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead
     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up
     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely
     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning
     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that
     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or
     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done
     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I
     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another
     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his
     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_
     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.
     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to
     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was
     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter
     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no
     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all
     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it
     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes
     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,
     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual
     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He
     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on
     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever
     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive
     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair
     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The
     children have been wanting me this half hour.
“Yours, very sincerely,
“M. GARDINER.”
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her
sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of
goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be
just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest
extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken
on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he
must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently
meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always
most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard
nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it
was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt
that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his
affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to
overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with
Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from
the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think
how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to
him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she
had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards
him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that
in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better
of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and
again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible
of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly
both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence
subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.
She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;
and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by
Wickham.
“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
as he joined her.
“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.”
“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,
and now we are better.”
“True. Are the others coming out?”
“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.”
She replied in the affirmative.
“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”
“Yes, she did.”
“And what did she say?”
“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.”
“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--
“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”
“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said
Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this
time of year.”
“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.”
“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”
“And do you like her?”
“Very much.”
“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”
“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”
“I do not recollect that we did.”
“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most
delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in
every respect.”
“How should you have liked making sermons?”
“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,
to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the
retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of
happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in Kent?”
“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.”
“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.”
“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--
“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us
quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.”
She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.

CHAPTER LIII.
[Illustration]
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.
The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.
“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”
“Write to me very often, my dear.”
“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do.”
Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”
“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said
Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.”
“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled, and shook her head, by turns.
“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.
Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that
I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I
never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to
Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that
is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”
“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in
Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He
comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--
“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.
“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
will wait on him, of course.”
“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.
“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let
him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.”
“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.”
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--
“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”
“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.”
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days
that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of
seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in
Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
paddock, and ride towards the house.
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.
“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”
“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.”
“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”
“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.”
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.
Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.
The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.
“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her
mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a
painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her courtesy and address of his friend.
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.
Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question
which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.
“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”
She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.
He readily agreed to it.
“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,
George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came
to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.
“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”
continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a
place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not
know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of
his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.
Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
deserves.”
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,
the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the
country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,
“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the coveys for you.”
Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.
“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be
in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!”
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former
lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every
five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her
as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days’ time.
“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you
I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
engagement.”
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.

CHAPTER LIV.
[Illustration]
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed
her.
“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
“did he come at all?”
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he
no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think
no more about him.”
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.
“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.”
“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!
take care.”
“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”
“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.”
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,
had revived.
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He
bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.
His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,
than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her
chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for
ever.”
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--
“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?”
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!
“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--
“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”
“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”
“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”
“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough
these three weeks.”
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what
say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I
assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as
good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved
girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”
[Illustration:
     “M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.”
]
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of
Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again.”
Elizabeth smiled.
“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.”
“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.”
“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in
others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?”
“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante.”
[Illustration:
     “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”

CHAPTER LV.
[Illustration]
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”
He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she
would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
them.
“Can you come to-morrow?”
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her
dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--
“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy’s hair.”
“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”
“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!
where is your sash, my dear?”
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”
“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--
“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a
few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--
“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”
Elizabeth was forced to go.
“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room.”
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.
Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was
everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged
officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
daughter.
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away
an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s
means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the
happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s
concurrence.
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get
everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to
write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.
But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,
she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her
mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she
perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as
if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but
_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by
either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,
whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,
why is not everybody as happy?”
Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.
“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.
“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious
circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.
“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”
He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,--
“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.
“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.”
“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in _me_.”
“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!”
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but
she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always
attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and
when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible.”
“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for
it?”
“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
can never be what we once were to each other.”
“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”
“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he
really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent
would have prevented his coming down again?”
“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.”
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.
Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.
“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such
another man for you!”
“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and
she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER LVI.
[Illustration]
One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.
Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--
“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother?”
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”
“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.
“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”
“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a
short silence.
“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I
assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”
“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in
summer: the windows are full west.”
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,--
“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well?”
“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some
refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--
“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.”
“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
decent-looking rooms, walked on.
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.
[Illustration:
“After a short survey”
[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--
“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.”
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.”
“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.”
“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”
“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”
“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.”
“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?”
“I never heard that it was.”
“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”
“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_
may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”
“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.”
“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”
“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce me to be explicit.”
“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”
“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.”
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--
“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the
union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”
“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”
“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.”
“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.”
“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I
be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”
“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_.”
“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall
not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”
“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are
equal.”
“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.”
“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”
“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment’s deliberation,--
“I am not.”
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”
“I will make no promise of the kind.”
“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require.”
“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the
subject.”
“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son
of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of
what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”
“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.”
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.
“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”
“You are then resolved to have him?”
“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”
“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.”
“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I
shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--
“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”
“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”
Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

CHAPTER LVII.
[Illustration]
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at
Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had
only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had
looked forward to as possible at some future time.
In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an
application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.”
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might
be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.
She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He
then said,--
“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself, when her father continued,--
“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”
“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”
“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages
in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?
‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the
heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and
extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn
my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,
you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,
Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for
cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,
Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly
eye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!”
Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.
“Are you not diverted?”
“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”
“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of
some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give
her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my
duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she
and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.
Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as
a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of
Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear
Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,
Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be
_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For
what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
in our turn?”
“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so
strange!”
“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER LVIII.
[Illustration]
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.
They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was
high, she immediately said,--
“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”
“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.”
“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.”
“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_.”
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.”
Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings
which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection
every moment more valuable.
They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.”
“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”
“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,
improved in civility.”
“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I
confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”
“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.”
“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.”
“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”
She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
her former prejudices had been removed.
“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,
especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power
of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly
make you hate me.”
“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.”
“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.”
“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely
different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my
philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.”
“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),
I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a
doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”
“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”
“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”
“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”
“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to
take a proper direction.”
“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”
“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”
“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”
“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half
an hour after I had seen you.”
He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther.
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.
“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.
“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.
“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”
“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.
“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told
him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.
“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”
“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”
“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”
“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one
thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now.”
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of
Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.

CHAPTER LIX.
[Illustration]
“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”
“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;
and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I
am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we
are engaged.”
Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.”
“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.”
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously, assured her of its truth.
“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried
Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you
certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?”
“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we
are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?
Shall you like to have such a brother?”
“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?”
“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I
tell you all.”
“What do you mean?”
“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.”
“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.
Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?”
“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;
but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.”
Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.
“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I
always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you.”
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.
“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s
way.”
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.”
“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,
saying,--
“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is
all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he
wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?”
“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
indifference?”
“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.”
“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.”
“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your
disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.”
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the
match.
“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”
Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what
was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.
“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a
special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.
But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond
of, that I may have it to-morrow.”
This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.
“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane’s.”

CHAPTER LX.
[Illustration]
Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could
you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?”
“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun.”
“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be
sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”
“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”
“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.”
“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?”
“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you
first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you
called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”
“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”
“But I was embarrassed.”
“And so was I.”
“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”
“A man who had felt less might.”
“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject? This will never do.”
“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to
wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,
and I was determined at once to know everything.”
“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequences?”
“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and
if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”
“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?”
“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to
be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directly.”
“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:--
“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,
indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more
than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to
the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the
ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the
happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
can be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours,” etc.
Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return
for his last.
     /* “Dear Sir, */
     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as
     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has
     more to give.
“Yours sincerely,” etc.
Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to
Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much
kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was
as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s
good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be
vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at
all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to
shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to
keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its
pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward
with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so
little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their
family party at Pemberley.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER LXI.
[Illustration]
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be
guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of
her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,
it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous
and invariably silly.
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s
society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of
everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be
prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which
Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by
his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The
letter was to this effect:--
     /* “My dear Lizzy, */
     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear
     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you
     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.
“Yours,” etc.
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a
cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection
for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never
receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him
further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when
her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the
Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even
Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_
of giving them a hint to be gone.
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.
Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

forth in Section 3 below.
1.F.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
“without pictures or conversations?”
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.
There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.
“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)
Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how
many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what
an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”
(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and
sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer
either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought
poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here
before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large
letters.
It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,
“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.
However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *
“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a
telescope.”
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”
said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.
“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two
people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!”
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said
Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll
get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which
way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears
“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m
sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be
kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.”
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must
go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending
presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     Alice’s love_).
Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like
you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,
sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do:—
“How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!
“How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!”
“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve
made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’
I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down
here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!”
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while
she was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be
growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and
now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than
ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by
railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.
“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.
“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she
began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of
a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.
“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like
cats.”
“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would
_you_ like cats if you were me?”
“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk
about her any more if you’d rather not.”
“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name
again!”
“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when
you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.
So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my
history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am
older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make
you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria—’”
“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.
“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did
you speak?”
“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.
“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”
“Found _what_?” said the Duck.
“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know
what ‘it’ means.”
“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the
Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?”
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.
“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to
dry me at all.”
“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies—”
“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.
“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact
shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and
away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”
“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.
“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.
“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.
“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in
your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.
“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.
“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why
it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.
“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.
“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:—
         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve
         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’
         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”
“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are
you thinking of?”
“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?”
“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”
“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”
“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,
you know!”
The Mouse only growled in reply.
“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”
“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”
“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the
Lory.
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you
can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in
bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.
“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.
CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.
“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How
surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him
his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.
“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,
nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I
don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!”
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so
I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large
again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t
grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t
drunk quite so much!”
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and
yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a
sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”
“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but
then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”
“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!”
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll
go round and get in at the window.”
“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And
then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!”
“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and
help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)
“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”
“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)
“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!”
“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”
“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what
they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other
ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!
fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em
together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do
well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!
Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I
fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do
it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says
you’re to go down the chimney!”
“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to
herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in
Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little!”
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”
then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then
silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy
now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!”
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought
Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m
a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”
“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.
“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice
called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the
roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”
“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to
this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that
again!” which produced another dead silence.
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose.”
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.
“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.”
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little
thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that
I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?”
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
anything else.
CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.”
“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain
yourself!”
“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m
not myself, you see.”
“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.
“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,
“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.”
“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little
queer, won’t you?”
“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”
“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”
“Why?” said the Caterpillar.
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.
“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something
important to say!”
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.
“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.
“No,” said the Caterpillar.
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you
think you’re changed, do you?”
“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I
used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”
“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all
came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
“Repeat, ‘_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.
Alice folded her hands, and began:—
“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,
    “And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”
“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,
    “I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.”
“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
    Pray, what is the reason of that?”
“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    “I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
    Allow me to sell you a couple?”
“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”
“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.”
“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
    What made you so awfully clever?”
“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”
“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.
“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the
words have got altered.”
“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
“What size do you want to be?” it asked.
“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one
doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”
“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t
mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”
“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily
offended!”
“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.”
“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to
herself.
“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.
“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.
*      *      *      *      *      *      *
    *      *      *      *      *      *
*      *      *      *      *      *      *
“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.
“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”
“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!”
“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.
“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried
hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those
serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;
“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”
“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.
“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”
“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”
“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to
invent something!”
“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.
“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s
no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!”
“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.”
“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then
they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”
“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want
_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”
“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m
going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for
two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.
“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”
“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on
without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”
she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”
she repeated, aloud.
“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.
“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first
question, you know.”
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really
dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.
It’s enough to drive one crazy!”
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for
days and days.”
“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.
“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.
“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s
perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why
your cat grins like that?”
“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—
“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t
know that cats _could_ grin.”
“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”
“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.
“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.
“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”
“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”
“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? I—”
“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide
figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:
“Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.”
CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):
“Wow! wow! wow!”
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:—
“I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!”
CHORUS.
“Wow! wow! wow!”
“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”
thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be
murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.”
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only
sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.
No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”
said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to
herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.
“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long
enough.”
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. “What sort of people live about here?”
“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”
“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.
“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.
You’re mad.”
“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.
“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”
Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how
do you know that you’re mad?”
“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”
“I suppose so,” said Alice.
“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,
and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,
and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”
“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.
“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?”
“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited
yet.”
“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.
“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly
forgotten to ask.”
“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.
“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she
said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it
was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.
“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”
“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a
grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”
CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,
I suppose it doesn’t mind.”
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.
“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.
“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.
“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said
the March Hare.
“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great
many more than three.”
“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.
“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some
severity; “it’s very rude.”
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”
“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve
begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.
“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said
the March Hare.
“Exactly so,” said Alice.
“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.
“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I
say—that’s the same thing, you know.”
“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well
say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what
I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”
“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing
as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”
“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasn’t much.
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month
is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.
Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”
“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit
the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.
“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:
“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,
you know.”
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a
funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t
tell what o’clock it is!”
“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?”
“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.”
“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite
understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.
“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”
“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.
“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”
“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.
“Nor I,” said the March Hare.
Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the
time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.”
“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk
about wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.
“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”
“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.”
“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!”
(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I
shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”
“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.”
“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We
quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!’
You know the song, perhaps?”
“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.
“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—
‘Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.
“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his
head!’”
“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.
“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t
do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”
A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?” she asked.
“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,
and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”
“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.
“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”
“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured
to ask.
“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.
“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And
they pinched it on both sides at once.
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”
“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.
“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.
“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again
before it’s done.”
“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well—”
“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest
in questions of eating and drinking.
“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.
“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;
“they’d have been ill.”
“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?”
“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t
take more.”
“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to
take _more_ than nothing.”
“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.
“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, “It was a treacle-well.”
“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for
yourself.”
“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_.”
“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,
you know—”
“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place
on.”
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?”
“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”
“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark.
“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.
“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of
things—everything that begins with an M—”
“Why with an M?” said Alice.
“Why not?” said the March Hare.
Alice was silent.
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say
things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?”
“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t
think—”
“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.
“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!”
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But
everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And
in she went.
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
and the cool fountains.
CHAPTER VIII.
The Queen’s Croquet-Ground
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me
like that!”
“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my
elbow.”
On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!”
“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”
“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.
“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.
“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust
things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.
“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are
painting those roses?”
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a
procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,
and waited.
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”
“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after
all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”
“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.
“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s
no business of _mine_.”
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”
“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my
dear: she is only a child!”
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn
them over!”
The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.
“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing
here?”
“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”
“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.
“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.
“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.
“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted
in reply.
“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.
“Yes!” shouted Alice.
“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.
“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”
“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under
sentence of execution.”
“What for?” said Alice.
“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.
“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
‘What for?’”
“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said—”
“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a
minute.
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any
one left alive!”
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to.”
“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use
speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one
of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear
oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the
arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!”
“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.
“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”
The Queen smiled and passed on.
“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.
“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to
introduce it.”
“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.”
“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.
“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like
that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.
“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,
but I don’t remember where.”
“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!”
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.
“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t
matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.
The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.
The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.
The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in
less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)
Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the
Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”
“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”
And the executioner went off like an arrow.
The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.
CHAPTER IX.
The Mock Turtle’s Story
“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,
and they walked off together.
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.
“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes
them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be
so stingy about it, you know—”
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.”
“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.
“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only
you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as
she spoke.
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.
“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.
“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,
’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”
“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding
their own business!”
“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of
_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.’”
“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to
herself.
“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”
the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”
“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.
“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”
“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.
“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of
putting things!”
“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.
“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.’”
“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”
“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that
is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more
simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.’”
“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,
“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”
“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.
“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said
Alice.
“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present
of everything I’ve said as yet.”
“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give
birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out
loud.
“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.
“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.
“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and
the m—”
But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.
“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!”
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay
would cost them their lives.
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with
her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”
“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”
“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.
“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.
“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history.”
As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a
good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy
thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.
“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.
“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!”
“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all
his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.
“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your
history, she do.”
“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit
down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”
But she waited patiently.
“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real
Turtle.”
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.
“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”
“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.
“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle
angrily: “really you are very dull!”
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all
day about it!” and he went on in these words:
“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”
“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.
“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.
“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.
“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”
“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so
proud as all that.”
“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”
“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.
“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.
“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”
“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom
of the sea.”
“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I
only took the regular course.”
“What was that?” inquired Alice.
“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle
replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”
“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of
uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”
“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”
“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.”
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”
“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.”
“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.
“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”
“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”
“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”
“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.
“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.
“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so
on.”
“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.
“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:
“because they lessen from day to day.”
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?”
“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.
“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.
“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”
CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:—
“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said
Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”
(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and
said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!”
“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”
“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the
sea-shore—”
“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”
“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.
“—you advance twice—”
“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.
“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”
“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.
“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”
“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
“—as far out to sea as you can—”
“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.
“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.
“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.
“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.
“Very much indeed,” said Alice.
“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”
“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:—
“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?
“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France—
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”
“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!”
“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,
of course?”
“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself
hastily.
“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”
“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in
their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”
“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.
“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”
“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.”
“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you
know why it’s called a whiting?”
“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”
“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated
in a wondering tone.
“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what
makes them so shiny?”
Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”
“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”
“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
“any shrimp could have told you that.”
“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,
please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”
“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”
“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”
“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.
“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”
“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said
Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.”
“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.
“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
“explanations take such a dreadful time.”
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”
“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.
“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.
“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the
Gryphon.
“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”
thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:—
“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”
[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said
the Gryphon.
“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.”
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.
“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.
“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next
verse.”
“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?”
“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it
begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—
“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”
[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet—]
“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle
interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”
“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.
“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon
went on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”
“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old
fellow?”
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:—
“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”
“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the
distance.
“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.
“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—
“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”
CHAPTER XI.
Who Stole the Tarts?
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d
get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to
herself, “because of his great wig.”
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”
(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”
would have done just as well.
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are
they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything
to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”
“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,
“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”
“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the
court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell
“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice
muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—
“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!”
“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.
“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great
deal to come before that!”
“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your
Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.”
“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was,” he said.
“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.
“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.
“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.
“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.
“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.
“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none
of my own. I’m a hatter.”
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.
“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll
have you executed on the spot.”
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.
“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”
“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”
“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.
“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing
too.”
“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in
that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.
“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you
executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”
“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”
“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.
“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.
“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!”
“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after
that—only the March Hare said—”
“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
“You did!” said the Hatter.
“I deny it!” said the March Hare.
“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”
“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.
“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”
“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.
“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.
“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.
“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)
“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”
“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the
King.
“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”
“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get
on better.”
“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.
“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.
“Call the next witness!” said the King.
The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
“Give your evidence,” said the King.
“Shan’t,” said the cook.
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”
“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”
“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.
“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.
“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!”
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.
“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the
next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!”
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they
haven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name “Alice!”
CHAPTER XII.
Alice’s Evidence
“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.
“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.
“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she
said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.”
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.
“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.
“Nothing,” said Alice.
“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.
“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.
“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.
“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,
“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying
which word sounded best.
Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”
Everybody looked at Alice.
“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.
“You are,” said the King.
“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.
“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.”
“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.
“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your
verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been
picked up.”
“What’s in it?” said the Queen.
“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”
“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to
nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”
“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.
“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s
nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”
“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.
“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest
thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)
“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)
“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they
can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”
“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed
your name like an honest man.”
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.
“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.
“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know
what they’re about!”
“Read them,” said the King.
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?” he asked.
“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.”
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—
“They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.
He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?
I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.
If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.
My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.
Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.”
“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the
King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”
“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s
an atom of meaning in it.”
The jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s
an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.
“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t
know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning
to the Knave.
The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)
“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of
course—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know—”
“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.
“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I
think?” he said to the Queen.
“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.)
“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.
“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day.
“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”
“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the
sentence first!”
“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.
“I won’t!” said Alice.
“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.
“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve
had!”
“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:—
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtle’s heavy sobs.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EL REY
Por cuanto por parte de vos, Miguel de Cervantes, nos fue fecha relación
que habíades compuesto un libro intitulado El ingenioso hidalgo de la
Mancha, el cual os había costado mucho trabajo y era muy útil y provechoso,
nos pedistes y suplicastes os mandásemos dar licencia y facultad para le
poder imprimir, y previlegio por el tiempo que fuésemos servidos, o como la
nuestra merced fuese; lo cual visto por los del nuestro Consejo, por cuanto
en el dicho libro se hicieron las diligencias que la premática últimamente
por nos fecha sobre la impresión de los libros dispone, fue acordado que
debíamos mandar dar esta nuestra cédula para vos, en la dicha razón; y nos
tuvímoslo por bien. Por la cual, por os hacer bien y merced, os damos
licencia y facultad para que vos, o la persona que vuestro poder hubiere, y
no otra alguna, podáis imprimir el dicho libro, intitulado El ingenioso
hidalgo de la Mancha, que desuso se hace mención, en todos estos nuestros
reinos de Castilla, por tiempo y espacio de diez años, que corran y se
cuenten desde el dicho día de la data desta nuestra cédula; so pena que la
persona o personas que, sin tener vuestro poder, lo imprimiere o vendiere,
o hiciere imprimir o vender, por el mesmo caso pierda la impresión que
hiciere, con los moldes y aparejos della; y más, incurra en pena de
cincuenta mil maravedís cada vez que lo contrario hiciere. La cual dicha
pena sea la tercia parte para la persona que lo acusare, y la otra tercia
parte para nuestra Cámara, y la otra tercia parte para el juez que lo
sentenciare. Con tanto que todas las veces que hubiéredes de hacer imprimir
el dicho libro, durante el tiempo de los dichos diez años, le traigáis al
nuestro Consejo, juntamente con el original que en él fue visto, que va
rubricado cada plana y firmado al fin dél de Juan Gallo de Andrada, nuestro
Escribano de Cámara, de los que en él residen, para saber si la dicha
impresión está conforme el original; o traigáis fe en pública forma de cómo
por corretor nombrado por nuestro mandado, se vio y corrigió la dicha
impresión por el original, y se imprimió conforme a él, y quedan impresas
las erratas por él apuntadas, para cada un libro de los que así fueren
impresos, para que se tase el precio que por cada volume hubiéredes de
haber. Y mandamos al impresor que así imprimiere el dicho libro, no imprima
el principio ni el primer pliego dél, ni entregue más de un solo libro con
el original al autor, o persona a cuya costa lo imprimiere, ni otro alguno,
para efeto de la dicha correción y tasa, hasta que antes y primero el dicho
libro esté corregido y tasado por los del nuestro Consejo; y, estando
hecho, y no de otra manera, pueda imprimir el dicho principio y primer
pliego, y sucesivamente ponga esta nuestra cédula y la aprobación, tasa y
erratas, so pena de caer e incurrir en las penas contenidas en las leyes y
premáticas destos nuestros reinos. Y mandamos a los del nuestro Consejo, y
a otras cualesquier justicias dellos, guarden y cumplan esta nuestra cédula
y lo en ella contenido. Fecha en Valladolid, a veinte y seis días del mes
de setiembre de mil y seiscientos y cuatro años.

marqués de Gibraleón, conde de Benalcázar y Bañares, vizconde de La Puebla de
Alcocer, señor de las villas de Capilla, Curiel y Burguillos
En fe del buen acogimiento y honra que hace Vuestra Excelencia a toda
suerte de libros, como príncipe tan inclinado a favorecer las buenas artes,
mayormente las que por su nobleza no se abaten al servicio y granjerías del
vulgo, he determinado de sacar a luz al Ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la
Mancha, al abrigo del clarísimo nombre de Vuestra Excelencia, a quien, con
el acatamiento que debo a tanta grandeza, suplico le reciba agradablemente
en su protección, para que a su sombra, aunque desnudo de aquel precioso
ornamento de elegancia y erudición de que suelen andar vestidas las obras
que se componen en las casas de los hombres que saben, ose parecer
seguramente en el juicio de algunos que, continiéndose en los límites de su
ignorancia, suelen condenar con más rigor y menos justicia los trabajos
ajenos; que, poniendo los ojos la prudencia de Vuestra Excelencia en mi
buen deseo, fío que no desdeñará la cortedad de tan humilde servicio.
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.
PRÓLOGO
Desocupado lector: sin juramento me podrás creer que quisiera que este
libro, como hijo del entendimiento, fuera el más hermoso, el más gallardo y
más discreto que pudiera imaginarse. Pero no he podido yo contravenir al
orden de naturaleza; que en ella cada cosa engendra su semejante. Y así,
¿qué podrá engendrar el estéril y mal cultivado ingenio mío, sino la
historia de un hijo seco, avellanado, antojadizo y lleno de pensamientos
varios y nunca imaginados de otro alguno, bien como quien se engendró en
una cárcel, donde toda incomodidad tiene su asiento y donde todo triste
ruido hace su habitación? El sosiego, el lugar apacible, la amenidad de los
campos, la serenidad de los cielos, el murmurar de las fuentes, la quietud
del espíritu son grande parte para que las musas más estériles se muestren
fecundas y ofrezcan partos al mundo que le colmen de maravilla y de
contento. Acontece tener un padre un hijo feo y sin gracia alguna, y el
amor que le tiene le pone una venda en los ojos para que no vea sus faltas,
antes las juzga por discreciones y lindezas y las cuenta a sus amigos por
agudezas y donaires. Pero yo, que, aunque parezco padre, soy padrastro de
Don Quijote, no quiero irme con la corriente del uso, ni suplicarte, casi
con las lágrimas en los ojos, como otros hacen, lector carísimo, que
perdones o disimules las faltas que en este mi hijo vieres; y ni eres su
pariente ni su amigo, y tienes tu alma en tu cuerpo y tu libre albedrío
como el más pintado, y estás en tu casa, donde eres señor della, como el
rey de sus alcabalas, y sabes lo que comúnmente se dice: que debajo de mi
manto, al rey mato. Todo lo cual te esenta y hace libre de todo respecto y
obligación; y así, puedes decir de la historia todo aquello que te
pareciere, sin temor que te calunien por el mal ni te premien por el bien
que dijeres della.
Sólo quisiera dártela monda y desnuda, sin el ornato de prólogo, ni de la
inumerabilidad y catálogo de los acostumbrados sonetos, epigramas y elogios
que al principio de los libros suelen ponerse. Porque te sé decir que,
aunque me costó algún trabajo componerla, ninguno tuve por mayor que hacer
esta prefación que vas leyendo. Muchas veces tomé la pluma para escribille,
y muchas la dejé, por no saber lo que escribiría; y, estando una suspenso,
con el papel delante, la pluma en la oreja, el codo en el bufete y la mano
en la mejilla, pensando lo que diría, entró a deshora un amigo mío,
gracioso y bien entendido, el cual, viéndome tan imaginativo, me preguntó
la causa; y, no encubriéndosela yo, le dije que pensaba en el prólogo que
había de hacer a la historia de don Quijote, y que me tenía de suerte que
ni quería hacerle, ni menos sacar a luz las hazañas de tan noble caballero.
— Porque, ¿cómo queréis vos que no me tenga confuso el qué dirá el antiguo
legislador que llaman vulgo cuando vea que, al cabo de tantos años como ha
que duermo en el silencio del olvido, salgo ahora, con todos mis años a
cuestas, con una leyenda seca como un esparto, ajena de invención, menguada
de estilo, pobre de concetos y falta de toda erudición y doctrina; sin
acotaciones en las márgenes y sin anotaciones en el fin del libro, como veo
que están otros libros, aunque sean fabulosos y profanos, tan llenos de
sentencias de Aristóteles, de Platón y de toda la caterva de filósofos, que
admiran a los leyentes y tienen a sus autores por hombres leídos, eruditos
y elocuentes? ¡Pues qué, cuando citan la Divina Escritura! No dirán sino
que son unos santos Tomases y otros doctores de la Iglesia; guardando en
esto un decoro tan ingenioso, que en un renglón han pintado un enamorado
destraído y en otro hacen un sermoncico cristiano, que es un contento y un
regalo oílle o leelle. De todo esto ha de carecer mi libro, porque ni tengo
qué acotar en el margen, ni qué anotar en el fin, ni menos sé qué autores
sigo en él, para ponerlos al principio, como hacen todos, por las letras
del A.B.C., comenzando en Aristóteles y acabando en Xenofonte y en Zoílo o
Zeuxis, aunque fue maldiciente el uno y pintor el otro. También ha de
carecer mi libro de sonetos al principio, a lo menos de sonetos cuyos
autores sean duques, marqueses, condes, obispos, damas o poetas
celebérrimos; aunque, si yo los pidiese a dos o tres oficiales amigos, yo
sé que me los darían, y tales, que no les igualasen los de aquellos que
tienen más nombre en nuestra España. En fin, señor y amigo mío —proseguí—,
yo determino que el señor don Quijote se quede sepultado en sus archivos en
la Mancha, hasta que el cielo depare quien le adorne de tantas cosas como
le faltan; porque yo me hallo incapaz de remediarlas, por mi insuficiencia
y pocas letras, y porque naturalmente soy poltrón y perezoso de andarme
buscando autores que digan lo que yo me sé decir sin ellos. De aquí nace la
suspensión y elevamiento, amigo, en que me hallastes; bastante causa para
ponerme en ella la que de mí habéis oído.
Oyendo lo cual mi amigo, dándose una palmada en la frente y disparando en
una carga de risa, me dijo:
— Por Dios, hermano, que agora me acabo de desengañar de un engaño en que he
estado todo el mucho tiempo que ha que os conozco, en el cual siempre os he
tenido por discreto y prudente en todas vuestras aciones. Pero agora veo
que estáis tan lejos de serlo como lo está el cielo de la tierra. ¿Cómo que
es posible que cosas de tan poco momento y tan fáciles de remediar puedan
tener fuerzas de suspender y absortar un ingenio tan maduro como el
vuestro, y tan hecho a romper y atropellar por otras dificultades mayores?
A la fe, esto no nace de falta de habilidad, sino de sobra de pereza y
penuria de discurso. ¿Queréis ver si es verdad lo que digo? Pues estadme
atento y veréis cómo, en un abrir y cerrar de ojos, confundo todas vuestras
dificultades y remedio todas las faltas que decís que os suspenden y
acobardan para dejar de sacar a la luz del mundo la historia de vuestro
famoso don Quijote, luz y espejo de toda la caballería andante.
— Decid —le repliqué yo, oyendo lo que me decía—: ¿de qué modo pensáis
llenar el vacío de mi temor y reducir a claridad el caos de mi confusión?
A lo cual él dijo:
— Lo primero en que reparáis de los sonetos, epigramas o elogios que os
faltan para el principio, y que sean de personajes graves y de título, se
puede remediar en que vos mesmo toméis algún trabajo en hacerlos, y después
los podéis bautizar y poner el nombre que quisiéredes, ahijándolos al
Preste Juan de las Indias o al Emperador de Trapisonda, de quien yo sé que
hay noticia que fueron famosos poetas; y cuando no lo hayan sido y hubiere
algunos pedantes y bachilleres que por detrás os muerdan y murmuren desta
verdad, no se os dé dos maravedís; porque, ya que os averigüen la mentira,
no os han de cortar la mano con que lo escribistes.
»En lo de citar en las márgenes los libros y autores de donde sacáredes las
sentencias y dichos que pusiéredes en vuestra historia, no hay más sino
hacer, de manera que venga a pelo, algunas sentencias o latines que vos
sepáis de memoria, o, a lo menos, que os cuesten poco trabajo el buscalle;
como será poner, tratando de libertad y cautiverio:
Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro.
Y luego, en el margen, citar a Horacio, o a quien lo dijo. Si tratáredes
del poder de la muerte, acudir luego con:
Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,
Regumque turres.
Si de la amistad y amor que Dios manda que se tenga al enemigo, entraros
luego al punto por la Escritura Divina, que lo podéis hacer con tantico de
curiosidad, y decir las palabras, por lo menos, del mismo Dios: Ego autem
dico vobis: diligite inimicos vestros. Si tratáredes de malos pensamientos,
acudid con el Evangelio: De corde exeunt cogitationes malae. Si de la
instabilidad de los amigos, ahí está Catón, que os dará su dístico:
Donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos,
tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.
Y con estos latinicos y otros tales os tendrán siquiera por gramático, que
el serlo no es de poca honra y provecho el día de hoy.
»En lo que toca el poner anotaciones al fin del libro, seguramente lo
podéis hacer desta manera: si nombráis algún gigante en vuestro libro,
hacelde que sea el gigante Golías, y con sólo esto, que os costará casi
nada, tenéis una grande anotación, pues podéis poner: El gigante Golías, o
Goliat, fue un filisteo a quien el pastor David mató de una gran pedrada en
el valle de Terebinto, según se cuenta en el Libro de los Reyes, en el
capítulo que vos halláredes que se escribe. Tras esto, para mostraros
hombre erudito en letras humanas y cosmógrafo, haced de modo como en
vuestra historia se nombre el río Tajo, y veréisos luego con otra famosa
anotación, poniendo: El río Tajo fue así dicho por un rey de las Españas;
tiene su nacimiento en tal lugar y muere en el mar océano, besando los
muros de la famosa ciudad de Lisboa; y es opinión que tiene las arenas de
oro, etc. Si tratáredes de ladrones, yo os diré la historia de Caco, que la
sé de coro; si de mujeres rameras, ahí está el obispo de Mondoñedo, que os
prestará a Lamia, Laida y Flora, cuya anotación os dará gran crédito; si de
crueles, Ovidio os entregará a Medea; si de encantadores y hechiceras,
Homero tiene a Calipso, y Virgilio a Circe; si de capitanes valerosos, el
mesmo Julio César os prestará a sí mismo en sus Comentarios, y Plutarco os
dará mil Alejandros. Si tratáredes de amores, con dos onzas que sepáis de
la lengua toscana, toparéis con León Hebreo, que os hincha las medidas. Y
si no queréis andaros por tierras extrañas, en vuestra casa tenéis a
Fonseca, Del amor de Dios, donde se cifra todo lo que vos y el más
ingenioso acertare a desear en tal materia. En resolución, no hay más sino
que vos procuréis nombrar estos nombres, o tocar estas historias en la
vuestra, que aquí he dicho, y dejadme a mí el cargo de poner las
anotaciones y acotaciones; que yo os voto a tal de llenaros las márgenes y
de gastar cuatro pliegos en el fin del libro.
»Vengamos ahora a la citación de los autores que los otros libros tienen,
que en el vuestro os faltan. El remedio que esto tiene es muy fácil, porque
no habéis de hacer otra cosa que buscar un libro que los acote todos, desde
la A hasta la Z, como vos decís. Pues ese mismo abecedario pondréis vos en
vuestro libro; que, puesto que a la clara se vea la mentira, por la poca
necesidad que vos teníades de aprovecharos dellos, no importa nada; y quizá
alguno habrá tan simple, que crea que de todos os habéis aprovechado en la
simple y sencilla historia vuestra; y, cuando no sirva de otra cosa, por lo
menos servirá aquel largo catálogo de autores a dar de improviso autoridad
al libro. Y más, que no habrá quien se ponga a averiguar si los seguistes o
no los seguistes, no yéndole nada en ello. Cuanto más que, si bien caigo en
la cuenta, este vuestro libro no tiene necesidad de ninguna cosa de
aquellas que vos decís que le falta, porque todo él es una invectiva contra
los libros de caballerías, de quien nunca se acordó Aristóteles, ni dijo
nada San Basilio, ni alcanzó Cicerón; ni caen debajo de la cuenta de sus
fabulosos disparates las puntualidades de la verdad, ni las observaciones
de la astrología; ni le son de importancia las medidas geométricas, ni la
confutación de los argumentos de quien se sirve la retórica; ni tiene para
qué predicar a ninguno, mezclando lo humano con lo divino, que es un género
de mezcla de quien no se ha de vestir ningún cristiano entendimiento. Sólo
tiene que aprovecharse de la imitación en lo que fuere escribiendo; que,
cuanto ella fuere más perfecta, tanto mejor será lo que se escribiere. Y,
pues esta vuestra escritura no mira a más que a deshacer la autoridad y
cabida que en el mundo y en el vulgo tienen los libros de caballerías, no
hay para qué andéis mendigando sentencias de filósofos, consejos de la
Divina Escritura, fábulas de poetas, oraciones de retóricos, milagros de
santos, sino procurar que a la llana, con palabras significantes, honestas
y bien colocadas, salga vuestra oración y período sonoro y festivo;
pintando, en todo lo que alcanzáredes y fuere posible, vuestra intención,
dando a entender vuestros conceptos sin intricarlos y escurecerlos.
Procurad también que, leyendo vuestra historia, el melancólico se mueva a
risa, el risueño la acreciente, el simple no se enfade, el discreto se
admire de la invención, el grave no la desprecie, ni el prudente deje de
alabarla. En efecto, llevad la mira puesta a derribar la máquina mal
fundada destos caballerescos libros, aborrecidos de tantos y alabados de
muchos más; que si esto alcanzásedes, no habríades alcanzado poco.
Con silencio grande estuve escuchando lo que mi amigo me decía, y de tal
manera se imprimieron en mí sus razones que, sin ponerlas en disputa, las
aprobé por buenas y de ellas mismas quise hacer este prólogo; en el cual
verás, lector suave, la discreción de mi amigo, la buena ventura mía en
hallar en tiempo tan necesitado tal consejero, y el alivio tuyo en hallar
tan sincera y tan sin revueltas la historia del famoso don Quijote de la
Mancha, de quien hay opinión, por todos los habitadores del distrito del
campo de Montiel, que fue el más casto enamorado y el más valiente
caballero que de muchos años a esta parte se vio en aquellos contornos. Yo
no quiero encarecerte el servicio que te hago en darte a conocer tan noble
y tan honrado caballero, pero quiero que me agradezcas el conocimiento que
tendrás del famoso Sancho Panza, su escudero, en quien, a mi parecer, te
doy cifradas todas las gracias escuderiles que en la caterva de los libros
vanos de caballerías están esparcidas.
Y con esto, Dios te dé salud, y a mí no olvide. Vale.

AMADÍS DE GAULA A DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA
Soneto
Tú, que imitaste la llorosa vida
que tuve, ausente y desdeñado sobre
el gran ribazo de la Peña Pobre,
de alegre a penitencia reducida;
tú, a quien los ojos dieron la bebida
de abundante licor, aunque salobre,
y alzándote la plata, estaño y cobre,
te dio la tierra en tierra la comida,
vive seguro de que eternamente,
en tanto, al menos, que en la cuarta esfera,
sus caballos aguije el rubio Apolo,
tendrás claro renombre de valiente;
tu patria será en todas la primera;
tu sabio autor, al mundo único y solo.
DON BELIANÍS DE GRECIA A DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA
Soneto
Rompí, corté, abollé, y dije y hice
más que en el orbe caballero andante;
fui diestro, fui valiente, fui arrogante;
mil agravios vengué, cien mil deshice.
Hazañas di a la Fama que eternice;
fui comedido y regalado amante;
fue enano para mí todo gigante,
y al duelo en cualquier punto satisfice.
Tuve a mis pies postrada la Fortuna,
y trajo del copete mi cordura
a la calva Ocasión al estricote.
Más, aunque sobre el cuerno de la luna
siempre se vio encumbrada mi ventura,
tus proezas envidio, ¡oh gran Quijote!
LA SEÑORA ORIANA A DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
Soneto
¡Oh, quién tuviera, hermosa Dulcinea,
por más comodidad y más reposo,
a Miraflores puesto en el Toboso,
y trocara sus Londres con tu aldea!
¡Oh, quién de tus deseos y librea
alma y cuerpo adornara, y del famoso
caballero que hiciste venturoso
mirara alguna desigual pelea!
¡Oh, quién tan castamente se escapara
del señor Amadís como tú hiciste
del comedido hidalgo don Quijote!
Que así envidiada fuera, y no envidiara,
y fuera alegre el tiempo que fue triste,
y gozara los gustos sin escote.
GANDALÍN, ESCUDERO DE AMADÍS DE GAULA, A SANCHO PANZA, ESCUDERO DE DON QUIJOTE
Soneto
Salve, varón famoso, a quien Fortuna,
cuando en el trato escuderil te puso,
tan blanda y cuerdamente lo dispuso,
que lo pasaste sin desgracia alguna.
Ya la azada o la hoz poco repugna
al andante ejercicio; ya está en uso
la llaneza escudera, con que acuso
al soberbio que intenta hollar la luna.
Envidio a tu jumento y a tu nombre,
y a tus alforjas igualmente invidio,
que mostraron tu cuerda providencia.
Salve otra vez, ¡oh Sancho!, tan buen hombre,
que a solo tú nuestro español Ovidio
con buzcorona te hace reverencia.

Soneto
Si no eres par, tampoco le has tenido:
que par pudieras ser entre mil pares;
ni puede haberle donde tú te hallares,
invito vencedor, jamás vencido.
Orlando soy, Quijote, que, perdido
por Angélica, vi remotos mares,
ofreciendo a la Fama en sus altares
aquel valor que respetó el olvido.
No puedo ser tu igual; que este decoro
se debe a tus proezas y a tu fama,
puesto que, como yo, perdiste el seso.
Mas serlo has mío, si al soberbio moro
y cita fiero domas, que hoy nos llama
iguales en amor con mal suceso.
EL CABALLERO DEL FEBO A DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA
Soneto
A vuestra espada no igualó la mía,
Febo español, curioso cortesano,
ni a la alta gloria de valor mi mano,
que rayo fue do nace y muere el día.
Imperios desprecié; la monarquía
que me ofreció el Oriente rojo en vano
dejé, por ver el rostro soberano
de Claridiana, aurora hermosa mía.
Améla por milagro único y raro,
y, ausente en su desgracia, el propio infierno
temió mi brazo, que domó su rabia.
Mas vos, godo Quijote, ilustre y claro,
por Dulcinea sois al mundo eterno,
y ella, por vos, famosa, honesta y sabia.
DE SOLISDÁN A DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA
Soneto
Maguer, señor Quijote, que sandeces
vos tengan el cerbelo derrumbado,
nunca seréis de alguno reprochado
por home de obras viles y soeces.
Serán vuesas fazañas los joeces,
pues tuertos desfaciendo habéis andado,
siendo vegadas mil apaleado
por follones cautivos y raheces.
Y si la vuesa linda Dulcinea
desaguisado contra vos comete,
ni a vuesas cuitas muestra buen talante,
en tal desmán, vueso conorte sea
que Sancho Panza fue mal alcagüete,
necio él, dura ella, y vos no amante.
DIÁLOGO ENTRE BABIECA Y ROCINANTE
Soneto
B. ¿Cómo estáis, Rocinante, tan delgado?
R. Porque nunca se come, y se trabaja.
B. Pues, ¿qué es de la cebada y de la paja?
R. No me deja mi amo ni un bocado.
B. Andá, señor, que estáis muy mal criado,
pues vuestra lengua de asno al amo ultraja.
R. Asno se es de la cuna a la mortaja.
¿Queréislo ver? Miraldo enamorado.
B. ¿Es necedad amar? R. No es gran prudencia.
B. Metafísico estáis. R. Es que no como.
B. Quejaos del escudero. R. No es bastante.
¿Cómo me he de quejar en mi dolencia,
si el amo y escudero o mayordomo
son tan rocines como Rocinante?
Primera parte del ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha
Capítulo primero. Que trata de la condición y ejercicio del famoso hidalgo
don Quijote de la Mancha
En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho
tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua,
rocín flaco y galgo corredor. Una olla de algo más vaca que carnero,
salpicón las más noches, duelos y quebrantos los sábados, lantejas los
viernes, algún palomino de añadidura los domingos, consumían las tres
partes de su hacienda. El resto della concluían sayo de velarte, calzas de
velludo para las fiestas, con sus pantuflos de lo mesmo, y los días de
entresemana se honraba con su vellorí de lo más fino. Tenía en su casa una
ama que pasaba de los cuarenta, y una sobrina que no llegaba a los veinte,
y un mozo de campo y plaza, que así ensillaba el rocín como tomaba la
podadera. Frisaba la edad de nuestro hidalgo con los cincuenta años; era de
complexión recia, seco de carnes, enjuto de rostro, gran madrugador y amigo
de la caza. Quieren decir que tenía el sobrenombre de Quijada, o Quesada,
que en esto hay alguna diferencia en los autores que deste caso escriben;
aunque, por conjeturas verosímiles, se deja entender que se llamaba
Quejana. Pero esto importa poco a nuestro cuento; basta que en la narración
dél no se salga un punto de la verdad.
Es, pues, de saber que este sobredicho hidalgo, los ratos que estaba
ocioso, que eran los más del año, se daba a leer libros de caballerías, con
tanta afición y gusto, que olvidó casi de todo punto el ejercicio de la
caza, y aun la administración de su hacienda. Y llegó a tanto su curiosidad
y desatino en esto, que vendió muchas hanegas de tierra de sembradura para
comprar libros de caballerías en que leer, y así, llevó a su casa todos
cuantos pudo haber dellos; y de todos, ningunos le parecían tan bien como
los que compuso el famoso Feliciano de Silva, porque la claridad de su
prosa y aquellas entricadas razones suyas le parecían de perlas, y más
cuando llegaba a leer aquellos requiebros y cartas de desafíos, donde en
muchas partes hallaba escrito: La razón de la sinrazón que a mi razón se
hace, de tal manera mi razón enflaquece, que con razón me quejo de la
vuestra fermosura. Y también cuando leía: ...los altos cielos que de
vuestra divinidad divinamente con las estrellas os fortifican, y os hacen
merecedora del merecimiento que merece la vuestra grandeza.
Con estas razones perdía el pobre caballero el juicio, y desvelábase por
entenderlas y desentrañarles el sentido, que no se lo sacara ni las
entendiera el mesmo Aristóteles, si resucitara para sólo ello. No estaba
muy bien con las heridas que don Belianís daba y recebía, porque se
imaginaba que, por grandes maestros que le hubiesen curado, no dejaría de
tener el rostro y todo el cuerpo lleno de cicatrices y señales. Pero, con
todo, alababa en su autor aquel acabar su libro con la promesa de aquella
inacabable aventura, y muchas veces le vino deseo de tomar la pluma y dalle
fin al pie de la letra, como allí se promete; y sin duda alguna lo hiciera,
y aun saliera con ello, si otros mayores y continuos pensamientos no se lo
estorbaran. Tuvo muchas veces competencia con el cura de su lugar —que era
hombre docto, graduado en Sigüenza—, sobre cuál había sido mejor caballero:
Palmerín de Ingalaterra o Amadís de Gaula; mas maese Nicolás, barbero del
mesmo pueblo, decía que ninguno llegaba al Caballero del Febo, y que si
alguno se le podía comparar, era don Galaor, hermano de Amadís de Gaula,
porque tenía muy acomodada condición para todo; que no era caballero
melindroso, ni tan llorón como su hermano, y que en lo de la valentía no le
iba en zaga.
En resolución, él se enfrascó tanto en su letura, que se le pasaban las
noches leyendo de claro en claro, y los días de turbio en turbio; y así,
del poco dormir y del mucho leer, se le secó el celebro, de manera que vino
a perder el juicio. Llenósele la fantasía de todo aquello que leía en los
libros, así de encantamentos como de pendencias, batallas, desafíos,
heridas, requiebros, amores, tormentas y disparates imposibles; y
asentósele de tal modo en la imaginación que era verdad toda aquella
máquina de aquellas sonadas soñadas invenciones que leía, que para él no
había otra historia más cierta en el mundo. Decía él que el Cid Ruy Díaz
había sido muy buen caballero, pero que no tenía que ver con el Caballero
de la Ardiente Espada, que de sólo un revés había partido por medio dos
fieros y descomunales gigantes. Mejor estaba con Bernardo del Carpio,
porque en Roncesvalles había muerto a Roldán el encantado, valiéndose de la
industria de Hércules, cuando ahogó a Anteo, el hijo de la Tierra, entre
los brazos. Decía mucho bien del gigante Morgante, porque, con ser de
aquella generación gigantea, que todos son soberbios y descomedidos, él
solo era afable y bien criado. Pero, sobre todos, estaba bien con Reinaldos
de Montalbán, y más cuando le veía salir de su castillo y robar cuantos
topaba, y cuando en allende robó aquel ídolo de Mahoma que era todo de oro,
según dice su historia. Diera él, por dar una mano de coces al traidor de
Galalón, al ama que tenía, y aun a su sobrina de añadidura.
En efeto, rematado ya su juicio, vino a dar en el más estraño pensamiento
que jamás dio loco en el mundo; y fue que le pareció convenible y
necesario, así para el aumento de su honra como para el servicio de su
república, hacerse caballero andante, y irse por todo el mundo con sus
armas y caballo a buscar las aventuras y a ejercitarse en todo aquello que
él había leído que los caballeros andantes se ejercitaban, deshaciendo todo
género de agravio, y poniéndose en ocasiones y peligros donde, acabándolos,
cobrase eterno nombre y fama. Imaginábase el pobre ya coronado por el valor
de su brazo, por lo menos, del imperio de Trapisonda; y así, con estos tan
agradables pensamientos, llevado del estraño gusto que en ellos sentía, se
dio priesa a poner en efeto lo que deseaba.
Y lo primero que hizo fue limpiar unas armas que habían sido de sus
bisabuelos, que, tomadas de orín y llenas de moho, luengos siglos había que
estaban puestas y olvidadas en un rincón. Limpiólas y aderezólas lo mejor
que pudo, pero vio que tenían una gran falta, y era que no tenían celada de
encaje, sino morrión simple; mas a esto suplió su industria, porque de
cartones hizo un modo de media celada, que, encajada con el morrión, hacían
una apariencia de celada entera. Es verdad que para probar si era fuerte y
podía estar al riesgo de una cuchillada, sacó su espada y le dio dos
golpes, y con el primero y en un punto deshizo lo que había hecho en una
semana; y no dejó de parecerle mal la facilidad con que la había hecho
pedazos, y, por asegurarse deste peligro, la tornó a hacer de nuevo,
poniéndole unas barras de hierro por de dentro, de tal manera que él quedó
satisfecho de su fortaleza; y, sin querer hacer nueva experiencia della, la
diputó y tuvo por celada finísima de encaje.
Fue luego a ver su rocín, y, aunque tenía más cuartos que un real y más
tachas que el caballo de Gonela, que tantum pellis et ossa fuit, le pareció
que ni el Bucéfalo de Alejandro ni Babieca el del Cid con él se igualaban.
Cuatro días se le pasaron en imaginar qué nombre le pondría; porque, según
se decía él a sí mesmo, no era razón que caballo de caballero tan famoso, y
tan bueno él por sí, estuviese sin nombre conocido; y ansí, procuraba
acomodársele de manera que declarase quién había sido, antes que fuese de
caballero andante, y lo que era entonces; pues estaba muy puesto en razón
que, mudando su señor estado, mudase él también el nombre, y le cobrase
famoso y de estruendo, como convenía a la nueva orden y al nuevo ejercicio
que ya profesaba. Y así, después de muchos nombres que formó, borró y
quitó, añadió, deshizo y tornó a hacer en su memoria e imaginación, al fin
le vino a llamar Rocinante: nombre, a su parecer, alto, sonoro y
significativo de lo que había sido cuando fue rocín, antes de lo que ahora
era, que era antes y primero de todos los rocines del mundo.
Puesto nombre, y tan a su gusto, a su caballo, quiso ponérsele a sí mismo,
y en este pensamiento duró otros ocho días, y al cabo se vino a llamar don
Quijote; de donde —como queda dicho— tomaron ocasión los autores desta tan
verdadera historia que, sin duda, se debía de llamar Quijada, y no Quesada,
como otros quisieron decir. Pero, acordándose que el valeroso Amadís no
sólo se había contentado con llamarse Amadís a secas, sino que añadió el
nombre de su reino y patria, por Hepila famosa, y se llamó Amadís de Gaula,
así quiso, como buen caballero, añadir al suyo el nombre de la suya y
llamarse don Quijote de la Mancha, con que, a su parecer, declaraba muy al
vivo su linaje y patria, y la honraba con tomar el sobrenombre della.
Limpias, pues, sus armas, hecho del morrión celada, puesto nombre a su
rocín y confirmándose a sí mismo, se dio a entender que no le faltaba otra
cosa sino buscar una dama de quien enamorarse; porque el caballero andante
sin amores era árbol sin hojas y sin fruto y cuerpo sin alma. Decíase él
a sí:
— Si yo, por malos de mis pecados, o por mi buena suerte, me encuentro por
ahí con algún gigante, como de ordinario les acontece a los caballeros
andantes, y le derribo de un encuentro, o le parto por mitad del cuerpo, o,
finalmente, le venzo y le rindo, ¿no será bien tener a quien enviarle
presentado y que entre y se hinque de rodillas ante mi dulce señora, y diga
con voz humilde y rendido: ''Yo, señora, soy el gigante Caraculiambro,
señor de la ínsula Malindrania, a quien venció en singular batalla el
jamás como se debe alabado caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, el cual me
mandó que me presentase ante vuestra merced, para que la vuestra grandeza
disponga de mí a su talante''?
¡Oh, cómo se holgó nuestro buen caballero cuando hubo hecho este discurso,
y más cuando halló a quien dar nombre de su dama! Y fue, a lo que se cree,
que en un lugar cerca del suyo había una moza labradora de muy buen
parecer, de quien él un tiempo anduvo enamorado, aunque, según se entiende,
ella jamás lo supo, ni le dio cata dello. Llamábase Aldonza Lorenzo, y a
ésta le pareció ser bien darle título de señora de sus pensamientos; y,
buscándole nombre que no desdijese mucho del suyo, y que tirase y se
encaminase al de princesa y gran señora, vino a llamarla Dulcinea del
Toboso, porque era natural del Toboso; nombre, a su parecer, músico y
peregrino y significativo, como todos los demás que a él y a sus cosas
había puesto.
Capítulo II. Que trata de la primera salida que de su tierra hizo el
ingenioso don Quijote
Hechas, pues, estas prevenciones, no quiso aguardar más tiempo a poner en
efeto su pensamiento, apretándole a ello la falta que él pensaba que hacía
en el mundo su tardanza, según eran los agravios que pensaba deshacer,
tuertos que enderezar, sinrazones que emendar, y abusos que mejorar y
deudas que satisfacer. Y así, sin dar parte a persona alguna de su
intención, y sin que nadie le viese, una mañana, antes del día, que era uno
de los calurosos del mes de julio, se armó de todas sus armas, subió sobre
Rocinante, puesta su mal compuesta celada, embrazó su adarga, tomó su
lanza, y, por la puerta falsa de un corral, salió al campo con grandísimo
contento y alborozo de ver con cuánta facilidad había dado principio a su
buen deseo. Mas, apenas se vio en el campo, cuando le asaltó un pensamiento
terrible, y tal, que por poco le hiciera dejar la comenzada empresa; y fue
que le vino a la memoria que no era armado caballero, y que, conforme a ley
de caballería, ni podía ni debía tomar armas con ningún caballero; y,
puesto que lo fuera, había de llevar armas blancas, como novel caballero,
sin empresa en el escudo, hasta que por su esfuerzo la ganase. Estos
pensamientos le hicieron titubear en su propósito; mas, pudiendo más su
locura que otra razón alguna, propuso de hacerse armar caballero del
primero que topase, a imitación de otros muchos que así lo hicieron, según
él había leído en los libros que tal le tenían. En lo de las armas blancas,
pensaba limpiarlas de manera, en teniendo lugar, que lo fuesen más que un
armiño; y con esto se quietó y prosiguió su camino, sin llevar otro que
aquel que su caballo quería, creyendo que en aquello consistía la fuerza de
las aventuras.
Yendo, pues, caminando nuestro flamante aventurero, iba hablando consigo
mesmo y diciendo:
— ¿Quién duda sino que en los venideros tiempos, cuando salga a luz la
verdadera historia de mis famosos hechos, que el sabio que los escribiere
no ponga, cuando llegue a contar esta mi primera salidad tan de mañana,
desta manera?: «Apenas había el rubicundo Apolo tendido por la faz de la
ancha y espaciosa tierra las doradas hebras de sus hermosos cabellos, y
apenas los pequeños y pintados pajarillos con sus arpadas lenguas habían
saludado con dulce y meliflua armonía la venida de la rosada aurora, que,
dejando la blanda cama del celoso marido, por las puertas y balcones del
manchego horizonte a los mortales se mostraba, cuando el famoso caballero
don Quijote de la Mancha, dejando las ociosas plumas, subió sobre su famoso
caballo Rocinante, y comenzó a caminar por el antiguo y conocido campo de
Montiel».
Y era la verdad que por él caminaba. Y añadió diciendo:
— Dichosa edad, y siglo dichoso aquel adonde saldrán a luz las famosas
hazañas mías, dignas de entallarse en bronces, esculpirse en mármoles y
pintarse en tablas para memoria en lo futuro. ¡Oh tú, sabio encantador,
quienquiera que seas, a quien ha de tocar el ser coronista desta peregrina
historia, ruégote que no te olvides de mi buen Rocinante, compañero eterno
mío en todos mis caminos y carreras!
Luego volvía diciendo, como si verdaderamente fuera enamorado:
— ¡Oh princesa Dulcinea, señora deste cautivo corazón!, mucho agravio me
habedes fecho en despedirme y reprocharme con el riguroso afincamiento de
mandarme no parecer ante la vuestra fermosura. Plégaos, señora, de
membraros deste vuestro sujeto corazón, que tantas cuitas por vuestro amor
padece.
Con éstos iba ensartando otros disparates, todos al modo de los que sus
libros le habían enseñado, imitando en cuanto podía su lenguaje. Con esto,
caminaba tan despacio, y el sol entraba tan apriesa y con tanto ardor, que
fuera bastante a derretirle los sesos, si algunos tuviera.
Casi todo aquel día caminó sin acontecerle cosa que de contar fuese, de lo
cual se desesperaba, porque quisiera topar luego luego con quien hacer
experiencia del valor de su fuerte brazo. Autores hay que dicen que la
primera aventura que le avino fue la del Puerto Lápice; otros dicen que la
de los molinos de viento; pero, lo que yo he podido averiguar en este caso,
y lo que he hallado escrito en los Anales de la Mancha, es que él anduvo
todo aquel día, y, al anochecer, su rocín y él se hallaron cansados y
muertos de hambre; y que, mirando a todas partes por ver si descubriría
algún castillo o alguna majada de pastores donde recogerse y adonde pudiese
remediar su mucha hambre y necesidad, vio, no lejos del camino por donde
iba, una venta, que fue como si viera una estrella que, no a los portales,
sino a los alcázares de su redención le encaminaba. Diose priesa a caminar,
y llegó a ella a tiempo que anochecía.
Estaban acaso a la puerta dos mujeres mozas, destas que llaman del partido,
las cuales iban a Sevilla con unos arrieros que en la venta aquella noche
acertaron a hacer jornada; y, como a nuestro aventurero todo cuanto
pensaba, veía o imaginaba le parecía ser hecho y pasar al modo de lo que
había leído, luego que vio la venta, se le representó que era un castillo
con sus cuatro torres y chapiteles de luciente plata, sin faltarle su
puente levadiza y honda cava, con todos aquellos adherentes que semejantes
castillos se pintan. Fuese llegando a la venta, que a él le parecía
castillo, y a poco trecho della detuvo las riendas a Rocinante, esperando
que algún enano se pusiese entre las almenas a dar señal con alguna
trompeta de que llegaba caballero al castillo. Pero, como vio que se
tardaban y que Rocinante se daba priesa por llegar a la caballeriza, se
llegó a la puerta de la venta, y vio a las dos destraídas mozas que allí
estaban, que a él le parecieron dos hermosas doncellas o dos graciosas
damas que delante de la puerta del castillo se estaban solazando. En esto,
sucedió acaso que un porquero que andaba recogiendo de unos rastrojos una
manada de puercos —que, sin perdón, así se llaman— tocó un cuerno, a cuya
señal ellos se recogen, y al instante se le representó a don Quijote lo que
deseaba, que era que algún enano hacía señal de su venida; y así, con
estraño contento, llegó a la venta y a las damas, las cuales, como vieron
venir un hombre de aquella suerte, armado y con lanza y adarga, llenas de
miedo, se iban a entrar en la venta; pero don Quijote, coligiendo por su
huida su miedo, alzándose la visera de papelón y descubriendo su seco y
polvoroso rostro, con gentil talante y voz reposada, les dijo:
— No fuyan las vuestras mercedes ni teman desaguisado alguno; ca a la orden
de caballería que profeso non toca ni atañe facerle a ninguno, cuanto más a
tan altas doncellas como vuestras presencias demuestran.
Mirábanle las mozas, y andaban con los ojos buscándole el rostro, que la
mala visera le encubría; mas, como se oyeron llamar doncellas, cosa tan
fuera de su profesión, no pudieron tener la risa, y fue de manera que don
Quijote vino a correrse y a decirles:
— Bien parece la mesura en las fermosas, y es mucha sandez además la risa
que de leve causa procede; pero no vos lo digo porque os acuitedes ni
mostredes mal talante; que el mío non es de ál que de serviros.
El lenguaje, no entendido de las señoras, y el mal talle de nuestro
caballero acrecentaba en ellas la risa y en él el enojo; y pasara muy
adelante si a aquel punto no saliera el ventero, hombre que, por ser muy
gordo, era muy pacífico, el cual, viendo aquella figura contrahecha, armada
de armas tan desiguales como eran la brida, lanza, adarga y coselete, no
estuvo en nada en acompañar a las doncellas en las muestras de su contento.
Mas, en efeto, temiendo la máquina de tantos pertrechos, determinó de
hablarle comedidamente; y así, le dijo:
— Si vuestra merced, señor caballero, busca posada, amén del lecho (porque
en esta venta no hay ninguno), todo lo demás se hallará en ella en mucha
abundancia.
Viendo don Quijote la humildad del alcaide de la fortaleza, que tal le
pareció a él el ventero y la venta, respondió:
-Para mí, señor castellano, cualquiera cosa basta, porque
mis arreos son las armas,
mi descanso el pelear, etc.
Pensó el huésped que el haberle llamado castellano había sido por haberle
parecido de los sanos de Castilla, aunque él era andaluz, y de los de la
playa de Sanlúcar, no menos ladrón que Caco, ni menos maleante que
estudiantado paje; y así, le respondió:
— Según eso, las camas de vuestra merced serán duras peñas, y su dormir,
siempre velar; y siendo así, bien se puede apear, con seguridad de hallar
en esta choza ocasión y ocasiones para no dormir en todo un año, cuanto más
en una noche.
Y, diciendo esto, fue a tener el estribo a don Quijote, el cual se apeó con
mucha dificultad y trabajo, como aquel que en todo aquel día no se había
desayunado.
Dijo luego al huésped que le tuviese mucho cuidado de su caballo, porque
era la mejor pieza que comía pan en el mundo. Miróle el ventero, y no le
pareció tan bueno como don Quijote decía, ni aun la mitad; y, acomodándole
en la caballeriza, volvió a ver lo que su huésped mandaba, al cual estaban
desarmando las doncellas, que ya se habían reconciliado con él; las cuales,
aunque le habían quitado el peto y el espaldar, jamás supieron ni pudieron
desencajarle la gola, ni quitalle la contrahecha celada, que traía atada
con unas cintas verdes, y era menester cortarlas, por no poderse quitar los
ñudos; mas él no lo quiso consentir en ninguna manera, y así, se quedó toda
aquella noche con la celada puesta, que era la más graciosa y estraña
figura que se pudiera pensar; y, al desarmarle, como él se imaginaba que
aquellas traídas y llevadas que le desarmaban eran algunas principales
señoras y damas de aquel castillo, les dijo con mucho donaire:
-Nunca fuera caballero
de damas tan bien servido
como fuera don Quijote
cuando de su aldea vino:
doncellas curaban dél;
princesas, del su rocino,
o Rocinante, que éste es el nombre, señoras mías, de mi caballo, y don
Quijote de la Mancha el mío; que, puesto que no quisiera descubrirme fasta
que las fazañas fechas en vuestro servicio y pro me descubrieran, la fuerza
de acomodar al propósito presente este romance viejo de Lanzarote ha sido
causa que sepáis mi nombre antes de toda sazón; pero, tiempo vendrá en que
las vuestras señorías me manden y yo obedezca, y el valor de mi brazo
descubra el deseo que tengo de serviros.
Las mozas, que no estaban hechas a oír semejantes retóricas, no respondían
palabra; sólo le preguntaron si quería comer alguna cosa.
— Cualquiera yantaría yo —respondió don Quijote—, porque, a lo que entiendo,
me haría mucho al caso.
A dicha, acertó a ser viernes aquel día, y no había en toda la venta sino
unas raciones de un pescado que en Castilla llaman abadejo, y en Andalucía
bacallao, y en otras partes curadillo, y en otras truchuela. Preguntáronle
si por ventura comería su merced truchuela, que no había otro pescado que
dalle a comer.
— Como haya muchas truchuelas —respondió don Quijote—, podrán servir de una
trucha, porque eso se me da que me den ocho reales en sencillos que en una
pieza de a ocho. Cuanto más, que podría ser que fuesen estas truchuelas
como la ternera, que es mejor que la vaca, y el cabrito que el cabrón.
Pero, sea lo que fuere, venga luego, que el trabajo y peso de las armas no
se puede llevar sin el gobierno de las tripas.
Pusiéronle la mesa a la puerta de la venta, por el fresco, y trújole el
huésped una porción del mal remojado y peor cocido bacallao, y un pan tan
negro y mugriento como sus armas; pero era materia de grande risa verle
comer, porque, como tenía puesta la celada y alzada la visera, no podía
poner nada en la boca con sus manos si otro no se lo daba y ponía; y ansí,
una de aquellas señoras servía deste menester. Mas, al darle de beber, no
fue posible, ni lo fuera si el ventero no horadara una caña, y puesto el un
cabo en la boca, por el otro le iba echando el vino; y todo esto lo recebía
en paciencia, a trueco de no romper las cintas de la celada.
Estando en esto, llegó acaso a la venta un castrador de puercos; y, así
como llegó, sonó su silbato de cañas cuatro o cinco veces, con lo cual
acabó de confirmar don Quijote que estaba en algún famoso castillo, y que
le servían con música, y que el abadejo eran truchas; el pan, candeal; y
las rameras, damas; y el ventero, castellano del castillo, y con esto daba
por bien empleada su determinación y salida. Mas lo que más le fatigaba era
el no verse armado caballero, por parecerle que no se podría poner
legítimamente en aventura alguna sin recebir la orden de caballería.
Capítulo III. Donde se cuenta la graciosa manera que tuvo don Quijote en
armarse caballero
Y así, fatigado deste pensamiento, abrevió su venteril y limitada cena; la
cual acabada, llamó al ventero, y, encerrándose con él en la caballeriza,
se hincó de rodillas ante él, diciéndole:
— No me levantaré jamás de donde estoy, valeroso caballero, fasta que la
vuestra cortesía me otorgue un don que pedirle quiero, el cual redundará en
alabanza vuestra y en pro del género humano.
El ventero, que vio a su huésped a sus pies y oyó semejantes razones,
estaba confuso mirándole, sin saber qué hacerse ni decirle, y porfiaba con
él que se levantase, y jamás quiso, hasta que le hubo de decir que él le
otorgaba el don que le pedía.
— No esperaba yo menos de la gran magnificencia vuestra, señor mío
— respondió don Quijote—; y así, os digo que el don que os he pedido, y de
vuestra liberalidad me ha sido otorgado, es que mañana en aquel día me
habéis de armar caballero, y esta noche en la capilla deste vuestro
castillo velaré las armas; y mañana, como tengo dicho, se cumplirá lo que
tanto deseo, para poder, como se debe, ir por todas las cuatro partes del
mundo buscando las aventuras, en pro de los menesterosos, como está a cargo
de la caballería y de los caballeros andantes, como yo soy, cuyo deseo a
semejantes fazañas es inclinado.
El ventero, que, como está dicho, era un poco socarrón y ya tenía algunos
barruntos de la falta de juicio de su huésped, acabó de creerlo cuando
acabó de oírle semejantes razones, y, por tener qué reír aquella noche,
determinó de seguirle el humor; y así, le dijo que andaba muy acertado en
lo que deseaba y pedía, y que tal prosupuesto era propio y natural de los
caballeros tan principales como él parecía y como su gallarda presencia
mostraba; y que él, ansimesmo, en los años de su mocedad, se había dado a
aquel honroso ejercicio, andando por diversas partes del mundo buscando sus
aventuras, sin que hubiese dejado los Percheles de Málaga, Islas de Riarán,
Compás de Sevilla, Azoguejo de Segovia, la Olivera de Valencia, Rondilla de
Granada, Playa de Sanlúcar, Potro de Córdoba y las Ventillas de Toledo y
otras diversas partes, donde había ejercitado la ligereza de sus pies,
sutileza de sus manos, haciendo muchos tuertos, recuestando muchas viudas,
deshaciendo algunas doncellas y engañando a algunos pupilos, y, finalmente,
dándose a conocer por cuantas audiencias y tribunales hay casi en toda
España; y que, a lo último, se había venido a recoger a aquel su castillo,
donde vivía con su hacienda y con las ajenas, recogiendo en él a todos los
caballeros andantes, de cualquiera calidad y condición que fuesen, sólo por
la mucha afición que les tenía y porque partiesen con él de sus haberes, en
pago de su buen deseo.
Díjole también que en aquel su castillo no había capilla alguna donde poder
velar las armas, porque estaba derribada para hacerla de nuevo; pero que,
en caso de necesidad, él sabía que se podían velar dondequiera, y que
aquella noche las podría velar en un patio del castillo; que a la mañana,
siendo Dios servido, se harían las debidas ceremonias, de manera que él
quedase armado caballero, y tan caballero que no pudiese ser más en el
mundo.
Preguntóle si traía dineros; respondió don Quijote que no traía blanca,
porque él nunca había leído en las historias de los caballeros andantes que
ninguno los hubiese traído. A esto dijo el ventero que se engañaba; que,
puesto caso que en las historias no se escribía, por haberles parecido a
los autores dellas que no era menester escrebir una cosa tan clara y tan
necesaria de traerse como eran dineros y camisas limpias, no por eso se
había de creer que no los trujeron; y así, tuviese por cierto y averiguado
que todos los caballeros andantes, de que tantos libros están llenos y
atestados, llevaban bien herradas las bolsas, por lo que pudiese
sucederles; y que asimismo llevaban camisas y una arqueta pequeña llena de
ungüentos para curar las heridas que recebían, porque no todas veces en los
campos y desiertos donde se combatían y salían heridos había quien los
curase, si ya no era que tenían algún sabio encantador por amigo, que luego
los socorría, trayendo por el aire, en alguna nube, alguna doncella o enano
con alguna redoma de agua de tal virtud que, en gustando alguna gota della,
luego al punto quedaban sanos de sus llagas y heridas, como si mal alguno
hubiesen tenido. Mas que, en tanto que esto no hubiese, tuvieron los
pasados caballeros por cosa acertada que sus escuderos fuesen proveídos de
dineros y de otras cosas necesarias, como eran hilas y ungüentos para
curarse; y, cuando sucedía que los tales caballeros no tenían escuderos,
que eran pocas y raras veces, ellos mesmos lo llevaban todo en unas
alforjas muy sutiles, que casi no se parecían, a las ancas del caballo,
como que era otra cosa de más importancia; porque, no siendo por ocasión
semejante, esto de llevar alforjas no fue muy admitido entre los caballeros
andantes; y por esto le daba por consejo, pues aún se lo podía mandar como
a su ahijado, que tan presto lo había de ser, que no caminase de allí
adelante sin dineros y sin las prevenciones referidas, y que vería cuán
bien se hallaba con ellas cuando menos se pensase.
Prometióle don Quijote de hacer lo que se le aconsejaba con toda
puntualidad; y así, se dio luego orden como velase las armas en un corral
grande que a un lado de la venta estaba; y, recogiéndolas don Quijote
todas, las puso sobre una pila que junto a un pozo estaba, y, embrazando su
adarga, asió de su lanza y con gentil continente se comenzó a pasear
delante de la pila; y cuando comenzó el paseo comenzaba a cerrar la noche.
Contó el ventero a todos cuantos estaban en la venta la locura de su
huésped, la vela de las armas y la armazón de caballería que esperaba.
Admiráronse de tan estraño género de locura y fuéronselo a mirar desde
lejos, y vieron que, con sosegado ademán, unas veces se paseaba; otras,
arrimado a su lanza, ponía los ojos en las armas, sin quitarlos por un buen
espacio dellas. Acabó de cerrar la noche, pero con tanta claridad de la
luna, que podía competir con el que se la prestaba, de manera que cuanto el
novel caballero hacía era bien visto de todos. Antojósele en esto a uno de
los arrieros que estaban en la venta ir a dar agua a su recua, y fue
menester quitar las armas de don Quijote, que estaban sobre la pila; el
cual, viéndole llegar, en voz alta le dijo:
— ¡Oh tú, quienquiera que seas, atrevido caballero, que llegas a tocar las
armas del más valeroso andante que jamás se ciñó espada!, mira lo que haces
y no las toques, si no quieres dejar la vida en pago de tu atrevimiento.
No se curó el arriero destas razones (y fuera mejor que se curara, porque
fuera curarse en salud); antes, trabando de las correas, las arrojó gran
trecho de sí. Lo cual visto por don Quijote, alzó los ojos al cielo, y,
puesto el pensamiento —a lo que pareció— en su señora Dulcinea, dijo:
— Acorredme, señora mía, en esta primera afrenta que a este vuestro
avasallado pecho se le ofrece; no me desfallezca en este primero trance
vuestro favor y amparo.
Y, diciendo estas y otras semejantes razones, soltando la adarga, alzó la
lanza a dos manos y dio con ella tan gran golpe al arriero en la cabeza,
que le derribó en el suelo, tan maltrecho que, si segundara con otro, no
tuviera necesidad de maestro que le curara. Hecho esto, recogió sus armas y
tornó a pasearse con el mismo reposo que primero. Desde allí a poco, sin
saberse lo que había pasado (porque aún estaba aturdido el arriero), llegó
otro con la mesma intención de dar agua a sus mulos; y, llegando a quitar
las armas para desembarazar la pila, sin hablar don Quijote palabra y sin
pedir favor a nadie, soltó otra vez la adarga y alzó otra vez la lanza, y,
sin hacerla pedazos, hizo más de tres la cabeza del segundo arriero, porque
se la abrió por cuatro. Al ruido acudió toda la gente de la venta, y entre
ellos el ventero. Viendo esto don Quijote, embrazó su adarga, y, puesta
mano a su espada, dijo:
— ¡Oh señora de la fermosura, esfuerzo y vigor del debilitado corazón mío!
Ahora es tiempo que vuelvas los ojos de tu grandeza a este tu cautivo
caballero, que tamaña aventura está atendiendo.
Con esto cobró, a su parecer, tanto ánimo, que si le acometieran todos los
arrieros del mundo, no volviera el pie atrás. Los compañeros de los
heridos, que tales los vieron, comenzaron desde lejos a llover piedras
sobre don Quijote, el cual, lo mejor que podía, se reparaba con su adarga,
y no se osaba apartar de la pila por no desamparar las armas. El ventero
daba voces que le dejasen, porque ya les había dicho como era loco, y que
por loco se libraría, aunque los matase a todos. También don Quijote las
daba, mayores, llamándolos de alevosos y traidores, y que el señor del
castillo era un follón y mal nacido caballero, pues de tal manera consentía
que se tratasen los andantes caballeros; y que si él hubiera recebido la
orden de caballería, que él le diera a entender su alevosía:
— Pero de vosotros, soez y baja canalla, no hago caso alguno: tirad, llegad,
venid y ofendedme en cuanto pudiéredes, que vosotros veréis el pago que
lleváis de vuestra sandez y demasía.
Decía esto con tanto brío y denuedo, que infundió un terrible temor en los
que le acometían; y, así por esto como por las persuasiones del ventero, le
dejaron de tirar, y él dejó retirar a los heridos y tornó a la vela de sus
armas con la misma quietud y sosiego que primero.
No le parecieron bien al ventero las burlas de su huésped, y determinó
abreviar y darle la negra orden de caballería luego, antes que otra
desgracia sucediese. Y así, llegándose a él, se desculpó de la insolencia
que aquella gente baja con él había usado, sin que él supiese cosa alguna;
pero que bien castigados quedaban de su atrevimiento. Díjole como ya le
había dicho que en aquel castillo no había capilla, y para lo que restaba
de hacer tampoco era necesaria; que todo el toque de quedar armado
caballero consistía en la pescozada y en el espaldarazo, según él tenía
noticia del ceremonial de la orden, y que aquello en mitad de un campo se
podía hacer, y que ya había cumplido con lo que tocaba al velar de las
armas, que con solas dos horas de vela se cumplía, cuanto más, que él había
estado más de cuatro. Todo se lo creyó don Quijote, y dijo que él estaba
allí pronto para obedecerle, y que concluyese con la mayor brevedad que
pudiese; porque si fuese otra vez acometido y se viese armado caballero, no
pensaba dejar persona viva en el castillo, eceto aquellas que él le
mandase, a quien por su respeto dejaría.
Advertido y medroso desto el castellano, trujo luego un libro donde
asentaba la paja y cebada que daba a los arrieros, y con un cabo de vela
que le traía un muchacho, y con las dos ya dichas doncellas, se vino adonde
don Quijote estaba, al cual mandó hincar de rodillas; y, leyendo en su
manual, como que decía alguna devota oración, en mitad de la leyenda alzó
la mano y diole sobre el cuello un buen golpe, y tras él, con su mesma
espada, un gentil espaldazaro, siempre murmurando entre dientes, como que
rezaba. Hecho esto, mandó a una de aquellas damas que le ciñese la espada,
la cual lo hizo con mucha desenvoltura y discreción, porque no fue menester
poca para no reventar de risa a cada punto de las ceremonias; pero las
proezas que ya habían visto del novel caballero les tenía la risa a raya.
Al ceñirle la espada, dijo la buena señora:
— Dios haga a vuestra merced muy venturoso caballero y le dé ventura en
lides.
Don Quijote le preguntó cómo se llamaba, porque él supiese de allí adelante
a quién quedaba obligado por la merced recebida; porque pensaba darle
alguna parte de la honra que alcanzase por el valor de su brazo. Ella
respondió con mucha humildad que se llamaba la Tolosa, y que era hija de un
remendón natural de Toledo que vivía a las tendillas de Sancho Bienaya, y
que dondequiera que ella estuviese le serviría y le tendría por señor. Don
Quijote le replicó que, por su amor, le hiciese merced que de allí adelante
se pusiese don y se llamase doña Tolosa. Ella se lo prometió, y la otra le
calzó la espuela, con la cual le pasó casi el mismo coloquio que con la de
la espada: preguntóle su nombre, y dijo que se llamaba la Molinera, y que
era hija de un honrado molinero de Antequera; a la cual también rogó don
Quijote que se pusiese don y se llamase doña Molinera, ofreciéndole nuevos
servicios y mercedes.
Hechas, pues, de galope y aprisa las hasta allí nunca vistas ceremonias, no
vio la hora don Quijote de verse a caballo y salir buscando las aventuras;
y, ensillando luego a Rocinante, subió en él, y, abrazando a su huésped, le
dijo cosas tan estrañas, agradeciéndole la merced de haberle armado
caballero, que no es posible acertar a referirlas. El ventero, por verle ya
fuera de la venta, con no menos retóricas, aunque con más breves palabras,
respondió a las suyas, y, sin pedirle la costa de la posada, le dejó ir a
la buen hora.
Capítulo IV. De lo que le sucedió a nuestro caballero cuando salió de la
venta
La del alba sería cuando don Quijote salió de la venta, tan contento, tan
gallardo, tan alborozado por verse ya armado caballero, que el gozo le
reventaba por las cinchas del caballo. Mas, viniéndole a la memoria los
consejos de su huésped cerca de las prevenciones tan necesarias que había
de llevar consigo, especial la de los dineros y camisas, determinó volver a
su casa y acomodarse de todo, y de un escudero, haciendo cuenta de recebir
a un labrador vecino suyo, que era pobre y con hijos, pero muy a propósito
para el oficio escuderil de la caballería. Con este pensamiento guió a
Rocinante hacia su aldea, el cual, casi conociendo la querencia, con tanta
gana comenzó a caminar, que parecía que no ponía los pies en el suelo.
No había andado mucho, cuando le pareció que a su diestra mano, de la
espesura de un bosque que allí estaba, salían unas voces delicadas, como de
persona que se quejaba; y apenas las hubo oído, cuando dijo:
— Gracias doy al cielo por la merced que me hace, pues tan presto me pone
ocasiones delante donde yo pueda cumplir con lo que debo a mi profesión, y
donde pueda coger el fruto de mis buenos deseos. Estas voces, sin duda, son
de algún menesteroso o menesterosa, que ha menester mi favor y ayuda.
Y, volviendo las riendas, encaminó a Rocinante hacia donde le pareció que
las voces salían. Y, a pocos pasos que entró por el bosque, vio atada una
yegua a una encina, y atado en otra a un muchacho, desnudo de medio cuerpo
arriba, hasta de edad de quince años, que era el que las voces daba; y no
sin causa, porque le estaba dando con una pretina muchos azotes un labrador
de buen talle, y cada azote le acompañaba con una reprehensión y consejo.
Porque decía:
— La lengua queda y los ojos listos.
Y el muchacho respondía:
— No lo haré otra vez, señor mío; por la pasión de Dios, que no lo haré otra
vez; y yo prometo de tener de aquí adelante más cuidado con el hato.
Y, viendo don Quijote lo que pasaba, con voz airada dijo:
— Descortés caballero, mal parece tomaros con quien defender no se puede;
subid sobre vuestro caballo y tomad vuestra lanza —que también tenía una
lanza arrimada a la encima adonde estaba arrendada la yegua—, que yo os
haré conocer ser de cobardes lo que estáis haciendo.
El labrador, que vio sobre sí aquella figura llena de armas blandiendo la
lanza sobre su rostro, túvose por muerto, y con buenas palabras respondió:
— Señor caballero, este muchacho que estoy castigando es un mi criado, que
me sirve de guardar una manada de ovejas que tengo en estos contornos, el
cual es tan descuidado, que cada día me falta una; y, porque castigo su
descuido, o bellaquería, dice que lo hago de miserable, por no pagalle la
soldada que le debo, y en Dios y en mi ánima que miente.
— ¿"Miente", delante de mí, ruin villano? —dijo don Quijote—. Por el sol que
nos alumbra, que estoy por pasaros de parte a parte con esta lanza. Pagadle
luego sin más réplica; si no, por el Dios que nos rige, que os concluya y
aniquile en este punto. Desatadlo luego.
El labrador bajó la cabeza y, sin responder palabra, desató a su criado, al
cual preguntó don Quijote que cuánto le debía su amo. Él dijo que nueve
meses, a siete reales cada mes. Hizo la cuenta don Quijote y halló que
montaban setenta y tres reales, y díjole al labrador que al momento los
desembolsase, si no quería morir por ello. Respondió el medroso villano que
para el paso en que estaba y juramento que había hecho —y aún no había
jurado nada—, que no eran tantos, porque se le habían de descontar y
recebir en cuenta tres pares de zapatos que le había dado y un real de dos
sangrías que le habían hecho estando enfermo.
— Bien está todo eso —replicó don Quijote—, pero quédense los zapatos y las
sangrías por los azotes que sin culpa le habéis dado; que si él rompió el
cuero de los zapatos que vos pagastes, vos le habéis rompido el de su
cuerpo; y si le sacó el barbero sangre estando enfermo, vos en sanidad se
la habéis sacado; ansí que, por esta parte, no os debe nada.
— El daño está, señor caballero, en que no tengo aquí dineros: véngase
Andrés conmigo a mi casa, que yo se los pagaré un real sobre otro.
— ¿Irme yo con él? —dijo el muchacho—. Mas, ¡mal año! No, señor, ni por
pienso; porque, en viéndose solo, me desuelle como a un San Bartolomé.
— No hará tal —replicó don Quijote—: basta que yo se lo mande para que me
tenga respeto; y con que él me lo jure por la ley de caballería que ha
recebido, le dejaré ir libre y aseguraré la paga.
— Mire vuestra merced, señor, lo que dice —dijo el muchacho—, que este mi
amo no es caballero ni ha recebido orden de caballería alguna; que es Juan
Haldudo el rico, el vecino del Quintanar.
— Importa eso poco —respondió don Quijote—, que Haldudos puede haber
caballeros; cuanto más, que cada uno es hijo de sus obras.
— Así es verdad —dijo Andrés—; pero este mi amo, ¿de qué obras es hijo, pues
me niega mi soldada y mi sudor y trabajo?
— No niego, hermano Andrés —respondió el labrador—; y hacedme placer de
veniros conmigo, que yo juro por todas las órdenes que de caballerías hay
en el mundo de pagaros, como tengo dicho, un real sobre otro, y aun
sahumados.
— Del sahumerio os hago gracia —dijo don Quijote—; dádselos en reales, que
con eso me contento; y mirad que lo cumpláis como lo habéis jurado; si no,
por el mismo juramento os juro de volver a buscaros y a castigaros, y que
os tengo de hallar, aunque os escondáis más que una lagartija. Y si queréis
saber quién os manda esto, para quedar con más veras obligado a cumplirlo,
sabed que yo soy el valeroso don Quijote de la Mancha, el desfacedor de
agravios y sinrazones; y a Dios quedad, y no se os parta de las mientes lo
prometido y jurado, so pena de la pena pronunciada.
Y, en diciendo esto, picó a su Rocinante, y en breve espacio se apartó
dellos. Siguióle el labrador con los ojos, y, cuando vio que había
traspuesto del bosque y que ya no parecía, volvióse a su criado Andrés y
díjole:
— Venid acá, hijo mío, que os quiero pagar lo que os debo, como aquel
deshacedor de agravios me dejó mandado.
— Eso juro yo —dijo Andrés—; y ¡cómo que andará vuestra merced acertado en
cumplir el mandamiento de aquel buen caballero, que mil años viva; que,
según es de valeroso y de buen juez, vive Roque, que si no me paga, que
vuelva y ejecute lo que dijo!
— También lo juro yo —dijo el labrador—; pero, por lo mucho que os quiero,
quiero acrecentar la deuda por acrecentar la paga.
Y, asiéndole del brazo, le tornó a atar a la encina, donde le dio tantos
azotes, que le dejó por muerto.
— Llamad, señor Andrés, ahora —decía el labrador— al desfacedor de agravios,
veréis cómo no desface aquéste; aunque creo que no está acabado de hacer,
porque me viene gana de desollaros vivo, como vos temíades.
Pero, al fin, le desató y le dio licencia que fuese a buscar su juez, para
que ejecutase la pronunciada sentencia. Andrés se partió algo mohíno,
jurando de ir a buscar al valeroso don Quijote de la Mancha y contalle
punto por punto lo que había pasado, y que se lo había de pagar con las
setenas. Pero, con todo esto, él se partió llorando y su amo se quedó
riendo.
Y desta manera deshizo el agravio el valeroso don Quijote; el cual,
contentísimo de lo sucedido, pareciéndole que había dado felicísimo y alto
principio a sus caballerías, con gran satisfación de sí mismo iba caminando
hacia su aldea, diciendo a media voz:
— Bien te puedes llamar dichosa sobre cuantas hoy viven en la tierra, ¡oh
sobre las bellas bella Dulcinea del Toboso!, pues te cupo en suerte tener
sujeto y rendido a toda tu voluntad e talante a un tan valiente y tan
nombrado caballero como lo es y será don Quijote de la Mancha, el cual,
como todo el mundo sabe, ayer rescibió la orden de caballería, y hoy ha
desfecho el mayor tuerto y agravio que formó la sinrazón y cometió la
crueldad: hoy quitó el látigo de la mano a aquel despiadado enemigo que tan
sin ocasión vapulaba a aquel delicado infante.
En esto, llegó a un camino que en cuatro se dividía, y luego se le vino a
la imaginación las encrucejadas donde los caballeros andantes se ponían a
pensar cuál camino de aquéllos tomarían, y, por imitarlos, estuvo un rato
quedo; y, al cabo de haberlo muy bien pensado, soltó la rienda a Rocinante,
dejando a la voluntad del rocín la suya, el cual siguió su primer intento,
que fue el irse camino de su caballeriza.
Y, habiendo andado como dos millas, descubrió don Quijote un grande tropel
de gente, que, como después se supo, eran unos mercaderes toledanos que
iban a comprar seda a Murcia. Eran seis, y venían con sus quitasoles, con
otros cuatro criados a caballo y tres mozos de mulas a pie. Apenas los
divisó don Quijote, cuando se imaginó ser cosa de nueva aventura; y, por
imitar en todo cuanto a él le parecía posible los pasos que había leído en
sus libros, le pareció venir allí de molde uno que pensaba hacer. Y así,
con gentil continente y denuedo, se afirmó bien en los estribos, apretó la
lanza, llegó la adarga al pecho, y, puesto en la mitad del camino, estuvo
esperando que aquellos caballeros andantes llegasen, que ya él por tales
los tenía y juzgaba; y, cuando llegaron a trecho que se pudieron ver y oír,
levantó don Quijote la voz, y con ademán arrogante dijo:
— Todo el mundo se tenga, si todo el mundo no confiesa que no hay en el
mundo todo doncella más hermosa que la emperatriz de la Mancha, la sin par
Dulcinea del Toboso.
Paráronse los mercaderes al son destas razones, y a ver la estraña figura
del que las decía; y, por la figura y por las razones, luego echaron de ver
la locura de su dueño; mas quisieron ver despacio en qué paraba aquella
confesión que se les pedía, y uno dellos, que era un poco burlón y muy
mucho discreto, le dijo:
— Señor caballero, nosotros no conocemos quién sea esa buena señora que
decís; mostrádnosla: que si ella fuere de tanta hermosura como significáis,
de buena gana y sin apremio alguno confesaremos la verdad que por parte
vuestra nos es pedida.
— Si os la mostrara —replicó don Quijote—, ¿qué hiciérades vosotros en
confesar una verdad tan notoria? La importancia está en que sin verla lo
habéis de creer, confesar, afirmar, jurar y defender; donde no, conmigo
sois en batalla, gente descomunal y soberbia. Que, ahora vengáis uno a uno,
como pide la orden de caballería, ora todos juntos, como es costumbre y
mala usanza de los de vuestra ralea, aquí os aguardo y espero, confiado en
la razón que de mi parte tengo.
— Señor caballero —replicó el mercader—, suplico a vuestra merced, en nombre
de todos estos príncipes que aquí estamos, que, porque no encarguemos
nuestras conciencias confesando una cosa por nosotros jamás vista ni oída,
y más siendo tan en perjuicio de las emperatrices y reinas del Alcarria y
Estremadura, que vuestra merced sea servido de mostrarnos algún retrato de
esa señora, aunque sea tamaño como un grano de trigo; que por el hilo se
sacará el ovillo, y quedaremos con esto satisfechos y seguros, y vuestra
merced quedará contento y pagado; y aun creo que estamos ya tan de su parte
que, aunque su retrato nos muestre que es tuerta de un ojo y que del otro
le mana bermellón y piedra azufre, con todo eso, por complacer a vuestra
merced, diremos en su favor todo lo que quisiere.
— No le mana, canalla infame —respondió don Quijote, encendido en cólera—;
no le mana, digo, eso que decís, sino ámbar y algalia entre algodones; y no
es tuerta ni corcovada, sino más derecha que un huso de Guadarrama. Pero
vosotros pagaréis la grande blasfemia que habéis dicho contra tamaña beldad
como es la de mi señora.
Y, en diciendo esto, arremetió con la lanza baja contra el que lo había
dicho, con tanta furia y enojo que, si la buena suerte no hiciera que en la
mitad del camino tropezara y cayera Rocinante, lo pasara mal el atrevido
mercader. Cayó Rocinante, y fue rodando su amo una buena pieza por el
campo; y, queriéndose levantar, jamás pudo: tal embarazo le causaban la
lanza, adarga, espuelas y celada, con el peso de las antiguas armas. Y,
entretanto que pugnaba por levantarse y no podía, estaba diciendo:
— ¡Non fuyáis, gente cobarde; gente cautiva, atended!; que no por culpa mía,
sino de mi caballo, estoy aquí tendido.
Un mozo de mulas de los que allí venían, que no debía de ser muy bien
intencionado, oyendo decir al pobre caído tantas arrogancias, no lo pudo
sufrir sin darle la respuesta en las costillas. Y, llegándose a él, tomó la
lanza, y, después de haberla hecho pedazos, con uno dellos comenzó a dar a
nuestro don Quijote tantos palos que, a despecho y pesar de sus armas, le
molió como cibera. Dábanle voces sus amos que no le diese tanto y que le
dejase, pero estaba ya el mozo picado y no quiso dejar el juego hasta
envidar todo el resto de su cólera; y, acudiendo por los demás trozos de la
lanza, los acabó de deshacer sobre el miserable caído, que, con toda
aquella tempestad de palos que sobre él vía, no cerraba la boca, amenazando
al cielo y a la tierra, y a los malandrines, que tal le parecían.
Cansóse el mozo, y los mercaderes siguieron su camino, llevando qué contar
en todo él del pobre apaleado. El cual, después que se vio solo, tornó a
probar si podía levantarse; pero si no lo pudo hacer cuando sano y bueno,
¿cómo lo haría molido y casi deshecho? Y aún se tenía por dichoso,
pareciéndole que aquélla era propia desgracia de caballeros andantes, y
toda la atribuía a la falta de su caballo, y no era posible levantarse,
según tenía brumado todo el cuerpo.
Capítulo V. Donde se prosigue la narración de la desgracia de nuestro
caballero
Viendo, pues, que, en efeto, no podía menearse, acordó de acogerse a su
ordinario remedio, que era pensar en algún paso de sus libros; y trújole su
locura a la memoria aquel de Valdovinos y del marqués de Mantua, cuando
Carloto le dejó herido en la montiña, historia sabida de los niños, no
ignorada de los mozos, celebrada y aun creída de los viejos; y, con todo
esto, no más verdadera que los milagros de Mahoma. Ésta, pues, le pareció a
él que le venía de molde para el paso en que se hallaba; y así, con
muestras de grande sentimiento, se comenzó a volcar por la tierra y a decir
con debilitado aliento lo mesmo que dicen decía el herido caballero del
bosque:
-¿Donde estás, señora mía,
que no te duele mi mal?
O no lo sabes, señora,
o eres falsa y desleal.
Y, desta manera, fue prosiguiendo el romance hasta aquellos versos que
dicen:
-¡Oh noble marqués de Mantua,
mi tío y señor carnal!
Y quiso la suerte que, cuando llegó a este verso, acertó a pasar por allí
un labrador de su mesmo lugar y vecino suyo, que venía de llevar una carga
de trigo al molino; el cual, viendo aquel hombre allí tendido, se llegó a
él y le preguntó que quién era y qué mal sentía que tan tristemente se
quejaba. Don Quijote creyó, sin duda, que aquél era el marqués de Mantua,
su tío; y así, no le respondió otra cosa si no fue proseguir en su romance,
donde le daba cuenta de su desgracia y de los amores del hijo del Emperante
con su esposa, todo de la mesma manera que el romance lo canta.
El labrador estaba admirado oyendo aquellos disparates; y, quitándole la
visera, que ya estaba hecha pedazos de los palos, le limpió el rostro, que
le tenía cubierto de polvo; y apenas le hubo limpiado, cuando le conoció y
le dijo:
— Señor Quijana —que así se debía de llamar cuando él tenía juicio y no
había pasado de hidalgo sosegado a caballero andante—, ¿quién ha puesto a
vuestra merced desta suerte?
Pero él seguía con su romance a cuanto le preguntaba. Viendo esto el buen
hombre, lo mejor que pudo le quitó el peto y espaldar, para ver si tenía
alguna herida; pero no vio sangre ni señal alguna. Procuró levantarle del
suelo, y no con poco trabajo le subió sobre su jumento, por parecer
caballería más sosegada. Recogió las armas, hasta las astillas de la lanza,
y liólas sobre Rocinante, al cual tomó de la rienda, y del cabestro al
asno, y se encaminó hacia su pueblo, bien pensativo de oír los disparates
que don Quijote decía; y no menos iba don Quijote, que, de puro molido y
quebrantado, no se podía tener sobre el borrico, y de cuando en cuando daba
unos suspiros que los ponía en el cielo; de modo que de nuevo obligó a que
el labrador le preguntase le dijese qué mal sentía; y no parece sino que el
diablo le traía a la memoria los cuentos acomodados a sus sucesos, porque,
en aquel punto, olvidándose de Valdovinos, se acordó del moro Abindarráez,
cuando el alcaide de Antequera, Rodrigo de Narváez, le prendió y llevó
cautivo a su alcaidía. De suerte que, cuando el labrador le volvió a
preguntar que cómo estaba y qué sentía, le respondió las mesmas palabras y
razones que el cautivo Abencerraje respondía a Rodrigo de Narváez, del
mesmo modo que él había leído la historia en La Diana, de Jorge de
Montemayor, donde se escribe; aprovechándose della tan a propósito, que el
labrador se iba dando al diablo de oír tanta máquina de necedades; por
donde conoció que su vecino estaba loco, y dábale priesa a llegar al
pueblo, por escusar el enfado que don Quijote le causaba con su larga
arenga. Al cabo de lo cual, dijo:
— Sepa vuestra merced, señor don Rodrigo de Narváez, que esta hermosa Jarifa
que he dicho es ahora la linda Dulcinea del Toboso, por quien yo he hecho,
hago y haré los más famosos hechos de caballerías que se han visto, vean ni
verán en el mundo.
A esto respondió el labrador:
— Mire vuestra merced, señor, pecador de mí, que yo no soy don Rodrigo de
Narváez, ni el marqués de Mantua, sino Pedro Alonso, su vecino; ni vuestra
merced es Valdovinos, ni Abindarráez, sino el honrado hidalgo del señor
Quijana.
— Yo sé quién soy —respondió don Quijote—; y sé que puedo ser no sólo los
que he dicho, sino todos los Doce Pares de Francia, y aun todos los Nueve
de la Fama, pues a todas las hazañas que ellos todos juntos y cada uno por
sí hicieron, se aventajarán las mías.
En estas pláticas y en otras semejantes, llegaron al lugar a la hora que
anochecía, pero el labrador aguardó a que fuese algo más noche, porque no
viesen al molido hidalgo tan mal caballero. Llegada, pues, la hora que le
pareció, entró en el pueblo, y en la casa de don Quijote, la cual halló
toda alborotada; y estaban en ella el cura y el barbero del lugar, que eran
grandes amigos de don Quijote, que estaba diciéndoles su ama a voces:
— ¿Qué le parece a vuestra merced, señor licenciado Pero Pérez —que así se
llamaba el cura—, de la desgracia de mi señor? Tres días ha que no parecen
él, ni el rocín, ni la adarga, ni la lanza ni las armas. ¡Desventurada de
mí!, que me doy a entender, y así es ello la verdad como nací para morir,
que estos malditos libros de caballerías que él tiene y suele leer tan de
ordinario le han vuelto el juicio; que ahora me acuerdo haberle oído decir
muchas veces, hablando entre sí, que quería hacerse caballero andante e
irse a buscar las aventuras por esos mundos. Encomendados sean a Satanás y
a Barrabás tales libros, que así han echado a perder el más delicado
entendimiento que había en toda la Mancha.
La sobrina decía lo mesmo, y aun decía más:
— Sepa, señor maese Nicolás —que éste era el nombre del barbero—, que muchas
veces le aconteció a mi señor tío estarse leyendo en estos desalmados
libros de desventuras dos días con sus noches, al cabo de los cuales,
arrojaba el libro de las manos, y ponía mano a la espada y andaba a
cuchilladas con las paredes; y cuando estaba muy cansado, decía que había
muerto a cuatro gigantes como cuatro torres, y el sudor que sudaba del
cansancio decía que era sangre de las feridas que había recebido en la
batalla; y bebíase luego un gran jarro de agua fría, y quedaba sano y
sosegado, diciendo que aquella agua era una preciosísima bebida que le
había traído el sabio Esquife, un grande encantador y amigo suyo. Mas yo me
tengo la culpa de todo, que no avisé a vuestras mercedes de los disparates
de mi señor tío, para que lo remediaran antes de llegar a lo que ha
llegado, y quemaran todos estos descomulgados libros, que tiene muchos, que
bien merecen ser abrasados, como si fuesen de herejes.
— Esto digo yo también —dijo el cura—, y a fee que no se pase el día de
mañana sin que dellos no se haga acto público y sean condenados al fuego,
porque no den ocasión a quien los leyere de hacer lo que mi buen amigo debe
de haber hecho.
Todo esto estaban oyendo el labrador y don Quijote, con que acabó de
entender el labrador la enfermedad de su vecino; y así, comenzó a decir a
voces:
— Abran vuestras mercedes al señor Valdovinos y al señor marqués de Mantua,
que viene malferido, y al señor moro Abindarráez, que trae cautivo el
valeroso Rodrigo de Narváez, alcaide de Antequera.
A estas voces salieron todos, y, como conocieron los unos a su amigo, las
otras a su amo y tío, que aún no se había apeado del jumento, porque no
podía, corrieron a abrazarle. Él dijo:
— Ténganse todos, que vengo malferido por la culpa de mi caballo. Llévenme a
mi lecho y llámese, si fuere posible, a la sabia Urganda, que cure y cate
de mis feridas.
— ¡Mirá, en hora maza —dijo a este punto el ama—, si me decía a mí bien mi
corazón del pie que cojeaba mi señor! Suba vuestra merced en buen hora,
que, sin que venga esa Hurgada, le sabremos aquí curar. ¡Malditos, digo,
sean otra vez y otras ciento estos libros de caballerías, que tal han
parado a vuestra merced!
Lleváronle luego a la cama, y, catándole las feridas, no le hallaron
ninguna; y él dijo que todo era molimiento, por haber dado una gran caída
con Rocinante, su caballo, combatiéndose con diez jayanes, los más
desaforados y atrevidos que se pudieran fallar en gran parte de la tierra.
— ¡Ta, ta! —dijo el cura—. ¿Jayanes hay en la danza? Para mi santiguada, que
yo los queme mañana antes que llegue la noche.
Hiciéronle a don Quijote mil preguntas, y a ninguna quiso responder otra
cosa sino que le diesen de comer y le dejasen dormir, que era lo que más le
importaba. Hízose así, y el cura se informó muy a la larga del labrador del
modo que había hallado a don Quijote. Él se lo contó todo, con los
disparates que al hallarle y al traerle había dicho; que fue poner más
deseo en el licenciado de hacer lo que otro día hizo, que fue llamar a su
amigo el barbero maese Nicolás, con el cual se vino a casa de don Quijote,
Capítulo VI. Del donoso y grande escrutinio que el cura y el barbero
hicieron en la librería de nuestro ingenioso hidalgo
el cual aún todavía dormía. Pidió las llaves, a la sobrina, del aposento
donde estaban los libros, autores del daño, y ella se las dio de muy buena
gana. Entraron dentro todos, y la ama con ellos, y hallaron más de cien
cuerpos de libros grandes, muy bien encuadernados, y otros pequeños; y, así
como el ama los vio, volvióse a salir del aposento con gran priesa, y tornó
luego con una escudilla de agua bendita y un hisopo, y dijo:
— Tome vuestra merced, señor licenciado: rocíe este aposento, no esté aquí
algún encantador de los muchos que tienen estos libros, y nos encanten, en
pena de las que les queremos dar echándolos del mundo.
Causó risa al licenciado la simplicidad del ama, y mandó al barbero que le
fuese dando de aquellos libros uno a uno, para ver de qué trataban, pues
podía ser hallar algunos que no mereciesen castigo de fuego.
— No —dijo la sobrina—, no hay para qué perdonar a ninguno, porque todos han
sido los dañadores; mejor será arrojarlos por las ventanas al patio, y
hacer un rimero dellos y pegarles fuego; y si no, llevarlos al corral, y
allí se hará la hoguera, y no ofenderá el humo.
Lo mismo dijo el ama: tal era la gana que las dos tenían de la muerte de
aquellos inocentes; mas el cura no vino en ello sin primero leer siquiera
los títulos. Y el primero que maese Nicolás le dio en las manos fue Los
cuatro de Amadís de Gaula, y dijo el cura:
— Parece cosa de misterio ésta; porque, según he oído decir, este libro fue
el primero de caballerías que se imprimió en España, y todos los demás han
tomado principio y origen déste; y así, me parece que, como a dogmatizador
de una secta tan mala, le debemos, sin escusa alguna, condenar al fuego.
— No, señor —dijo el barbero—, que también he oído decir que es el mejor de
todos los libros que de este género se han compuesto; y así, como a único
en su arte, se debe perdonar.
— Así es verdad —dijo el cura—, y por esa razón se le otorga la vida por
ahora. Veamos esotro que está junto a él.
— Es —dijo el barbero— las Sergas de Esplandián, hijo legítimo de Amadís de
Gaula.
— Pues, en verdad —dijo el cura— que no le ha de valer al hijo la bondad del
padre. Tomad, señora ama: abrid esa ventana y echadle al corral, y dé
principio al montón de la hoguera que se ha de hacer.
Hízolo así el ama con mucho contento, y el bueno de Esplandián fue volando
al corral, esperando con toda paciencia el fuego que le amenazaba.
— Adelante —dijo el cura.
— Este que viene —dijo el barbero— es Amadís de Grecia; y aun todos los
deste lado, a lo que creo, son del mesmo linaje de Amadís.
— Pues vayan todos al corral —dijo el cura—; que, a trueco de quemar a la
reina Pintiquiniestra, y al pastor Darinel, y a sus églogas, y a las
endiabladas y revueltas razones de su autor, quemaré con ellos al padre que
me engendró, si anduviera en figura de caballero andante.
— De ese parecer soy yo —dijo el barbero.
— Y aun yo —añadió la sobrina.
— Pues así es —dijo el ama—, vengan, y al corral con ellos.
Diéronselos, que eran muchos, y ella ahorró la escalera y dio con ellos por
la ventana abajo.
— ¿Quién es ese tonel? —dijo el cura.
— Éste es —respondió el barbero— Don Olivante de Laura.
— El autor de ese libro —dijo el cura— fue el mesmo que compuso a Jardín de
flores; y en verdad que no sepa determinar cuál de los dos libros es más
verdadero, o, por decir mejor, menos mentiroso; sólo sé decir que éste irá
al corral por disparatado y arrogante.
— Éste que se sigue es Florimorte de Hircania —dijo el barbero.
— ¿Ahí está el señor Florimorte? —replicó el cura—. Pues a fe que ha de
parar presto en el corral, a pesar de su estraño nacimiento y sonadas
aventuras; que no da lugar a otra cosa la dureza y sequedad de su estilo.
Al corral con él y con esotro, señora ama.
— Que me place, señor mío —respondía ella; y con mucha alegría ejecutaba lo
que le era mandado.
— Éste es El Caballero Platir —dijo el barbero.
— Antiguo libro es éste —dijo el cura—, y no hallo en él cosa que merezca
venia. Acompañe a los demás sin réplica.
Y así fue hecho. Abrióse otro libro y vieron que tenía por título El
Caballero de la Cruz.
— Por nombre tan santo como este libro tiene, se podía perdonar su
ignorancia; mas también se suele decir: "tras la cruz está el diablo"; vaya
al fuego.
Tomando el barbero otro libro, dijo:
— Éste es Espejo de caballerías.
— Ya conozco a su merced —dijo el cura—. Ahí anda el señor Reinaldos de
Montalbán con sus amigos y compañeros, más ladrones que Caco, y los doce
Pares, con el verdadero historiador Turpín; y en verdad que estoy por
condenarlos no más que a destierro perpetuo, siquiera porque tienen parte
de la invención del famoso Mateo Boyardo, de donde también tejió su tela el
cristiano poeta Ludovico Ariosto; al cual, si aquí le hallo, y que habla en
otra lengua que la suya, no le guardaré respeto alguno; pero si habla en su
idioma, le pondré sobre mi cabeza.
— Pues yo le tengo en italiano —dijo el barbero—, mas no le entiendo.
— Ni aun fuera bien que vos le entendiérades —respondió el cura—, y aquí le
perdonáramos al señor capitán que no le hubiera traído a España y hecho
castellano; que le quitó mucho de su natural valor, y lo mesmo harán todos
aquellos que los libros de verso quisieren volver en otra lengua: que, por
mucho cuidado que pongan y habilidad que muestren, jamás llegarán al punto
que ellos tienen en su primer nacimiento. Digo, en efeto, que este libro, y
todos los que se hallaren que tratan destas cosas de Francia, se echen y
depositen en un pozo seco, hasta que con más acuerdo se vea lo que se ha de
hacer dellos, ecetuando a un Bernardo del Carpio que anda por ahí y a otro
llamado Roncesvalles; que éstos, en llegando a mis manos, han de estar en
las del ama, y dellas en las del fuego, sin remisión alguna.
Todo lo confirmó el barbero, y lo tuvo por bien y por cosa muy acertada,
por entender que era el cura tan buen cristiano y tan amigo de la verdad,
que no diría otra cosa por todas las del mundo. Y, abriendo otro libro, vio
que era Palmerín de Oliva, y junto a él estaba otro que se llamaba Palmerín
de Ingalaterra; lo cual visto por el licenciado, dijo:
— Esa oliva se haga luego rajas y se queme, que aun no queden della las
cenizas; y esa palma de Ingalaterra se guarde y se conserve como a cosa
única, y se haga para ello otra caja como la que halló Alejandro en los
despojos de Dario, que la diputó para guardar en ella las obras del poeta
Homero. Este libro, señor compadre, tiene autoridad por dos cosas: la una,
porque él por sí es muy bueno, y la otra, porque es fama que le compuso un
discreto rey de Portugal. Todas las aventuras del castillo de Miraguarda
son bonísimas y de grande artificio; las razones, cortesanas y claras, que
guardan y miran el decoro del que habla con mucha propriedad y
entendimiento. Digo, pues, salvo vuestro buen parecer, señor maese Nicolás,
que éste y Amadís de Gaula queden libres del fuego, y todos los demás, sin
hacer más cala y cata, perezcan.
— No, señor compadre —replicó el barbero—; que éste que aquí tengo es el
afamado Don Belianís.
— Pues ése —replicó el cura—, con la segunda, tercera y cuarta parte, tienen
necesidad de un poco de ruibarbo para purgar la demasiada cólera suya, y es
menester quitarles todo aquello del castillo de la Fama y otras
impertinencias de más importancia, para lo cual se les da término
ultramarino, y como se enmendaren, así se usará con ellos de misericordia o
de justicia; y en tanto, tenedlos vos, compadre, en vuestra casa, mas no
los dejéis leer a ninguno.
— Que me place —respondió el barbero.
Y, sin querer cansarse más en leer libros de caballerías, mandó al ama que
tomase todos los grandes y diese con ellos en el corral. No se dijo a tonta
ni a sorda, sino a quien tenía más gana de quemallos que de echar una tela,
por grande y delgada que fuera; y, asiendo casi ocho de una vez, los arrojó
por la ventana. Por tomar muchos juntos, se le cayó uno a los pies del
barbero, que le tomó gana de ver de quién era, y vio que decía: Historia
del famoso caballero Tirante el Blanco.
— ¡Válame Dios! —dijo el cura, dando una gran voz—. ¡Que aquí esté Tirante
el Blanco! Dádmele acá, compadre; que hago cuenta que he hallado en él un
tesoro de contento y una mina de pasatiempos. Aquí está don Quirieleisón de
Montalbán, valeroso caballero, y su hermano Tomás de Montalbán, y el
caballero Fonseca, con la batalla que el valiente de Tirante hizo con el
alano, y las agudezas de la doncella Placerdemivida, con los amores y
embustes de la viuda Reposada, y la señora Emperatriz, enamorada de
Hipólito, su escudero. Dígoos verdad, señor compadre, que, por su estilo,
es éste el mejor libro del mundo: aquí comen los caballeros, y duermen, y
mueren en sus camas, y hacen testamento antes de su muerte, con estas cosas
de que todos los demás libros deste género carecen. Con todo eso, os digo
que merecía el que le compuso, pues no hizo tantas necedades de industria,
que le echaran a galeras por todos los días de su vida. Llevadle a casa y
leedle, y veréis que es verdad cuanto dél os he dicho.
— Así será —respondió el barbero—; pero, ¿qué haremos destos pequeños libros
que quedan?
— Éstos —dijo el cura— no deben de ser de caballerías, sino de poesía.
Y abriendo uno, vio que era La Diana, de Jorge de Montemayor, y dijo,
creyendo que todos los demás eran del mesmo género:
— Éstos no merecen ser quemados, como los demás, porque no hacen ni harán el
daño que los de caballerías han hecho; que son libros de entendimiento, sin
perjuicio de tercero.
— ¡Ay señor! —dijo la sobrina—, bien los puede vuestra merced mandar quemar,
como a los demás, porque no sería mucho que, habiendo sanado mi señor tío
de la enfermedad caballeresca, leyendo éstos, se le antojase de hacerse
pastor y andarse por los bosques y prados cantando y tañendo; y, lo que
sería peor, hacerse poeta; que, según dicen, es enfermedad incurable y
pegadiza.
— Verdad dice esta doncella —dijo el cura—, y será bien quitarle a nuestro
amigo este tropiezo y ocasión delante. Y, pues comenzamos por La Diana de
Montemayor, soy de parecer que no se queme, sino que se le quite todo
aquello que trata de la sabia Felicia y de la agua encantada, y casi todos
los versos mayores, y quédesele en hora buena la prosa, y la honra de ser
primero en semejantes libros.
— Éste que se sigue —dijo el barbero— es La Diana llamada segunda del
Salmantino; y éste, otro que tiene el mesmo nombre, cuyo autor es Gil Polo.
— Pues la del Salmantino —respondió el cura—, acompañe y acreciente el
número de los condenados al corral, y la de Gil Polo se guarde como si
fuera del mesmo Apolo; y pase adelante, señor compadre, y démonos prisa,
que se va haciendo tarde.
— Este libro es —dijo el barbero, abriendo otro— Los diez libros de Fortuna
de Amor, compuestos por Antonio de Lofraso, poeta sardo.
— Por las órdenes que recebí —dijo el cura—, que, desde que Apolo fue Apolo,
y las musas musas, y los poetas poetas, tan gracioso ni tan disparatado
libro como ése no se ha compuesto, y que, por su camino, es el mejor y el
más único de cuantos deste género han salido a la luz del mundo; y el que
no le ha leído puede hacer cuenta que no ha leído jamás cosa de gusto.
Dádmele acá, compadre, que precio más haberle hallado que si me dieran una
sotana de raja de Florencia.
Púsole aparte con grandísimo gusto, y el barbero prosiguió diciendo:
— Estos que se siguen son El Pastor de Iberia, Ninfas de Henares y
Desengaños de celos.
— Pues no hay más que hacer —dijo el cura—, sino entregarlos al brazo seglar
del ama; y no se me pregunte el porqué, que sería nunca acabar.
— Este que viene es El Pastor de Fílida.
— No es ése pastor —dijo el cura—, sino muy discreto cortesano; guárdese
como joya preciosa.
— Este grande que aquí viene se intitula —dijo el barbero— Tesoro de varias
poesías.
— Como ellas no fueran tantas —dijo el cura—, fueran más estimadas; menester
es que este libro se escarde y limpie de algunas bajezas que entre sus
grandezas tiene. Guárdese, porque su autor es amigo mío, y por respeto de
otras más heroicas y levantadas obras que ha escrito.
— Éste es —siguió el barbero— El Cancionero de López Maldonado.
— También el autor de ese libro —replicó el cura— es grande amigo mío, y sus
versos en su boca admiran a quien los oye; y tal es la suavidad de la voz
con que los canta, que encanta. Algo largo es en las églogas, pero nunca lo
bueno fue mucho: guárdese con los escogidos. Pero, ¿qué libro es ese que
está junto a él?
— La Galatea, de Miguel de Cervantes —dijo el barbero.
— Muchos años ha que es grande amigo mío ese Cervantes, y sé que es más
versado en desdichas que en versos. Su libro tiene algo de buena invención;
propone algo, y no concluye nada: es menester esperar la segunda parte que
promete; quizá con la emienda alcanzará del todo la misericordia que ahora
se le niega; y, entre tanto que esto se ve, tenedle recluso en vuestra
posada, señor compadre.
— Que me place —respondió el barbero—. Y aquí vienen tres, todos juntos: La
Araucana, de don Alonso de Ercilla; La Austríada, de Juan Rufo, jurado de
Córdoba, y El Monserrato, de Cristóbal de Virués, poeta valenciano.
— Todos esos tres libros —dijo el cura— son los mejores que, en verso
heroico, en lengua castellana están escritos, y pueden competir con los más
famosos de Italia: guárdense como las más ricas prendas de poesía que tiene
España.
Cansóse el cura de ver más libros; y así, a carga cerrada, quiso que todos
los demás se quemasen; pero ya tenía abierto uno el barbero, que se llamaba
Las lágrimas de Angélica.
— Lloráralas yo —dijo el cura en oyendo el nombre— si tal libro hubiera
mandado quemar; porque su autor fue uno de los famosos poetas del mundo, no
sólo de España, y fue felicísimo en la tradución de algunas fábulas de
Ovidio.
Capítulo VII. De la segunda salida de nuestro buen caballero don Quijote de
la Mancha
Estando en esto, comenzó a dar voces don Quijote, diciendo:
— Aquí, aquí, valerosos caballeros; aquí es menester mostrar la fuerza de
vuestros valerosos brazos, que los cortesanos llevan lo mejor del torneo.
Por acudir a este ruido y estruendo, no se pasó adelante con el escrutinio
de los demás libros que quedaban; y así, se cree que fueron al fuego, sin
ser vistos ni oídos, La Carolea y León de España, con Los Hechos del
Emperador, compuestos por don Luis de Ávila, que, sin duda, debían de estar
entre los que quedaban; y quizá, si el cura los viera, no pasaran por tan
rigurosa sentencia.
Cuando llegaron a don Quijote, ya él estaba levantado de la cama, y
proseguía en sus voces y en sus desatinos, dando cuchilladas y reveses a
todas partes, estando tan despierto como si nunca hubiera dormido.
Abrazáronse con él, y por fuerza le volvieron al lecho; y, después que hubo
sosegado un poco, volviéndose a hablar con el cura, le dijo:
— Por cierto, señor arzobispo Turpín, que es gran mengua de los que nos
llamamos doce Pares dejar, tan sin más ni más, llevar la vitoria deste
torneo a los caballeros cortesanos, habiendo nosotros los aventureros
ganado el prez en los tres días antecedentes.
— Calle vuestra merced, señor compadre —dijo el cura—, que Dios será servido
que la suerte se mude, y que lo que hoy se pierde se gane mañana; y atienda
vuestra merced a su salud por agora, que me parece que debe de estar
demasiadamente cansado, si ya no es que está malferido.
— Ferido no —dijo don Quijote—, pero molido y quebrantado, no hay duda en
ello; porque aquel bastardo de don Roldán me ha molido a palos con el
tronco de una encina, y todo de envidia, porque ve que yo solo soy el
opuesto de sus valentías. Mas no me llamaría yo Reinaldos de Montalbán si,
en levantándome deste lecho, no me lo pagare, a pesar de todos sus
encantamentos; y, por agora, tráiganme de yantar, que sé que es lo que más
me hará al caso, y quédese lo del vengarme a mi cargo.
Hiciéronlo ansí: diéronle de comer, y quedóse otra vez dormido, y ellos,
admirados de su locura.
Aquella noche quemó y abrasó el ama cuantos libros había en el corral y en
toda la casa, y tales debieron de arder que merecían guardarse en perpetuos
archivos; mas no lo permitió su suerte y la pereza del escrutiñador; y así,
se cumplió el refrán en ellos de que pagan a las veces justos por
pecadores.
Uno de los remedios que el cura y el barbero dieron, por entonces, para el
mal de su amigo, fue que le murasen y tapiasen el aposento de los libros,
porque cuando se levantase no los hallase —quizá quitando la causa, cesaría
el efeto—, y que dijesen que un encantador se los había llevado, y el
aposento y todo; y así fue hecho con mucha presteza. De allí a dos días se
levantó don Quijote, y lo primero que hizo fue ir a
ver sus libros; y, como no hallaba el aposento donde le había dejado,
andaba de una en otra parte buscándole. Llegaba adonde solía tener la
puerta, y tentábala con las manos, y volvía y revolvía los ojos por todo,
sin decir palabra; pero, al cabo de una buena pieza, preguntó a su ama que
hacia qué parte estaba el aposento de sus libros. El ama, que ya estaba
bien advertida de lo que había de responder, le dijo:
— ¿Qué aposento, o qué nada, busca vuestra merced? Ya no hay aposento ni
libros en esta casa, porque todo se lo llevó el mesmo diablo.
— No era diablo —replicó la sobrina—, sino un encantador que vino sobre una
nube una noche, después del día que vuestra merced de aquí se partió, y,
apeándose de una sierpe en que venía caballero, entró en el aposento, y no
sé lo que se hizo dentro, que a cabo de poca pieza salió volando por el
tejado, y dejó la casa llena de humo; y, cuando acordamos a mirar lo que
dejaba hecho, no vimos libro ni aposento alguno; sólo se nos acuerda muy
bien a mí y al ama que, al tiempo del partirse aquel mal viejo, dijo en
altas voces que, por enemistad secreta que tenía al dueño de aquellos
libros y aposento, dejaba hecho el daño en aquella casa que después se
vería. Dijo también que se llamaba el sabio Muñatón.
— Frestón diría —dijo don Quijote.
— No sé —respondió el ama— si se llamaba Frestón o Fritón; sólo sé que acabó
en tón su nombre.
— Así es —dijo don Quijote—; que ése es un sabio encantador, grande enemigo
mío, que me tiene ojeriza, porque sabe por sus artes y letras que tengo de
venir, andando los tiempos, a pelear en singular batalla con un caballero a
quien él favorece, y le tengo de vencer, sin que él lo pueda estorbar, y
por esto procura hacerme todos los sinsabores que puede; y mándole yo que
mal podrá él contradecir ni evitar lo que por el cielo está ordenado.
— ¿Quién duda de eso? —dijo la sobrina—. Pero, ¿quién le mete a vuestra
merced, señor tío, en esas pendencias? ¿No será mejor estarse pacífico en
su casa y no irse por el mundo a buscar pan de trastrigo, sin considerar
que muchos van por lana y vuelven tresquilados?
— ¡Oh sobrina mía —respondió don Quijote—, y cuán mal que estás en la
cuenta! Primero que a mí me tresquilen, tendré peladas y quitadas las
barbas a cuantos imaginaren tocarme en la punta de un solo cabello.
No quisieron las dos replicarle más, porque vieron que se le encendía la
cólera.
Es, pues, el caso que él estuvo quince días en casa muy sosegado, sin dar
muestras de querer segundar sus primeros devaneos, en los cuales días pasó
graciosísimos cuentos con sus dos compadres el cura y el barbero, sobre que
él decía que la cosa de que más necesidad tenía el mundo era de caballeros
andantes y de que en él se resucitase la caballería andantesca. El cura
algunas veces le contradecía y otras concedía, porque si no guardaba este
artificio, no había poder averiguarse con él.
En este tiempo, solicitó don Quijote a un labrador vecino suyo, hombre de
bien —si es que este título se puede dar al que es pobre—, pero de muy poca
sal en la mollera. En resolución, tanto le dijo, tanto le persuadió y
prometió, que el pobre villano se determinó de salirse con él y servirle de
escudero. Decíale, entre otras cosas, don Quijote que se dispusiese a ir
con él de buena gana, porque tal vez le podía suceder aventura que ganase,
en quítame allá esas pajas, alguna ínsula, y le dejase a él por gobernador
della. Con estas promesas y otras tales, Sancho Panza, que así se llamaba
el labrador, dejó su mujer y hijos y asentó por escudero de su vecino.
Dio luego don Quijote orden en buscar dineros; y, vendiendo una cosa y
empeñando otra, y malbaratándolas todas, llegó una razonable cantidad.
Acomodóse asimesmo de una rodela, que pidió prestada a un su amigo, y,
pertrechando su rota celada lo mejor que pudo, avisó a su escudero Sancho
del día y la hora que pensaba ponerse en camino, para que él se acomodase
de lo que viese que más le era menester. Sobre todo le encargó que llevase
alforjas; e dijo que sí llevaría, y que ansimesmo pensaba llevar un asno
que tenía muy bueno, porque él no estaba duecho a andar mucho a pie. En lo
del asno reparó un poco don Quijote, imaginando si se le acordaba si algún
caballero andante había traído escudero caballero asnalmente, pero nunca le
vino alguno a la memoria; mas, con todo esto, determinó que le llevase, con
presupuesto de acomodarle de más honrada caballería en habiendo ocasión
para ello, quitándole el caballo al primer descortés caballero que topase.
Proveyóse de camisas y de las demás cosas que él pudo, conforme al consejo
que el ventero le había dado; todo lo cual hecho y cumplido, sin despedirse
Panza de sus hijos y mujer, ni don Quijote de su ama y sobrina, una noche
se salieron del lugar sin que persona los viese; en la cual caminaron
tanto, que al amanecer se tuvieron por seguros de que no los hallarían
aunque los buscasen.
Iba Sancho Panza sobre su jumento como un patriarca, con sus alforjas y su
bota, y con mucho deseo de verse ya gobernador de la ínsula que su amo le
había prometido. Acertó don Quijote a tomar la misma derrota y camino que
el que él había tomado en su primer viaje, que fue por el campo de Montiel,
por el cual caminaba con menos pesadumbre que la vez pasada, porque, por
ser la hora de la mañana y herirles a soslayo los rayos del sol, no les
fatigaban. Dijo en esto Sancho Panza a su amo:
— Mire vuestra merced, señor caballero andante, que no se le olvide lo que
de la ínsula me tiene prometido; que yo la sabré gobernar, por grande que
sea.
A lo cual le respondió don Quijote:
— Has de saber, amigo Sancho Panza, que fue costumbre muy usada de los
caballeros andantes antiguos hacer gobernadores a sus escuderos de las
ínsulas o reinos que ganaban, y yo tengo determinado de que por mí no falte
tan agradecida usanza; antes, pienso aventajarme en ella: porque ellos
algunas veces, y quizá las más, esperaban a que sus escuderos fuesen
viejos; y, ya después de hartos de servir y de llevar malos días y peores
noches, les daban algún título de conde, o, por lo mucho, de marqués, de
algún valle o provincia de poco más a menos; pero, si tú vives y yo vivo,
bien podría ser que antes de seis días ganase yo tal reino que tuviese
otros a él adherentes, que viniesen de molde para coronarte por rey de uno
dellos. Y no lo tengas a mucho, que cosas y casos acontecen a los tales
caballeros, por modos tan nunca vistos ni pensados, que con facilidad te
podría dar aún más de lo que te prometo.
— De esa manera —respondió Sancho Panza—, si yo fuese rey por algún milagro
de los que vuestra merced dice, por lo menos, Juana Gutiérrez, mi oíslo,
vendría a ser reina, y mis hijos infantes.
— Pues, ¿quién lo duda? —respondió don Quijote.
— Yo lo dudo —replicó Sancho Panza—; porque tengo para mí que, aunque
lloviese Dios reinos sobre la tierra, ninguno asentaría bien sobre la
cabeza de Mari Gutiérrez. Sepa, señor, que no vale dos maravedís para
reina; condesa le caerá mejor, y aun Dios y ayuda.
— Encomiéndalo tú a Dios, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que Él dará lo que
más le convenga, pero no apoques tu ánimo tanto, que te vengas a contentar
con menos que con ser adelantado.
— No lo haré, señor mío —respondió Sancho—; y más teniendo tan principal amo
en vuestra merced, que me sabrá dar todo aquello que me esté bien y yo
pueda llevar.
Capítulo VIII. Del buen suceso que el valeroso don Quijote tuvo en la
espantable y jamás imaginada aventura de los molinos de viento, con otros
sucesos dignos de felice recordación
En esto, descubrieron treinta o cuarenta molinos de viento que hay en aquel
campo; y, así como don Quijote los vio, dijo a su escudero:
— La ventura va guiando nuestras cosas mejor de lo que acertáramos a desear,
porque ves allí, amigo Sancho Panza, donde se descubren treinta, o pocos
más, desaforados gigantes, con quien pienso hacer batalla y quitarles a
todos las vidas, con cuyos despojos comenzaremos a enriquecer; que ésta es
buena guerra, y es gran servicio de Dios quitar tan mala simiente de sobre
la faz de la tierra.
— ¿Qué gigantes? —dijo Sancho Panza.
— Aquellos que allí ves —respondió su amo— de los brazos largos, que los
suelen tener algunos de casi dos leguas.
— Mire vuestra merced —respondió Sancho— que aquellos que allí se parecen no
son gigantes, sino molinos de viento, y lo que en ellos parecen brazos son
las aspas, que, volteadas del viento, hacen andar la piedra del molino.
— Bien parece —respondió don Quijote— que no estás cursado en esto de las
aventuras: ellos son gigantes; y si tienes miedo, quítate de ahí, y ponte
en oración en el espacio que yo voy a entrar con ellos en fiera y desigual
batalla.
Y, diciendo esto, dio de espuelas a su caballo Rocinante, sin atender a las
voces que su escudero Sancho le daba, advirtiéndole que, sin duda alguna,
eran molinos de viento, y no gigantes, aquellos que iba a acometer. Pero él
iba tan puesto en que eran gigantes, que ni oía las voces de su escudero
Sancho ni echaba de ver, aunque estaba ya bien cerca, lo que eran; antes,
iba diciendo en voces altas:
— Non fuyades, cobardes y viles criaturas, que un solo caballero es el que
os acomete.
Levantóse en esto un poco de viento y las grandes aspas comenzaron a
moverse, lo cual visto por don Quijote, dijo:
— Pues, aunque mováis más brazos que los del gigante Briareo, me lo habéis
de pagar.
Y, en diciendo esto, y encomendándose de todo corazón a su señora Dulcinea,
pidiéndole que en tal trance le socorriese, bien cubierto de su rodela, con
la lanza en el ristre, arremetió a todo el galope de Rocinante y embistió
con el primero molino que estaba delante; y, dándole una lanzada en el
aspa, la volvió el viento con tanta furia que hizo la lanza pedazos,
llevándose tras sí al caballo y al caballero, que fue rodando muy maltrecho
por el campo. Acudió Sancho Panza a socorrerle, a todo el correr de su
asno, y cuando llegó halló que no se podía menear: tal fue el golpe que dio
con él Rocinante.
— ¡Válame Dios! —dijo Sancho—. ¿No le dije yo a vuestra merced que mirase
bien lo que hacía, que no eran sino molinos de viento, y no lo podía
ignorar sino quien llevase otros tales en la cabeza?
— Calla, amigo Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que las cosas de la guerra,
más que otras, están sujetas a continua mudanza; cuanto más, que yo pienso,
y es así verdad, que aquel sabio Frestón que me robó el aposento y los
libros ha vuelto estos gigantes en molinos por quitarme la gloria de su
vencimiento: tal es la enemistad que me tiene; mas, al cabo al cabo, han de
poder poco sus malas artes contra la bondad de mi espada.
— Dios lo haga como puede —respondió Sancho Panza.
Y, ayudándole a levantar, tornó a subir sobre Rocinante, que medio
despaldado estaba. Y, hablando en la pasada aventura, siguieron el camino
del Puerto Lápice, porque allí decía don Quijote que no era posible dejar
de hallarse muchas y diversas aventuras, por ser lugar muy pasajero; sino
que iba muy pesaroso por haberle faltado la lanza; y, diciéndoselo a su
escudero, le dijo:
— Yo me acuerdo haber leído que un caballero español, llamado Diego Pérez de
Vargas, habiéndosele en una batalla roto la espada, desgajó de una encina
un pesado ramo o tronco, y con él hizo tales cosas aquel día, y machacó
tantos moros, que le quedó por sobrenombre Machuca, y así él como sus
decendientes se llamaron, desde aquel día en adelante, Vargas y Machuca.
Hete dicho esto, porque de la primera encina o roble que se me depare
pienso desgajar otro tronco tal y tan bueno como aquél, que me imagino y
pienso hacer con él tales hazañas, que tú te tengas por bien afortunado de
haber merecido venir a vellas y a ser testigo de cosas que apenas podrán
ser creídas.
— A la mano de Dios —dijo Sancho—; yo lo creo todo así como vuestra merced
lo dice; pero enderécese un poco, que parece que va de medio lado, y debe
de ser del molimiento de la caída.
— Así es la verdad —respondió don Quijote—; y si no me quejo del dolor, es
porque no es dado a los caballeros andantes quejarse de herida alguna,
aunque se le salgan las tripas por ella.
— Si eso es así, no tengo yo qué replicar —respondió Sancho—, pero sabe Dios
si yo me holgara que vuestra merced se quejara cuando alguna cosa le
doliera. De mí sé decir que me he de quejar del más pequeño dolor que
tenga, si ya no se entiende también con los escuderos de los caballeros
andantes eso del no quejarse.
No se dejó de reír don Quijote de la simplicidad de su escudero; y así, le
declaró que podía muy bien quejarse, como y cuando quisiese, sin gana o con
ella; que hasta entonces no había leído cosa en contrario en la orden de
caballería. Díjole Sancho que mirase que era hora de comer. Respondióle su
amo que por entonces no le hacía menester; que comiese él cuando se le
antojase. Con esta licencia, se acomodó Sancho lo mejor que pudo sobre su
jumento, y, sacando de las alforjas lo que en ellas había puesto, iba
caminando y comiendo detrás de su amo muy de su espacio, y de cuando en
cuando empinaba la bota, con tanto gusto, que le pudiera envidiar el más
regalado bodegonero de Málaga. Y, en tanto que él iba de aquella manera
menudeando tragos, no se le acordaba de ninguna promesa que su amo le
hubiese hecho, ni tenía por ningún trabajo, sino por mucho descanso, andar
buscando las aventuras, por peligrosas que fuesen.
En resolución, aquella noche la pasaron entre unos árboles, y del uno
dellos desgajó don Quijote un ramo seco que casi le podía servir de lanza,
y puso en él el hierro que quitó de la que se le había quebrado. Toda
aquella noche no durmió don Quijote, pensando en su señora Dulcinea, por
acomodarse a lo que había leído en sus libros, cuando los caballeros
pasaban sin dormir muchas noches en las florestas y despoblados,
entretenidos con las memorias de sus señoras. No la pasó ansí Sancho Panza,
que, como tenía el estómago lleno, y no de agua de chicoria, de un sueño se
la llevó toda; y no fueran parte para despertarle, si su amo no lo llamara,
los rayos del sol, que le daban en el rostro, ni el canto de las aves, que,
muchas y muy regocijadamente, la venida del nuevo día saludaban. Al
levantarse dio un tiento a la bota, y hallóla algo más flaca que la noche
antes; y afligiósele el corazón, por parecerle que no llevaban camino de
remediar tan presto su falta. No quiso desayunarse don Quijote, porque,
como está dicho, dio en sustentarse de sabrosas memorias. Tornaron a su
comenzado camino del Puerto Lápice, y a obra de las tres del día le
descubrieron.
— Aquí —dijo, en viéndole, don Quijote— podemos, hermano Sancho Panza, meter
las manos hasta los codos en esto que llaman aventuras. Mas advierte que,
aunque me veas en los mayores peligros del mundo, no has de poner mano a tu
espada para defenderme, si ya no vieres que los que me ofenden es canalla y
gente baja, que en tal caso bien puedes ayudarme; pero si fueren
caballeros, en ninguna manera te es lícito ni concedido por las leyes de
caballería que me ayudes, hasta que seas armado caballero.
— Por cierto, señor —respondió Sancho—, que vuestra merced sea muy bien
obedicido en esto; y más, que yo de mío me soy pacífico y enemigo de
meterme en ruidos ni pendencias. Bien es verdad que, en lo que tocare a
defender mi persona, no tendré mucha cuenta con esas leyes, pues las
divinas y humanas permiten que cada uno se defienda de quien quisiere
agraviarle.
— No digo yo menos —respondió don Quijote—; pero, en esto de ayudarme contra
caballeros, has de tener a raya tus naturales ímpetus.
— Digo que así lo haré —respondió Sancho—, y que guardaré ese preceto tan
bien como el día del domingo.
Estando en estas razones, asomaron por el camino dos frailes de la orden de
San Benito, caballeros sobre dos dromedarios: que no eran más pequeñas dos
mulas en que venían. Traían sus antojos de camino y sus quitasoles. Detrás
dellos venía un coche, con cuatro o cinco de a caballo que le acompañaban y
dos mozos de mulas a pie. Venía en el coche, como después se supo, una
señora vizcaína, que iba a Sevilla, donde estaba su marido, que pasaba a
las Indias con un muy honroso cargo. No venían los frailes con ella, aunque
iban el mesmo camino; mas, apenas los divisó don Quijote, cuando dijo a su
escudero:
— O yo me engaño, o ésta ha de ser la más famosa aventura que se haya visto;
porque aquellos bultos negros que allí parecen deben de ser, y son sin
duda, algunos encantadores que llevan hurtada alguna princesa en aquel
coche, y es menester deshacer este tuerto a todo mi poderío.
— Peor será esto que los molinos de viento —dijo Sancho—. Mire, señor, que
aquéllos son frailes de San Benito, y el coche debe de ser de alguna gente
pasajera. Mire que digo que mire bien lo que hace, no sea el diablo que le
engañe.
— Ya te he dicho, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que sabes poco de achaque
de aventuras; lo que yo digo es verdad, y ahora lo verás.
Y, diciendo esto, se adelantó y se puso en la mitad del camino por donde
los frailes venían, y, en llegando tan cerca que a él le pareció que le
podrían oír lo que dijese, en alta voz dijo:
— Gente endiablada y descomunal, dejad luego al punto las altas princesas
que en ese coche lleváis forzadas; si no, aparejaos a recebir presta
muerte, por justo castigo de vuestras malas obras.
Detuvieron los frailes las riendas, y quedaron admirados, así de la figura
de don Quijote como de sus razones, a las cuales respondieron:
— Señor caballero, nosotros no somos endiablados ni descomunales, sino dos
religiosos de San Benito que vamos nuestro camino, y no sabemos si en este
coche vienen, o no, ningunas forzadas princesas.
— Para conmigo no hay palabras blandas, que ya yo os conozco, fementida
canalla —dijo don Quijote.
Y, sin esperar más respuesta, picó a Rocinante y, la lanza baja, arremetió
contra el primero fraile, con tanta furia y denuedo que, si el fraile no se
dejara caer de la mula, él le hiciera venir al suelo mal de su grado, y aun
malferido, si no cayera muerto. El segundo religioso, que vio del modo que
trataban a su compañero, puso piernas al castillo de su buena mula, y
comenzó a correr por aquella campaña, más ligero que el mesmo viento.
Sancho Panza, que vio en el suelo al fraile, apeándose ligeramente de su
asno, arremetió a él y le comenzó a quitar los hábitos. Llegaron en esto
dos mozos de los frailes y preguntáronle que por qué le desnudaba.
Respondióles Sancho que aquello le tocaba a él ligítimamente, como despojos
de la batalla que su señor don Quijote había ganado. Los mozos, que no
sabían de burlas, ni entendían aquello de despojos ni batallas, viendo que
ya don Quijote estaba desviado de allí, hablando con las que en el coche
venían, arremetieron con Sancho y dieron con él en el suelo; y, sin dejarle
pelo en las barbas, le molieron a coces y le dejaron tendido en el suelo
sin aliento ni sentido. Y, sin detenerse un punto, tornó a subir el fraile,
todo temeroso y acobardado y sin color en el rostro; y, cuando se vio a
caballo, picó tras su compañero, que un buen espacio de allí le estaba
aguardando, y esperando en qué paraba aquel sobresalto; y, sin querer
aguardar el fin de todo aquel comenzado suceso, siguieron su camino,
haciéndose más cruces que si llevaran al diablo a las espaldas.
Don Quijote estaba, como se ha dicho, hablando con la señora del coche,
diciéndole:
— La vuestra fermosura, señora mía, puede facer de su persona lo que más le
viniere en talante, porque ya la soberbia de vuestros robadores yace por el
suelo, derribada por este mi fuerte brazo; y, porque no penéis por saber el
nombre de vuestro libertador, sabed que yo me llamo don Quijote de la
Mancha, caballero andante y aventurero, y cautivo de la sin par y hermosa
doña Dulcinea del Toboso; y, en pago del beneficio que de mí habéis
recebido, no quiero otra cosa sino que volváis al Toboso, y que de mi parte
os presentéis ante esta señora y le digáis lo que por vuestra libertad he
fecho.
Todo esto que don Quijote decía escuchaba un escudero de los que el coche
acompañaban, que era vizcaíno; el cual, viendo que no quería dejar pasar el
coche adelante, sino que decía que luego había de dar la vuelta al Toboso,
se fue para don Quijote y, asiéndole de la lanza, le dijo, en mala lengua
castellana y peor vizcaína, desta manera:
— Anda, caballero que mal andes; por el Dios que crióme, que, si no dejas
coche, así te matas como estás ahí vizcaíno.
Entendióle muy bien don Quijote, y con mucho sosiego le respondió:
— Si fueras caballero, como no lo eres, ya yo hubiera castigado tu sandez y
atrevimiento, cautiva criatura.
A lo cual replicó el vizcaíno:
— ¿Yo no caballero? Juro a Dios tan mientes como cristiano. Si lanza
arrojas y espada sacas, ¡el agua cuán presto verás que al gato llevas!
Vizcaíno por tierra, hidalgo por mar, hidalgo por el diablo; y mientes que
mira si otra dices cosa.
— ¡Ahora lo veredes, dijo Agrajes! —respondió don Quijote.
Y, arrojando la lanza en el suelo, sacó su espada y embrazó su rodela, y
arremetió al vizcaíno con determinación de quitarle la vida. El vizcaíno,
que así le vio venir, aunque quisiera apearse de la mula, que, por ser de
las malas de alquiler, no había que fiar en ella, no pudo hacer otra cosa
sino sacar su espada; pero avínole bien que se halló junto al coche, de
donde pudo tomar una almohada que le sirvió de escudo, y luego se fueron el
uno para el otro, como si fueran dos mortales enemigos. La demás gente
quisiera ponerlos en paz, mas no pudo, porque decía el vizcaíno en sus mal
trabadas razones que si no le dejaban acabar su batalla, que él mismo había
de matar a su ama y a toda la gente que se lo estorbase. La señora del
coche, admirada y temerosa de lo que veía, hizo al cochero que se desviase
de allí algún poco, y desde lejos se puso a mirar la rigurosa contienda, en
el discurso de la cual dio el vizcaíno una gran cuchillada a don Quijote
encima de un hombro, por encima de la rodela, que, a dársela sin defensa,
le abriera hasta la cintura. Don Quijote, que sintió la pesadumbre de aquel
desaforado golpe, dio una gran voz, diciendo:
— ¡Oh señora de mi alma, Dulcinea, flor de la fermosura, socorred a este
vuestro caballero, que, por satisfacer a la vuestra mucha bondad, en este
riguroso trance se halla!
El decir esto, y el apretar la espada, y el cubrirse bien de su rodela, y
el arremeter al vizcaíno, todo fue en un tiempo, llevando determinación de
aventurarlo todo a la de un golpe solo.
El vizcaíno, que así le vio venir contra él, bien entendió por su denuedo
su coraje, y determinó de hacer lo mesmo que don Quijote; y así, le aguardó
bien cubierto de su almohada, sin poder rodear la mula a una ni a otra
parte; que ya, de puro cansada y no hecha a semejantes niñerías, no podía
dar un paso.
Venía, pues, como se ha dicho, don Quijote contra el cauto vizcaíno, con la
espada en alto, con determinación de abrirle por medio, y el vizcaíno le
aguardaba ansimesmo levantada la espada y aforrado con su almohada, y todos
los circunstantes estaban temerosos y colgados de lo que había de suceder
de aquellos tamaños golpes con que se amenazaban; y la señora del coche y
las demás criadas suyas estaban haciendo mil votos y ofrecimientos a todas
las imágenes y casas de devoción de España, porque Dios librase a su
escudero y a ellas de aquel tan grande peligro en que se hallaban.
Pero está el daño de todo esto que en este punto y término deja pendiente
el autor desta historia esta batalla, disculpándose que no halló más
escrito destas hazañas de don Quijote de las que deja referidas. Bien es
verdad que el segundo autor desta obra no quiso creer que tan curiosa
historia estuviese entregada a las leyes del olvido, ni que hubiesen sido
tan poco curiosos los ingenios de la Mancha que no tuviesen en sus archivos
o en sus escritorios algunos papeles que deste famoso caballero tratasen; y
así, con esta imaginación, no se desesperó de hallar el fin desta apacible
historia, el cual, siéndole el cielo favorable, le halló del modo que se
contará en la segunda parte.
Segunda parte del ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha
Capítulo IX. Donde se concluye y da fin a la estupenda batalla que el
gallardo vizcaíno y el valiente manchego tuvieron
Dejamos en la primera parte desta historia al valeroso vizcaíno y al famoso
don Quijote con las espadas altas y desnudas, en guisa de descargar dos
furibundos fendientes, tales que, si en lleno se acertaban, por lo menos
se dividirían y fenderían de arriba abajo y abrirían como una granada; y
que en aquel punto tan dudoso paró y quedó destroncada tan sabrosa
historia, sin que nos diese noticia su autor dónde se podría hallar lo que
della faltaba.
Causóme esto mucha pesadumbre, porque el gusto de haber leído tan poco se
volvía en disgusto, de pensar el mal camino que se ofrecía para hallar lo
mucho que, a mi parecer, faltaba de tan sabroso cuento. Parecióme cosa
imposible y fuera de toda buena costumbre que a tan buen caballero le
hubiese faltado algún sabio que tomara a cargo el escrebir sus nunca vistas
hazañas, cosa que no faltó a ninguno de los caballeros andantes,
de los que dicen las gentes
que van a sus aventuras,
porque cada uno dellos tenía uno o dos sabios, como de molde, que no
solamente escribían sus hechos, sino que pintaban sus más mínimos
pensamientos y niñerías, por más escondidas que fuesen; y no había de ser
tan desdichado tan buen caballero, que le faltase a él lo que sobró a
Platir y a otros semejantes. Y así, no podía inclinarme a creer que tan
gallarda historia hubiese quedado manca y estropeada; y echaba la culpa a
la malignidad del tiempo, devorador y consumidor de todas las cosas, el
cual, o la tenía oculta o consumida.
Por otra parte, me parecía que, pues entre sus libros se habían hallado tan
modernos como Desengaño de celos y Ninfas y Pastores de Henares, que
también su historia debía de ser moderna; y que, ya que no estuviese
escrita, estaría en la memoria de la gente de su aldea y de las a ella
circunvecinas. Esta imaginación me traía confuso y deseoso de saber, real y
verdaderamente, toda la vida y milagros de nuestro famoso español don
Quijote de la Mancha, luz y espejo de la caballería manchega, y el primero
que en nuestra edad y en estos tan calamitosos tiempos se puso al trabajo y
ejercicio de las andantes armas, y al desfacer agravios, socorrer viudas,
amparar doncellas, de aquellas que andaban con sus azotes y palafrenes, y
con toda su virginidad a cuestas, de monte en monte y de valle en valle;
que, si no era que algún follón, o algún villano de hacha y capellina, o
algún descomunal gigante las forzaba, doncella hubo en los pasados tiempos
que, al cabo de ochenta años, que en todos ellos no durmió un día debajo de
tejado, y se fue tan entera a la sepultura como la madre que la había
parido. Digo, pues, que, por estos y otros muchos respetos, es digno
nuestro gallardo Quijote de continuas y memorables alabanzas; y aun a mí no
se me deben negar, por el trabajo y diligencia que puse en buscar el fin
desta agradable historia; aunque bien sé que si el cielo, el caso y la
fortuna no me ayudan, el mundo quedará falto y sin el pasatiempo y gusto
que bien casi dos horas podrá tener el que con atención la leyere. Pasó,
pues, el hallarla en esta manera:
Estando yo un día en el Alcaná de Toledo, llegó un muchacho a vender unos
cartapacios y papeles viejos a un sedero; y, como yo soy aficionado a leer,
aunque sean los papeles rotos de las calles, llevado desta mi natural
inclinación, tomé un cartapacio de los que el muchacho vendía, y vile con
caracteres que conocí ser arábigos. Y, puesto que, aunque los conocía, no
los sabía leer, anduve mirando si parecía por allí algún morisco aljamiado
que los leyese; y no fue muy dificultoso hallar intérprete semejante, pues,
aunque le buscara de otra mejor y más antigua lengua, le hallara. En fin,
la suerte me deparó uno, que, diciéndole mi deseo y poniéndole el libro en
las manos, le abrió por medio, y, leyendo un poco en él, se comenzó a reír.
Preguntéle yo que de qué se reía, y respondióme que de una cosa que tenía
aquel libro escrita en el margen por anotación. Díjele que me la dijese; y
él, sin dejar la risa, dijo:
— Está, como he dicho, aquí en el margen escrito esto: "Esta Dulcinea del
Toboso, tantas veces en esta historia referida, dicen que tuvo la mejor
mano para salar puercos que otra mujer de toda la Mancha".
Cuando yo oí decir "Dulcinea del Toboso", quedé atónito y suspenso, porque
luego se me representó que aquellos cartapacios contenían la historia de
don Quijote. Con esta imaginación, le di priesa que leyese el principio, y,
haciéndolo ansí, volviendo de improviso el arábigo en castellano, dijo que
decía: Historia de don Quijote de la Mancha, escrita por Cide Hamete
Benengeli, historiador arábigo. Mucha discreción fue menester para
disimular el contento que recebí cuando llegó a mis oídos el título del
libro; y, salteándosele al sedero, compré al muchacho todos los papeles y
cartapacios por medio real; que, si él tuviera discreción y supiera lo que
yo los deseaba, bien se pudiera prometer y llevar más de seis reales de la
compra. Apartéme luego con el morisco por el claustro de la iglesia mayor,
y roguéle me volviese aquellos cartapacios, todos los que trataban de don
Quijote, en lengua castellana, sin quitarles ni añadirles nada,
ofreciéndole la paga que él quisiese. Contentóse con dos arrobas de pasas y
dos fanegas de trigo, y prometió de traducirlos bien y fielmente y con
mucha brevedad. Pero yo, por facilitar más el negocio y por no dejar de la
mano tan buen hallazgo, le truje a mi casa, donde en poco más de mes y
medio la tradujo toda, del mesmo modo que aquí se refiere.
Estaba en el primero cartapacio, pintada muy al natural, la batalla de don
Quijote con el vizcaíno, puestos en la mesma postura que la historia
cuenta, levantadas las espadas, el uno cubierto de su rodela, el otro de la
almohada, y la mula del vizcaíno tan al vivo, que estaba mostrando ser de
alquiler a tiro de ballesta. Tenía a los pies escrito el vizcaíno un título
que decía: Don Sancho de Azpetia, que, sin duda, debía de ser su nombre, y
a los pies de Rocinante estaba otro que decía: Don Quijote. Estaba
Rocinante maravillosamente pintado, tan largo y tendido, tan atenuado y
flaco, con tanto espinazo, tan hético confirmado, que mostraba bien al
descubierto con cuánta advertencia y propriedad se le había puesto el
nombre de Rocinante. Junto a él estaba Sancho Panza, que tenía del cabestro
a su asno, a los pies del cual estaba otro rétulo que decía: Sancho Zancas,
y debía de ser que tenía, a lo que mostraba la pintura, la barriga grande,
el talle corto y las zancas largas; y por esto se le debió de poner nombre
de Panza y de Zancas, que con estos dos sobrenombres le llama algunas veces
la historia. Otras algunas menudencias había que advertir, pero todas son
de poca importancia y que no hacen al caso a la verdadera relación de la
historia; que ninguna es mala como sea verdadera.
Si a ésta se le puede poner alguna objeción cerca de su verdad, no podrá
ser otra sino haber sido su autor arábigo, siendo muy propio de los de
aquella nación ser mentirosos; aunque, por ser tan nuestros enemigos, antes
se puede entender haber quedado falto en ella que demasiado. Y ansí me
parece a mí, pues, cuando pudiera y debiera estender la pluma en las
alabanzas de tan buen caballero, parece que de industria las pasa en
silencio: cosa mal hecha y peor pensada, habiendo y debiendo ser los
historiadores puntuales, verdaderos y no nada apasionados, y que ni el
interés ni el miedo, el rancor ni la afición, no les hagan torcer del
camino de la verdad, cuya madre es la historia, émula del tiempo, depósito
de las acciones, testigo de lo pasado, ejemplo y aviso de lo presente,
advertencia de lo por venir. En ésta sé que se hallará todo lo que se
acertare a desear en la más apacible; y si algo bueno en ella faltare, para
mí tengo que fue por culpa del galgo de su autor, antes que por falta del
sujeto. En fin, su segunda parte, siguiendo la tradución, comenzaba desta
manera:
Puestas y levantadas en alto las cortadoras espadas de los dos valerosos y
enojados combatientes, no parecía sino que estaban amenazando al cielo, a
la tierra y al abismo: tal era el denuedo y continente que tenían. Y el
primero que fue a descargar el golpe fue el colérico vizcaíno, el cual fue
dado con tanta fuerza y tanta furia que, a no volvérsele la espada en el
camino, aquel solo golpe fuera bastante para dar fin a su rigurosa
contienda y a todas las aventuras de nuestro caballero; mas la buena
suerte, que para mayores cosas le tenía guardado, torció la espada de su
contrario, de modo que, aunque le acertó en el hombro izquierdo, no le hizo
otro daño que desarmarle todo aquel lado, llevándole de camino gran parte
de la celada, con la mitad de la oreja; que todo ello con espantosa ruina
vino al suelo, dejándole muy maltrecho.
¡Válame Dios, y quién será aquel que buenamente pueda contar ahora la rabia
que entró en el corazón de nuestro manchego, viéndose parar de aquella
manera! No se diga más, sino que fue de manera que se alzó de nuevo en los
estribos, y, apretando más la espada en las dos manos, con tal furia
descargó sobre el vizcaíno, acertándole de lleno sobre la almohada y sobre
la cabeza, que, sin ser parte tan buena defensa, como si cayera sobre él
una montaña, comenzó a echar sangre por las narices, y por la boca y por
los oídos, y a dar muestras de caer de la mula abajo, de donde cayera, sin
duda, si no se abrazara con el cuello; pero, con todo eso, sacó los pies de
los estribos y luego soltó los brazos; y la mula, espantada del terrible
golpe, dio a correr por el campo, y a pocos corcovos dio con su dueño en
tierra.
Estábaselo con mucho sosiego mirando don Quijote, y, como lo vio caer,
saltó de su caballo y con mucha ligereza se llegó a él, y, poniéndole la
punta de la espada en los ojos, le dijo que se rindiese; si no, que le
cortaría la cabeza. Estaba el vizcaíno tan turbado que no podía responder
palabra, y él lo pasara mal, según estaba ciego don Quijote, si las señoras
del coche, que hasta entonces con gran desmayo habían mirado la pendencia,
no fueran adonde estaba y le pidieran con mucho encarecimiento les hiciese
tan gran merced y favor de perdonar la vida a aquel su escudero. A lo cual
don Quijote respondió, con mucho entono y gravedad:
— Por cierto, fermosas señoras, yo soy muy contento de hacer lo que me
pedís; mas ha de ser con una condición y concierto, y es que este caballero
me ha de prometer de ir al lugar del Toboso y presentarse de mi parte ante
la sin par doña Dulcinea, para que ella haga dél lo que más fuere de su
voluntad.
La temerosa y desconsolada señora, sin entrar en cuenta de lo que don
Quijote pedía, y sin preguntar quién Dulcinea fuese, le prometió que el
escudero haría todo aquello que de su parte le fuese mandado.
— Pues en fe de esa palabra, yo no le haré más daño, puesto que me lo tenía
bien merecido.
Capítulo X. De lo que más le avino a don Quijote con el vizcaíno, y del
peligro en que se vio con una turba de yangüeses
Ya en este tiempo se había levantado Sancho Panza, algo maltratado de los
mozos de los frailes, y había estado atento a la batalla de su señor don
Quijote, y rogaba a Dios en su corazón fuese servido de darle vitoria y que
en ella ganase alguna ínsula de donde le hiciese gobernador, como se lo
había prometido. Viendo, pues, ya acabada la pendencia, y que su amo volvía
a subir sobre Rocinante, llegó a tenerle el estribo; y antes que subiese se
hincó de rodillas delante dél, y, asiéndole de la mano, se la besó y le
dijo:
— Sea vuestra merced servido, señor don Quijote mío, de darme el gobierno de
la ínsula que en esta rigurosa pendencia se ha ganado; que, por grande que
sea, yo me siento con fuerzas de saberla gobernar tal y tan bien como otro
que haya gobernado ínsulas en el mundo.
A lo cual respondió don Quijote:
— Advertid, hermano Sancho, que esta aventura y las a ésta semejantes no
son aventuras de ínsulas, sino de encrucijadas, en las cuales no se gana
otra cosa que sacar rota la cabeza o una oreja menos. Tened paciencia, que
aventuras se ofrecerán donde no solamente os pueda hacer gobernador, sino
más adelante.
Agradecióselo mucho Sancho, y, besándole otra vez la mano y la falda de la
loriga, le ayudó a subir sobre Rocinante; y él subió sobre su asno y
comenzó a seguir a su señor, que, a paso tirado, sin despedirse ni hablar
más con las del coche, se entró por un bosque que allí junto estaba.
Seguíale Sancho a todo el trote de su jumento, pero caminaba tanto
Rocinante que, viéndose quedar atrás, le fue forzoso dar voces a su amo que
se aguardase. Hízolo así don Quijote, teniendo las riendas a Rocinante
hasta que llegase su cansado escudero, el cual, en llegando, le dijo:
— Paréceme, señor, que sería acertado irnos a retraer a alguna iglesia; que,
según quedó maltrecho aquel con quien os combatistes, no será mucho que den
noticia del caso a la Santa Hermandad y nos prendan; y a fe que si lo
hacen, que primero que salgamos de la cárcel que nos ha de sudar el hopo.
— Calla —dijo don Quijote—. Y ¿dónde has visto tú, o leído jamás, que
caballero andante haya sido puesto ante la justicia, por más homicidios que
hubiese cometido?
— Yo no sé nada de omecillos —respondió Sancho—, ni en mi vida le caté a
ninguno; sólo sé que la Santa Hermandad tiene que ver con los que pelean en
el campo, y en esotro no me entremeto.
— Pues no tengas pena, amigo —respondió don Quijote—, que yo te sacaré de
las manos de los caldeos, cuanto más de las de la Hermandad. Pero dime, por
tu vida: ¿has visto más valeroso caballero que yo en todo lo descubierto de
la tierra? ¿Has leído en historias otro que tenga ni haya tenido más brío
en acometer, más aliento en el perseverar, más destreza en el herir, ni más
maña en el derribar?
— La verdad sea —respondió Sancho— que yo no he leído ninguna historia
jamás, porque ni sé leer ni escrebir; mas lo que osaré apostar es que más
atrevido amo que vuestra merced yo no le he servido en todos los días de mi
vida, y quiera Dios que estos atrevimientos no se paguen donde tengo
dicho. Lo que le ruego a vuestra merced es que se cure, que le va mucha
sangre de esa oreja; que aquí traigo hilas y un poco de ungüento blanco en
las alforjas.
— Todo eso fuera bien escusado —respondió don Quijote— si a mí se me
acordara de hacer una redoma del bálsamo de Fierabrás, que con sola una
gota se ahorraran tiempo y medicinas.
— ¿Qué redoma y qué bálsamo es ése? —dijo Sancho Panza.
— Es un bálsamo —respondió don Quijote— de quien tengo la receta en la
memoria, con el cual no hay que tener temor a la muerte, ni hay pensar
morir de ferida alguna. Y ansí, cuando yo le haga y te le dé, no tienes más
que hacer sino que, cuando vieres que en alguna batalla me han partido por
medio del cuerpo (como muchas veces suele acontecer), bonitamente la parte
del cuerpo que hubiere caído en el suelo, y con mucha sotileza, antes que
la sangre se yele, la pondrás sobre la otra mitad que quedare en la silla,
advirtiendo de encajallo igualmente y al justo; luego me darás a beber
solos dos tragos del bálsamo que he dicho, y verásme quedar más sano que
una manzana.
— Si eso hay —dijo Panza—, yo renuncio desde aquí el gobierno de la
prometida ínsula, y no quiero otra cosa, en pago de mis muchos y buenos
servicios, sino que vuestra merced me dé la receta de ese estremado licor;
que para mí tengo que valdrá la onza adondequiera más de a dos reales, y no
he menester yo más para pasar esta vida honrada y descansadamente. Pero es
de saber agora si tiene mucha costa el hacelle.
— Con menos de tres reales se pueden hacer tres azumbres —respondió don
Quijote.
— ¡Pecador de mí! —replicó Sancho—. ¿Pues a qué aguarda vuestra merced a
hacelle y a enseñármele?
— Calla, amigo —respondió don Quijote—, que mayores secretos pienso
enseñarte y mayores mercedes hacerte; y, por agora, curémonos, que la oreja
me duele más de lo que yo quisiera.
Sacó Sancho de las alforjas hilas y ungüento. Mas, cuando don Quijote llegó
a ver rota su celada, pensó perder el juicio, y, puesta la mano en la
espada y alzando los ojos al cielo, dijo:
— Yo hago juramento al Criador de todas las cosas y a los santos cuatro
Evangelios, donde más largamente están escritos, de hacer la vida que hizo
el grande marqués de Mantua cuando juró de vengar la muerte de su sobrino
Valdovinos, que fue de no comer pan a manteles, ni con su mujer folgar, y
otras cosas que, aunque dellas no me acuerdo, las doy aquí por expresadas,
hasta tomar entera venganza del que tal desaguisado me fizo.
Oyendo esto Sancho, le dijo:
— Advierta vuestra merced, señor don Quijote, que si el caballero cumplió lo
que se le dejó ordenado de irse a presentar ante mi señora Dulcinea del
Toboso, ya habrá cumplido con lo que debía, y no merece otra pena si no
comete nuevo delito.
— Has hablado y apuntado muy bien —respondió don Quijote—; y así, anulo el
juramento en cuanto lo que toca a tomar dél nueva venganza; pero hágole y
confírmole de nuevo de hacer la vida que he dicho, hasta tanto que quite
por fuerza otra celada tal y tan buena como ésta a algún caballero. Y no
pienses, Sancho, que así a humo de pajas hago esto, que bien tengo a quien
imitar en ello; que esto mesmo pasó, al pie de la letra, sobre el yelmo de
Mambrino, que tan caro le costó a Sacripante.
— Que dé al diablo vuestra merced tales juramentos, señor mío —replicó
Sancho—; que son muy en daño de la salud y muy en perjuicio de la
conciencia. Si no, dígame ahora: si acaso en muchos días no topamos hombre
armado con celada, ¿qué hemos de hacer? ¿Hase de cumplir el juramento, a
despecho de tantos inconvenientes e incomodidades, como será el dormir
vestido, y el no dormir en poblado, y otras mil penitencias que contenía el
juramento de aquel loco viejo del marqués de Mantua, que vuestra merced
quiere revalidar ahora? Mire vuestra merced bien, que por todos estos
caminos no andan hombres armados, sino arrieros y carreteros, que no sólo
no traen celadas, pero quizá no las han oído nombrar en todos los días de
su vida.
— Engáñaste en eso —dijo don Quijote—, porque no habremos estado dos horas
por estas encrucijadas, cuando veamos más armados que los que vinieron
sobre Albraca a la conquista de Angélica la Bella.
— Alto, pues; sea ansí —dijo Sancho—, y a Dios prazga que nos suceda bien, y
que se llegue ya el tiempo de ganar esta ínsula que tan cara me cuesta, y
muérame yo luego.
— Ya te he dicho, Sancho, que no te dé eso cuidado alguno; que, cuando
faltare ínsula, ahí está el reino de Dinamarca o el de Soliadisa, que te
vendrán como anillo al dedo; y más, que, por ser en tierra firme, te debes
más alegrar. Pero dejemos esto para su tiempo, y mira si traes algo en esas
alforjas que comamos, porque vamos luego en busca de algún castillo donde
alojemos esta noche y hagamos el bálsamo que te he dicho; porque yo te voto
a Dios que me va doliendo mucho la oreja.
— Aquí trayo una cebolla, y un poco de queso y no sé cuántos mendrugos de
pan —dijo Sancho—, pero no son manjares que pertenecen a tan valiente
caballero como vuestra merced.
— ¡Qué mal lo entiendes! —respondió don Quijote—. Hágote saber, Sancho, que
es honra de los caballeros andantes no comer en un mes; y, ya que coman,
sea de aquello que hallaren más a mano; y esto se te hiciera cierto si
hubieras leído tantas historias como yo; que, aunque han sido muchas, en
todas ellas no he hallado hecha relación de que los caballeros andantes
comiesen, si no era acaso y en algunos suntuosos banquetes que les hacían,
y los demás días se los pasaban en flores. Y, aunque se deja entender que
no podían pasar sin comer y sin hacer todos los otros menesteres naturales,
porque, en efeto, eran hombres como nosotros, hase de entender también que,
andando lo más del tiempo de su vida por las florestas y despoblados, y sin
cocinero, que su más ordinaria comida sería de viandas rústicas, tales como
las que tú ahora me ofreces. Así que, Sancho amigo, no te congoje lo que a
mí me da gusto. Ni querrás tú hacer mundo nuevo, ni sacar la caballería
andante de sus quicios.
— Perdóneme vuestra merced —dijo Sancho—; que, como yo no sé leer ni
escrebir, como otra vez he dicho, no sé ni he caído en las reglas de la
profesión caballeresca; y, de aquí adelante, yo proveeré las alforjas de
todo género de fruta seca para vuestra merced, que es caballero, y para mí
las proveeré, pues no lo soy, de otras cosas volátiles y de más sustancia.
— No digo yo, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—, que sea forzoso a los caballeros
andantes no comer otra cosa sino esas frutas que dices, sino que su más
ordinario sustento debía de ser dellas, y de algunas yerbas que hallaban
por los campos, que ellos conocían y yo también conozco.
— Virtud es —respondió Sancho— conocer esas yerbas; que, según yo me voy
imaginando, algún día será menester usar de ese conocimiento.
Y, sacando, en esto, lo que dijo que traía, comieron los dos en buena paz y
compaña. Pero, deseosos de buscar donde alojar aquella noche, acabaron con
mucha brevedad su pobre y seca comida. Subieron luego a caballo, y diéronse
priesa por llegar a poblado antes que anocheciese; pero faltóles el sol, y
la esperanza de alcanzar lo que deseaban, junto a unas chozas de unos
cabreros, y así, determinaron de pasarla allí; que cuanto fue de pesadumbre
para Sancho no llegar a poblado, fue de contento para su amo dormirla al
cielo descubierto, por parecerle que cada vez que esto le sucedía era hacer
un acto posesivo que facilitaba la prueba de su caballería.
Capítulo XI. De lo que le sucedió a don Quijote con unos cabreros
Fue recogido de los cabreros con buen ánimo; y, habiendo Sancho, lo mejor
que pudo, acomodado a Rocinante y a su jumento, se fue tras el olor que
despedían de sí ciertos tasajos de cabra que hirviendo al fuego en un
caldero estaban; y, aunque él quisiera en aquel mesmo punto ver si estaban
en sazón de trasladarlos del caldero al estómago, lo dejó de hacer, porque
los cabreros los quitaron del fuego, y, tendiendo por el suelo unas pieles
de ovejas, aderezaron con mucha priesa su rústica mesa y convidaron a los
dos, con muestras de muy buena voluntad, con lo que tenían. Sentáronse a la
redonda de las pieles seis dellos, que eran los que en la majada había,
habiendo primero con groseras ceremonias rogado a don Quijote que se
sentase sobre un dornajo que vuelto del revés le pusieron. Sentóse don
Quijote, y quedábase Sancho en pie para servirle la copa, que era hecha de
cuerno. Viéndole en pie su amo, le dijo:
— Porque veas, Sancho, el bien que en sí encierra la andante caballería, y
cuán a pique están los que en cualquiera ministerio della se ejercitan de
venir brevemente a ser honrados y estimados del mundo, quiero que aquí a mi
lado y en compañía desta buena gente te sientes, y que seas una mesma cosa
conmigo, que soy tu amo y natural señor; que comas en mi plato y bebas por
donde yo bebiere; porque de la caballería andante se puede decir lo mesmo
que del amor se dice: que todas las cosas iguala.
— ¡Gran merced! —dijo Sancho—; pero sé decir a vuestra merced que, como yo
tuviese bien de comer, tan bien y mejor me lo comería en pie y a mis solas
como sentado a par de un emperador. Y aun, si va a decir verdad, mucho
mejor me sabe lo que como en mi rincón, sin melindres ni respetos, aunque
sea pan y cebolla, que los gallipavos de otras mesas donde me sea forzoso
mascar despacio, beber poco, limpiarme a menudo, no estornudar ni toser si
me viene gana, ni hacer otras cosas que la soledad y la libertad traen
consigo. Ansí que, señor mío, estas honras que vuestra merced quiere darme
por ser ministro y adherente de la caballería andante, como lo soy siendo
escudero de vuestra merced, conviértalas en otras cosas que me sean de más
cómodo y provecho; que éstas, aunque las doy por bien recebidas, las
renuncio para desde aquí al fin del mundo.
— Con todo eso, te has de sentar; porque a quien se humilla, Dios le
ensalza.
Y, asiéndole por el brazo, le forzó a que junto dél se sentase.
No entendían los cabreros aquella jerigonza de escuderos y de caballeros
andantes, y no hacían otra cosa que comer y callar, y mirar a sus
huéspedes, que, con mucho donaire y gana, embaulaban tasajo como el puño.
Acabado el servicio de carne, tendieron sobre las zaleas gran cantidad de
bellotas avellanadas, y juntamente pusieron un medio queso, más duro que si
fuera hecho de argamasa. No estaba, en esto, ocioso el cuerno, porque
andaba a la redonda tan a menudo (ya lleno, ya vacío, como arcaduz de
noria) que con facilidad vació un zaque de dos que estaban de manifiesto.
Después que don Quijote hubo bien satisfecho su estómago, tomó un puño de
bellotas en la mano, y, mirándolas atentamente, soltó la voz a semejantes
razones:
— Dichosa edad y siglos dichosos aquéllos a quien los antiguos pusieron
nombre de dorados, y no porque en ellos el oro, que en esta nuestra edad de
hierro tanto se estima, se alcanzase en aquella venturosa sin fatiga
alguna, sino porque entonces los que en ella vivían ignoraban estas dos
palabras de tuyo y mío. Eran en aquella santa edad todas las cosas comunes;
a nadie le era necesario, para alcanzar su ordinario sustento, tomar otro
trabajo que alzar la mano y alcanzarle de las robustas encinas, que
liberalmente les estaban convidando con su dulce y sazonado fruto. Las
claras fuentes y corrientes ríos, en magnífica abundancia, sabrosas y
transparentes aguas les ofrecían. En las quiebras de las peñas y en lo
hueco de los árboles formaban su república las solícitas y discretas
abejas, ofreciendo a cualquiera mano, sin interés alguno, la fértil cosecha
de su dulcísimo trabajo. Los valientes alcornoques despedían de sí, sin
otro artificio que el de su cortesía, sus anchas y livianas cortezas, con
que se comenzaron a cubrir las casas, sobre rústicas estacas sustentadas,
no más que para defensa de las inclemencias del cielo. Todo era paz
entonces, todo amistad, todo concordia; aún no se había atrevido la pesada
reja del corvo arado a abrir ni visitar las entrañas piadosas de nuestra
primera madre, que ella, sin ser forzada, ofrecía, por todas las partes de
su fértil y espacioso seno, lo que pudiese hartar, sustentar y deleitar a
los hijos que entonces la poseían. Entonces sí que andaban las simples y
hermosas zagalejas de valle en valle y de otero en otero, en trenza y en
cabello, sin más vestidos de aquellos que eran menester para cubrir
honestamente lo que la honestidad quiere y ha querido siempre que se cubra;
y no eran sus adornos de los que ahora se usan, a quien la púrpura de Tiro
y la por tantos modos martirizada seda encarecen, sino de algunas hojas
verdes de lampazos y yedra entretejidas, con lo que quizá iban tan pomposas
y compuestas como van agora nuestras cortesanas con las raras y peregrinas
invenciones que la curiosidad ociosa les ha mostrado. Entonces se decoraban
los concetos amorosos del alma simple y sencillamente, del mesmo modo y
manera que ella los concebía, sin buscar artificioso rodeo de palabras para
encarecerlos. No había la fraude, el engaño ni la malicia mezcládose con la
verdad y llaneza. La justicia se estaba en sus proprios términos, sin que
la osasen turbar ni ofender los del favor y los del interese, que tanto
ahora la menoscaban, turban y persiguen. La ley del encaje aún no se había
sentado en el entendimiento del juez, porque entonces no había qué juzgar,
ni quién fuese juzgado. Las doncellas y la honestidad andaban, como tengo
dicho, por dondequiera, sola y señora, sin temor que la ajena desenvoltura
y lascivo intento le menoscabasen, y su perdición nacía de su gusto y
propria voluntad. Y agora, en estos nuestros detestables siglos, no está
segura ninguna, aunque la oculte y cierre otro nuevo laberinto como el de
Creta; porque allí, por los resquicios o por el aire, con el celo de la
maldita solicitud, se les entra la amorosa pestilencia y les hace dar con
todo su recogimiento al traste. Para cuya seguridad, andando más los
tiempos y creciendo más la malicia, se instituyó la orden de los caballeros
andantes, para defender las doncellas, amparar las viudas y socorrer a los
huérfanos y a los menesterosos. Desta orden soy yo, hermanos cabreros, a
quien agradezco el gasaje y buen acogimiento que hacéis a mí y a mi
escudero; que, aunque por ley natural están todos los que viven obligados a
favorecer a los caballeros andantes, todavía, por saber que sin saber
vosotros esta obligación me acogistes y regalastes, es razón que, con la
voluntad a mí posible, os agradezca la vuestra.
Toda esta larga arenga —que se pudiera muy bien escusar— dijo nuestro
caballero porque las bellotas que le dieron le trujeron a la memoria la
edad dorada y antojósele hacer aquel inútil razonamiento a los cabreros,
que, sin respondelle palabra, embobados y suspensos, le estuvieron
escuchando. Sancho, asimesmo, callaba y comía bellotas, y visitaba muy a
menudo el segundo zaque, que, porque se enfriase el vino, le tenían colgado
de un alcornoque.
Más tardó en hablar don Quijote que en acabarse la cena; al fin de la cual,
uno de los cabreros dijo:
— Para que con más veras pueda vuestra merced decir, señor caballero
andante, que le agasajamos con prompta y buena voluntad, queremos darle
solaz y contento con hacer que cante un compañero nuestro que no tardará
mucho en estar aquí; el cual es un zagal muy entendido y muy enamorado, y
que, sobre todo, sabe leer y escrebir y es músico de un rabel, que no hay
más que desear.
Apenas había el cabrero acabado de decir esto, cuando llegó a sus oídos el
son del rabel, y de allí a poco llegó el que le tañía, que era un mozo de
hasta veinte y dos años, de muy buena gracia. Preguntáronle sus compañeros
si había cenado, y, respondiendo que sí, el que había hecho los
ofrecimientos le dijo:
— De esa manera, Antonio, bien podrás hacernos placer de cantar un poco,
porque vea este señor huésped que tenemos quien; también por los montes y
selvas hay quien sepa de música. Hémosle dicho tus buenas habilidades, y
deseamos que las muestres y nos saques verdaderos; y así, te ruego por tu
vida que te sientes y cantes el romance de tus amores que te compuso el
beneficiado tu tío, que en el pueblo ha parecido muy bien.
— Que me place —respondió el mozo.
Y, sin hacerse más de rogar, se sentó en el tronco de una desmochada
encina, y, templando su rabel, de allí a poco, con muy buena gracia,
comenzó a cantar, diciendo desta manera:
Antonio
-Yo sé, Olalla, que me adoras,
puesto que no me lo has dicho
ni aun con los ojos siquiera,
mudas lenguas de amoríos.
Porque sé que eres sabida,
en que me quieres me afirmo;
que nunca fue desdichado
amor que fue conocido.
Bien es verdad que tal vez,
Olalla, me has dado indicio
que tienes de bronce el alma
y el blanco pecho de risco.
Mas allá entre tus reproches
y honestísimos desvíos,
tal vez la esperanza muestra
la orilla de su vestido.
Abalánzase al señuelo
mi fe, que nunca ha podido,
ni menguar por no llamado,
ni crecer por escogido.
Si el amor es cortesía,
de la que tienes colijo
que el fin de mis esperanzas
ha de ser cual imagino.
Y si son servicios parte
de hacer un pecho benigno,
algunos de los que he hecho
fortalecen mi partido.
Porque si has mirado en ello,
más de una vez habrás visto
que me he vestido en los lunes
lo que me honraba el domingo.
Como el amor y la gala
andan un mesmo camino,
en todo tiempo a tus ojos
quise mostrarme polido.
Dejo el bailar por tu causa,
ni las músicas te pinto
que has escuchado a deshoras
y al canto del gallo primo.
No cuento las alabanzas
que de tu belleza he dicho;
que, aunque verdaderas, hacen
ser yo de algunas malquisto.
Teresa del Berrocal,
yo alabándote, me dijo:
''Tal piensa que adora a un ángel,
y viene a adorar a un jimio;
merced a los muchos dijes
y a los cabellos postizos,
y a hipócritas hermosuras,
que engañan al Amor mismo''.
Desmentíla y enojóse;
volvió por ella su primo:
desafióme, y ya sabes
lo que yo hice y él hizo.
No te quiero yo a montón,
ni te pretendo y te sirvo
por lo de barraganía;
que más bueno es mi designio.
Coyundas tiene la Iglesia
que son lazadas de sirgo;
pon tú el cuello en la gamella;
verás como pongo el mío.
Donde no, desde aquí juro,
por el santo más bendito,
de no salir destas sierras
sino para capuchino.
Con esto dio el cabrero fin a su canto; y, aunque don Quijote le rogó que
algo más cantase, no lo consintió Sancho Panza, porque estaba más para
dormir que para oír canciones. Y ansí, dijo a su amo:
— Bien puede vuestra merced acomodarse desde luego adonde ha de posar esta
noche, que el trabajo que estos buenos hombres tienen todo el día no
permite que pasen las noches cantando.
— Ya te entiendo, Sancho —le respondió don Quijote—; que bien se me trasluce
que las visitas del zaque piden más recompensa de sueño que de música.
— A todos nos sabe bien, bendito sea Dios —respondió Sancho.
— No lo niego —replicó don Quijote—, pero acomódate tú donde quisieres, que
los de mi profesión mejor parecen velando que durmiendo. Pero, con todo
esto, sería bien, Sancho, que me vuelvas a curar esta oreja, que me va
doliendo más de lo que es menester.
Hizo Sancho lo que se le mandaba; y, viendo uno de los cabreros la herida,
le dijo que no tuviese pena, que él pondría remedio con que fácilmente se
sanase. Y, tomando algunas hojas de romero, de mucho que por allí había,
las mascó y las mezcló con un poco de sal, y, aplicándoselas a la oreja, se
la vendó muy bien, asegurándole que no había menester otra medicina; y así
fue la verdad.
Capítulo XII. De lo que contó un cabrero a los que estaban con don Quijote
Estando en esto, llegó otro mozo de los que les traían del aldea el
bastimento, y dijo:
— ¿Sabéis lo que pasa en el lugar, compañeros?
— ¿Cómo lo podemos saber? —respondió uno dellos.
— Pues sabed —prosiguió el mozo— que murió esta mañana aquel famoso pastor
estudiante llamado Grisóstomo, y se murmura que ha muerto de amores de
aquella endiablada moza de Marcela, la hija de Guillermo el rico, aquélla
que se anda en hábito de pastora por esos andurriales.
— Por Marcela dirás —dijo uno.
— Por ésa digo —respondió el cabrero—. Y es lo bueno, que mandó en su
testamento que le enterrasen en el campo, como si fuera moro, y que sea al
pie de la peña donde está la fuente del alcornoque; porque, según es fama,
y él dicen que lo dijo, aquel lugar es adonde él la vio la vez primera. Y
también mandó otras cosas, tales, que los abades del pueblo dicen que no se
han de cumplir, ni es bien que se cumplan, porque parecen de gentiles. A
todo lo cual responde aquel gran su amigo Ambrosio, el estudiante, que
también se vistió de pastor con él, que se ha de cumplir todo, sin faltar
nada, como lo dejó mandado Grisóstomo, y sobre esto anda el pueblo
alborotado; mas, a lo que se dice, en fin se hará lo que Ambrosio y todos
los pastores sus amigos quieren; y mañana le vienen a enterrar con gran
pompa adonde tengo dicho. Y tengo para mí que ha de ser cosa muy de ver; a
lo menos, yo no dejaré de ir a verla, si supiese no volver mañana al lugar.
— Todos haremos lo mesmo —respondieron los cabreros—; y echaremos suertes a
quién ha de quedar a guardar las cabras de todos.
— Bien dices, Pedro —dijo uno—; aunque no será menester usar de esa
diligencia, que yo me quedaré por todos. Y no lo atribuyas a virtud y a
poca curiosidad mía, sino a que no me deja andar el garrancho que el otro
día me pasó este pie.
— Con todo eso, te lo agradecemos —respondió Pedro.
Y don Quijote rogó a Pedro le dijese qué muerto era aquél y qué pastora
aquélla; a lo cual Pedro respondió que lo que sabía era que el muerto era
un hijodalgo rico, vecino de un lugar que estaba en aquellas sierras, el
cual había sido estudiante muchos años en Salamanca, al cabo de los cuales
había vuelto a su lugar, con opinión de muy sabio y muy leído.
— «Principalmente, decían que sabía la ciencia de las estrellas, y de lo que
pasan, allá en el cielo, el sol y la luna; porque puntualmente nos decía el
cris del sol y de la luna.»
— Eclipse se llama, amigo, que no cris, el escurecerse esos dos luminares
mayores —dijo don Quijote.
Mas Pedro, no reparando en niñerías, prosiguió su cuento diciendo:
— «Asimesmo adevinaba cuándo había de ser el año abundante o estil.»
— Estéril queréis decir, amigo —dijo don Quijote.
— Estéril o estil —respondió Pedro—, todo se sale allá. «Y digo que con esto
que decía se hicieron su padre y sus amigos, que le daban crédito, muy
ricos, porque hacían lo que él les aconsejaba, diciéndoles: ''Sembrad este
año cebada, no trigo; en éste podéis sembrar garbanzos y no cebada; el que
viene será de guilla de aceite; los tres siguientes no se cogerá gota''.»
— Esa ciencia se llama astrología —dijo don Quijote.
— No sé yo cómo se llama —replicó Pedro—, mas sé que todo esto sabía, y aún
más. «Finalmente, no pasaron muchos meses, después que vino de Salamanca,
cuando un día remaneció vestido de pastor, con su cayado y pellico,
habiéndose quitado los hábitos largos que como escolar traía; y juntamente
se vistió con él de pastor otro su grande amigo, llamado Ambrosio, que
había sido su compañero en los estudios. Olvidábaseme de decir como
Grisóstomo, el difunto, fue grande hombre de componer coplas; tanto, que él
hacía los villancicos para la noche del Nacimiento del Señor, y los autos
para el día de Dios, que los representaban los mozos de nuestro pueblo, y
todos decían que eran por el cabo. Cuando los del lugar vieron tan de
improviso vestidos de pastores a los dos escolares, quedaron admirados, y
no podían adivinar la causa que les había movido a hacer aquella tan
estraña mudanza. Ya en este tiempo era muerto el padre de nuestro
Grisóstomo, y él quedó heredado en mucha cantidad de hacienda, ansí en
muebles como en raíces, y en no pequeña cantidad de ganado, mayor y menor,
y en gran cantidad de dineros; de todo lo cual quedó el mozo señor
desoluto, y en verdad que todo lo merecía, que era muy buen compañero y
caritativo y amigo de los buenos, y tenía una cara como una bendición.
Después se vino a entender que el haberse mudado de traje no había sido por
otra cosa que por andarse por estos despoblados en pos de aquella pastora
Marcela que nuestro zagal nombró denantes, de la cual se había enamorado el
pobre difunto de Grisóstomo.» Y quiéroos decir agora, porque es bien que lo
sepáis, quién es esta rapaza; quizá, y aun sin quizá, no habréis oído
semejante cosa en todos los días de vuestra vida, aunque viváis más años
que sarna.
— Decid Sarra —replicó don Quijote, no pudiendo sufrir el trocar de los
vocablos del cabrero.
— Harto vive la sarna —respondió Pedro—; y si es, señor, que me habéis de
andar zaheriendo a cada paso los vocablos, no acabaremos en un año.
— Perdonad, amigo —dijo don Quijote—; que por haber tanta diferencia de
sarna a Sarra os lo dije; pero vos respondistes muy bien, porque vive más
sarna que Sarra; y proseguid vuestra historia, que no os replicaré más en
nada.
— «Digo, pues, señor mío de mi alma —dijo el cabrero—, que en nuestra aldea
hubo un labrador aún más rico que el padre de Grisóstomo, el cual se
llamaba Guillermo, y al cual dio Dios, amén de las muchas y grandes
riquezas, una hija, de cuyo parto murió su madre, que fue la más honrada
mujer que hubo en todos estos contornos. No parece sino que ahora la veo,
con aquella cara que del un cabo tenía el sol y del otro la luna; y, sobre
todo, hacendosa y amiga de los pobres, por lo que creo que debe de estar su
ánima a la hora de ahora gozando de Dios en el otro mundo. De pesar de la
muerte de tan buena mujer murió su marido Guillermo, dejando a su hija
Marcela, muchacha y rica, en poder de un tío suyo sacerdote y beneficiado
en nuestro lugar. Creció la niña con tanta belleza, que nos hacía acordar
de la de su madre, que la tuvo muy grande; y, con todo esto, se juzgaba que
le había de pasar la de la hija. Y así fue, que, cuando llegó a edad de
catorce a quince años, nadie la miraba que no bendecía a Dios, que tan
hermosa la había criado, y los más quedaban enamorados y perdidos por ella.
Guardábala su tío con mucho recato y con mucho encerramiento; pero, con
todo esto, la fama de su mucha hermosura se estendió de manera que, así por
ella como por sus muchas riquezas, no solamente de los de nuestro pueblo,
sino de los de muchas leguas a la redonda, y de los mejores dellos, era
rogado, solicitado e importunado su tío se la diese por mujer. Mas él, que
a las derechas es buen cristiano, aunque quisiera casarla luego, así como
la vía de edad, no quiso hacerlo sin su consentimiento, sin tener ojo a la
ganancia y granjería que le ofrecía el tener la hacienda de la moza,
dilatando su casamiento. Y a fe que se dijo esto en más de un corrillo en
el pueblo, en alabanza del buen sacerdote.» Que quiero que sepa, señor
andante, que en estos lugares cortos de todo se trata y de todo se murmura;
y tened para vos, como yo tengo para mí, que debía de ser demasiadamente
bueno el clérigo que obliga a sus feligreses a que digan bien dél,
especialmente en las aldeas.
— Así es la verdad —dijo don Quijote—, y proseguid adelante, que el cuento
es muy bueno, y vos, buen Pedro, le contáis con muy buena gracia.
— La del Señor no me falte, que es la que hace al caso. «Y en lo demás
sabréis que, aunque el tío proponía a la sobrina y le decía las calidades
de cada uno en particular, de los muchos que por mujer la pedían, rogándole
que se casase y escogiese a su gusto, jamás ella respondió otra cosa sino
que por entonces no quería casarse, y que, por ser tan muchacha, no se
sentía hábil para poder llevar la carga del matrimonio. Con estas que daba,
al parecer justas escusas, dejaba el tío de importunarla, y esperaba a que
entrase algo más en edad y ella supiese escoger compañía a su gusto. Porque
decía él, y decía muy bien, que no habían de dar los padres a sus hijos
estado contra su voluntad. Pero hételo aquí, cuando no me cato, que
remanece un día la melindrosa Marcela hecha pastora; y, sin ser parte su
tío ni todos los del pueblo, que se lo desaconsejaban, dio en irse al campo
con las demás zagalas del lugar, y dio en guardar su mesmo ganado. Y, así
como ella salió en público y su hermosura se vio al descubierto, no os
sabré buenamente decir cuántos ricos mancebos, hidalgos y labradores han
tomado el traje de Grisóstomo y la andan requebrando por esos campos. Uno
de los cuales, como ya está dicho, fue nuestro difunto, del cual decían que
la dejaba de querer, y la adoraba. Y no se piense que porque Marcela se
puso en aquella libertad y vida tan suelta y de tan poco o de ningún
recogimiento, que por eso ha dado indicio, ni por semejas, que venga en
menoscabo de su honestidad y recato; antes es tanta y tal la vigilancia con
que mira por su honra, que de cuantos la sirven y solicitan ninguno se ha
alabado, ni con verdad se podrá alabar, que le haya dado alguna pequeña
esperanza de alcanzar su deseo. Que, puesto que no huye ni se esquiva de la
compañía y conversación de los pastores, y los trata cortés y
amigablemente, en llegando a descubrirle su intención cualquiera dellos,
aunque sea tan justa y santa como la del matrimonio, los arroja de sí como
con un trabuco. Y con esta manera de condición hace más daño en esta tierra
que si por ella entrara la pestilencia; porque su afabilidad y hermosura
atrae los corazones de los que la tratan a servirla y a amarla, pero su
desdén y desengaño los conduce a términos de desesperarse; y así, no saben
qué decirle, sino llamarla a voces cruel y desagradecida, con otros títulos
a éste semejantes, que bien la calidad de su condición manifiestan. Y si
aquí estuviésedes, señor, algún día, veríades resonar estas sierras y estos
valles con los lamentos de los desengañados que la siguen. No está muy
lejos de aquí un sitio donde hay casi dos docenas de altas hayas, y no hay
ninguna que en su lisa corteza no tenga grabado y escrito el nombre de
Marcela; y encima de alguna, una corona grabada en el mesmo árbol, como si
más claramente dijera su amante que Marcela la lleva y la merece de toda la
hermosura humana. Aquí sospira un pastor, allí se queja otro; acullá se
oyen amorosas canciones, acá desesperadas endechas. Cuál hay que pasa todas
las horas de la noche sentado al pie de alguna encina o peñasco, y allí,
sin plegar los llorosos ojos, embebecido y transportado en sus
pensamientos, le halló el sol a la mañana; y cuál hay que, sin dar vado ni
tregua a sus suspiros, en mitad del ardor de la más enfadosa siesta del
verano, tendido sobre la ardiente arena, envía sus quejas al piadoso cielo.
Y déste y de aquél, y de aquéllos y de éstos, libre y desenfadadamente
triunfa la hermosa Marcela; y todos los que la conocemos estamos esperando
en qué ha de parar su altivez y quién ha de ser el dichoso que ha de venir
a domeñar condición tan terrible y gozar de hermosura tan estremada.» Por
ser todo lo que he contado tan averiguada verdad, me doy a entender que
también lo es la que nuestro zagal dijo que se decía de la causa de la
muerte de Grisóstomo. Y así, os aconsejo, señor, que no dejéis de hallaros
mañana a su entierro, que será muy de ver, porque Grisóstomo tiene muchos
amigos, y no está de este lugar a aquél donde manda enterrarse media legua.
— En cuidado me lo tengo —dijo don Quijote—, y agradézcoos el gusto que me
habéis dado con la narración de tan sabroso cuento.
— ¡Oh! —replicó el cabrero—, aún no sé yo la mitad de los casos sucedidos a
los amantes de Marcela, mas podría ser que mañana topásemos en el camino
algún pastor que nos los dijese. Y, por ahora, bien será que os vais a
dormir debajo de techado, porque el sereno os podría dañar la herida,
puesto que es tal la medicina que se os ha puesto, que no hay que temer de
contrario acidente.
Sancho Panza, que ya daba al diablo el tanto hablar del cabrero, solicitó,
por su parte, que su amo se entrase a dormir en la choza de Pedro. Hízolo
así, y todo lo más de la noche se le pasó en memorias de su señora
Dulcinea, a imitación de los amantes de Marcela. Sancho Panza se acomodó
entre Rocinante y su jumento, y durmió, no como enamorado desfavorecido,
sino como hombre molido a coces.
Capítulo XIII. Donde se da fin al cuento de la pastora Marcela, con otros
sucesos
Mas, apenas comenzó a descubrirse el día por los balcones del oriente,
cuando los cinco de los seis cabreros se levantaron y fueron a despertar a
don Quijote, y a decille si estaba todavía con propósito de ir a ver el
famoso entierro de Grisóstomo, y que ellos le harían compañía. Don Quijote,
que otra cosa no deseaba, se levantó y mandó a Sancho que ensillase y
enalbardase al momento, lo cual él hizo con mucha diligencia, y con la
mesma se pusieron luego todos en camino. Y no hubieron andado un cuarto de
legua, cuando, al cruzar de una senda, vieron venir hacia ellos hasta seis
pastores, vestidos con pellicos negros y coronadas las cabezas con
guirnaldas de ciprés y de amarga adelfa. Traía cada uno un grueso bastón de
acebo en la mano. Venían con ellos, asimesmo, dos gentiles hombres de a
caballo, muy bien aderezados de camino, con otros tres mozos de a pie que
los acompañaban. En llegándose a juntar, se saludaron cortésmente, y,
preguntándose los unos a los otros dónde iban, supieron que todos se
encaminaban al lugar del entierro; y así, comenzaron a caminar todos
juntos.
Uno de los de a caballo, hablando con su compañero, le dijo:
— Paréceme, señor Vivaldo, que habemos de dar por bien empleada la tardanza
que hiciéremos en ver este famoso entierro, que no podrá dejar de ser
famoso, según estos pastores nos han contado estrañezas, ansí del muerto
pastor como de la pastora homicida.
— Así me lo parece a mí —respondió Vivaldo—; y no digo yo hacer tardanza de
un día, pero de cuatro la hiciera a trueco de verle.
Preguntóles don Quijote qué era lo que habían oído de Marcela y de
Grisóstomo. El caminante dijo que aquella madrugada habían encontrado con
aquellos pastores, y que, por haberles visto en aquel tan triste traje, les
habían preguntado la ocasión por que iban de aquella manera; que uno dellos
se lo contó, contando la estrañeza y hermosura de una pastora llamada
Marcela, y los amores de muchos que la recuestaban, con la muerte de aquel
Grisóstomo a cuyo entierro iban. Finalmente, él contó todo lo que Pedro a
don Quijote había contado.
Cesó esta plática y comenzóse otra, preguntando el que se llamaba Vivaldo a
don Quijote qué era la ocasión que le movía a andar armado de aquella
manera por tierra tan pacífica. A lo cual respondió don Quijote:
— La profesión de mi ejercicio no consiente ni permite que yo ande de otra
manera. El buen paso, el regalo y el reposo, allá se inventó para los
blandos cortesanos; mas el trabajo, la inquietud y las armas sólo se
inventaron e hicieron para aquellos que el mundo llama caballeros andantes,
de los cuales yo, aunque indigno, soy el menor de todos.
Apenas le oyeron esto, cuando todos le tuvieron por loco; y, por
averiguarlo más y ver qué género de locura era el suyo, le tornó a
preguntar Vivaldo que qué quería decir "caballeros andantes".
— ¿No han vuestras mercedes leído —respondió don Quijote— los anales e
historias de Ingalaterra, donde se tratan las famosas fazañas del rey
Arturo, que continuamente en nuestro romance castellano llamamos el rey
Artús, de quien es tradición antigua y común en todo aquel reino de la Gran
Bretaña que este rey no murió, sino que, por arte de encantamento, se
convirtió en cuervo, y que, andando los tiempos, ha de volver a reinar y a
cobrar su reino y cetro; a cuya causa no se probará que desde aquel tiempo
a éste haya ningún inglés muerto cuervo alguno? Pues en tiempo de este buen
rey fue instituida aquella famosa orden de caballería de los caballeros de
la Tabla Redonda, y pasaron, sin faltar un punto, los amores que allí se
cuentan de don Lanzarote del Lago con la reina Ginebra, siendo medianera
dellos y sabidora aquella tan honrada dueña Quintañona, de donde nació
aquel tan sabido romance, y tan decantado en nuestra España, de:
Nunca fuera caballero
de damas tan bien servido
como fuera Lanzarote
cuando de Bretaña vino;
con aquel progreso tan dulce y tan suave de sus amorosos y fuertes fechos.
Pues desde entonces, de mano en mano, fue aquella orden de caballería
estendiéndose y dilatándose por muchas y diversas partes del mundo; y en
ella fueron famosos y conocidos por sus fechos el valiente Amadís de Gaula,
con todos sus hijos y nietos, hasta la quinta generación, y el valeroso
Felixmarte de Hircania, y el nunca como se debe alabado Tirante el Blanco,
y casi que en nuestros días vimos y comunicamos y oímos al invencible y
valeroso caballero don Belianís de Grecia. Esto, pues, señores, es ser
caballero andante, y la que he dicho es la orden de su caballería; en la
cual, como otra vez he dicho, yo, aunque pecador, he hecho profesión, y lo
mesmo que profesaron los caballeros referidos profeso yo. Y así, me voy por
estas soledades y despoblados buscando las aventuras, con ánimo deliberado
de ofrecer mi brazo y mi persona a la más peligrosa que la suerte me
deparare, en ayuda de los flacos y menesterosos.
Por estas razones que dijo, acabaron de enterarse los caminantes que era
don Quijote falto de juicio, y del género de locura que lo señoreaba, de lo
cual recibieron la mesma admiración que recibían todos aquellos que de
nuevo venían en conocimiento della. Y Vivaldo, que era persona muy discreta
y de alegre condición, por pasar sin pesadumbre el poco camino que decían
que les faltaba, al llegar a la sierra del entierro, quiso darle ocasión a
que pasase más adelante con sus disparates. Y así, le dijo:
— Paréceme, señor caballero andante, que vuestra merced ha profesado una de
las más estrechas profesiones que hay en la tierra, y tengo para mí que aun
la de los frailes cartujos no es tan estrecha.
— Tan estrecha bien podía ser —respondió nuestro don Quijote—, pero tan
necesaria en el mundo no estoy en dos dedos de ponello en duda. Porque, si
va a decir verdad, no hace menos el soldado que pone en ejecución lo que su
capitán le manda que el mesmo capitán que se lo ordena. Quiero decir que
los religiosos, con toda paz y sosiego, piden al cielo el bien de la
tierra; pero los soldados y caballeros ponemos en ejecución lo que ellos
piden, defendiéndola con el valor de nuestros brazos y filos de nuestras
espadas; no debajo de cubierta, sino al cielo abierto, puestos por blanco
de los insufribles rayos del sol en verano y de los erizados yelos del
invierno. Así que, somos ministros de Dios en la tierra, y brazos por quien
se ejecuta en ella su justicia. Y, como las cosas de la guerra y las a
ellas tocantes y concernientes no se pueden poner en ejecución sino
sudando, afanando y trabajando, síguese que aquellos que la profesan
tienen, sin duda, mayor trabajo que aquellos que en sosegada paz y reposo
están rogando a Dios favorezca a los que poco pueden. No quiero yo decir,
ni me pasa por pensamiento, que es tan buen estado el de caballero andante
como el del encerrado religioso; sólo quiero inferir, por lo que yo
padezco, que, sin duda, es más trabajoso y más aporreado, y más hambriento
y sediento, miserable, roto y piojoso; porque no hay duda sino que los
caballeros andantes pasados pasaron mucha malaventura en el discurso de su
vida. Y si algunos subieron a ser emperadores por el valor de su brazo, a
fe que les costó buen porqué de su sangre y de su sudor; y que si a los que
a tal grado subieron les faltaran encantadores y sabios que los ayudaran,
que ellos quedaran bien defraudados de sus deseos y bien engañados de sus
esperanzas.
— De ese parecer estoy yo —replicó el caminante—; pero una cosa, entre otras
muchas, me parece muy mal de los caballeros andantes, y es que, cuando se
ven en ocasión de acometer una grande y peligrosa aventura, en que se vee
manifiesto peligro de perder la vida, nunca en aquel instante de acometella
se acuerdan de encomendarse a Dios, como cada cristiano está obligado a
hacer en peligros semejantes; antes, se encomiendan a sus damas, con tanta
gana y devoción como si ellas fueran su Dios: cosa que me parece que huele
algo a gentilidad.
— Señor —respondió don Quijote—, eso no puede ser menos en ninguna manera, y
caería en mal caso el caballero andante que otra cosa hiciese; que ya está
en uso y costumbre en la caballería andantesca que el caballero andante
que, al acometer algún gran fecho de armas, tuviese su señora
delante,vuelva a ella los ojos blanda y amorosamente, como que le pide con
ellos le favorezca y ampare en el dudoso trance que acomete; y aun si nadie
le oye, está obligado a decir algunas palabras entre dientes, en que de
todo corazón se le encomiende; y desto tenemos innumerables ejemplos en las
historias. Y no se ha de entender por esto que han de dejar de encomendarse
a Dios; que tiempo y lugar les queda para hacerlo en el discurso de la
obra.
— Con todo eso —replicó el caminante—, me queda un escrúpulo, y es que
muchas veces he leído que se traban palabras entre dos andantes caballeros,
y, de una en otra, se les viene a encender la cólera, y a volver los
caballos y tomar una buena pieza del campo, y luego, sin más ni más, a todo
el correr dellos, se vuelven a encontrar; y, en mitad de la corrida, se
encomiendan a sus damas; y lo que suele suceder del encuentro es que el uno
cae por las ancas del caballo, pasado con la lanza del contrario de parte a
parte, y al otro le viene también que, a no tenerse a las crines del suyo,
no pudiera dejar de venir al suelo. Y no sé yo cómo el muerto tuvo lugar
para encomendarse a Dios en el discurso de esta tan acelerada obra. Mejor
fuera que las palabras que en la carrera gastó encomendándose a su dama las
gastara en lo que debía y estaba obligado como cristiano. Cuanto más, que
yo tengo para mí que no todos los caballeros andantes tienen damas a quien
encomendarse, porque no todos son enamorados.
— Eso no puede ser —respondió don Quijote—: digo que no puede ser que haya
caballero andante sin dama, porque tan proprio y tan natural les es a los
tales ser enamorados como al cielo tener estrellas, y a buen seguro que no
se haya visto historia donde se halle caballero andante sin amores; y por
el mesmo caso que estuviese sin ellos, no sería tenido por legítimo
caballero, sino por bastardo, y que entró en la fortaleza de la caballería
dicha, no por la puerta, sino por las bardas, como salteador y ladrón.
— Con todo eso —dijo el caminante—, me parece, si mal no me acuerdo, haber
leído que don Galaor, hermano del valeroso Amadís de Gaula, nunca tuvo dama
señalada a quien pudiese encomendarse; y, con todo esto, no fue tenido en
menos, y fue un muy valiente y famoso caballero.
A lo cual respondió nuestro don Quijote:
— Señor, una golondrina sola no hace verano. Cuanto más, que yo sé que de
secreto estaba ese caballero muy bien enamorado; fuera que, aquello de
querer a todas bien cuantas bien le parecían era condición natural, a quien
no podía ir a la mano. Pero, en resolución, averiguado está muy bien que él
tenía una sola a quien él había hecho señora de su voluntad, a la cual se
encomendaba muy a menudo y muy secretamente, porque se preció de secreto
caballero.
— Luego, si es de esencia que todo caballero andante haya de ser enamorado
— dijo el caminante—, bien se puede creer que vuestra merced lo es, pues es
de la profesión. Y si es que vuestra merced no se precia de ser tan secreto
como don Galaor, con las veras que puedo le suplico, en nombre de toda esta
compañía y en el mío, nos diga el nombre, patria, calidad y hermosura de su
dama; que ella se tendría por dichosa de que todo el mundo sepa que es
querida y servida de un tal caballero como vuestra merced parece.
Aquí dio un gran suspiro don Quijote, y dijo:
— Yo no podré afirmar si la dulce mi enemiga gusta, o no, de que el mundo
sepa que yo la sirvo; sólo sé decir, respondiendo a lo que con tanto
comedimiento se me pide, que su nombre es Dulcinea; su patria, el Toboso,
un lugar de la Mancha; su calidad, por lo menos, ha de ser de princesa,
pues es reina y señora mía; su hermosura, sobrehumana, pues en ella se
vienen a hacer verdaderos todos los imposibles y quiméricos atributos de
belleza que los poetas dan a sus damas: que sus cabellos son oro, su frente
campos elíseos, sus cejas arcos del cielo, sus ojos soles, sus mejillas
rosas, sus labios corales, perlas sus dientes, alabastro su cuello, mármol
su pecho, marfil sus manos, su blancura nieve, y las partes que a la vista
humana encubrió la honestidad son tales, según yo pienso y entiendo, que
sólo la discreta consideración puede encarecerlas, y no compararlas.
— El linaje, prosapia y alcurnia querríamos saber —replicó Vivaldo.
A lo cual respondió don Quijote:
— No es de los antiguos Curcios, Gayos y Cipiones romanos, ni de los
modernos Colonas y Ursinos; ni de los Moncadas y Requesenes de Cataluña, ni
menos de los Rebellas y Villanovas de Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas,
Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas, Alagones, Urreas, Foces y Gurreas de Aragón;
Cerdas, Manriques, Mendozas y Guzmanes de Castilla; Alencastros, Pallas y
Meneses de Portogal; pero es de los del Toboso de la Mancha, linaje, aunque
moderno, tal, que puede dar generoso principio a las más ilustres familias
de los venideros siglos. Y no se me replique en esto, si no fuere con las
condiciones que puso Cervino al pie del trofeo de las armas de Orlando, que
decía:
nadie las mueva
que estar no pueda con Roldán a prueba.
— Aunque el mío es de los Cachopines de Laredo —respondió el caminante—, no
le osaré yo poner con el del Toboso de la Mancha, puesto que, para decir
verdad, semejante apellido hasta ahora no ha llegado a mis oídos.
— ¡Como eso no habrá llegado! —replicó don Quijote.
Con gran atención iban escuchando todos los demás la plática de los dos, y
aun hasta los mesmos cabreros y pastores conocieron la demasiada falta de
juicio de nuestro don Quijote. Sólo Sancho Panza pensaba que cuanto su amo
decía era verdad, sabiendo él quién era y habiéndole conocido desde su
nacimiento; y en lo que dudaba algo era en creer aquello de la linda
Dulcinea del Toboso, porque nunca tal nombre ni tal princesa había llegado
jamás a su noticia, aunque vivía tan cerca del Toboso.
En estas pláticas iban, cuando vieron que, por la quiebra que dos altas
montañas hacían, bajaban hasta veinte pastores, todos con pellicos de negra
lana vestidos y coronados con guirnaldas, que, a lo que después pareció,
eran cuál de tejo y cuál de ciprés. Entre seis dellos traían unas andas,
cubiertas de mucha diversidad de flores y de ramos. Lo cual visto por uno
de los cabreros, dijo:
— Aquellos que allí vienen son los que traen el cuerpo de Grisóstomo, y el
pie de aquella montaña es el lugar donde él mandó que le enterrasen.
Por esto se dieron priesa a llegar, y fue a tiempo que ya los que venían
habían puesto las andas en el suelo; y cuatro dellos con agudos picos
estaban cavando la sepultura a un lado de una dura peña.
Recibiéronse los unos y los otros cortésmente; y luego don Quijote y los
que con él venían se pusieron a mirar las andas, y en ellas vieron cubierto
de flores un cuerpo muerto, vestido como pastor, de edad, al parecer, de
treinta años; y, aunque muerto, mostraba que vivo había sido de rostro
hermoso y de disposición gallarda. Alrededor dél tenía en las mesmas
andas algunos libros y muchos papeles, abiertos y cerrados. Y así los que
esto miraban, como los que abrían la sepultura, y todos los demás que allí
había, guardaban un maravilloso silencio, hasta que uno de los que al
muerto trujeron dijo a otro:
— Mirá bien, Ambrosio, si es éste el lugar que Grisóstomo dijo, ya que
queréis que tan puntualmente se cumpla lo que dejó mandado en su
testamento.
— Éste es —respondió Ambrosio—; que muchas veces en él me contó mi
desdichado amigo la historia de su desventura. Allí me dijo él que vio la
vez primera a aquella enemiga mortal del linaje humano, y allí fue también
donde la primera vez le declaró su pensamiento, tan honesto como enamorado,
y allí fue la última vez donde Marcela le acabó de desengañar y desdeñar,
de suerte que puso fin a la tragedia de su miserable vida. Y aquí, en
memoria de tantas desdichas, quiso él que le depositasen en las entrañas
del eterno olvido.
Y, volviéndose a don Quijote y a los caminantes, prosiguió diciendo:
— Ese cuerpo, señores, que con piadosos ojos estáis mirando, fue depositario
de un alma en quien el cielo puso infinita parte de sus riquezas. Ése es el
cuerpo de Grisóstomo, que fue único en el ingenio, solo en la cortesía,
estremo en la gentileza, fénix en la amistad, magnífico sin tasa, grave sin
presunción, alegre sin bajeza, y, finalmente, primero en todo lo que es ser
bueno, y sin segundo en todo lo que fue ser desdichado. Quiso bien, fue
aborrecido; adoró, fue desdeñado; rogó a una fiera, importunó a un mármol,
corrió tras el viento, dio voces a la soledad, sirvió a la ingratitud, de
quien alcanzó por premio ser despojos de la muerte en la mitad de la
carrera de su vida, a la cual dio fin una pastora a quien él procuraba
eternizar para que viviera en la memoria de las gentes, cual lo pudieran
mostrar bien esos papeles que estáis mirando, si él no me hubiera mandado
que los entregara al fuego en habiendo entregado su cuerpo a la tierra.
— De mayor rigor y crueldad usaréis vos con ellos —dijo Vivaldo— que su
mesmo dueño, pues no es justo ni acertado que se cumpla la voluntad de
quien lo que ordena va fuera de todo razonable discurso. Y no le tuviera
bueno Augusto César si consintiera que se pusiera en ejecución lo que el
divino Mantuano dejó en su testamento mandado. Ansí que, señor Ambrosio, ya
que deis el cuerpo de vuestro amigo a la tierra, no queráis dar sus
escritos al olvido; que si él ordenó como agraviado, no es bien que vos
cumpláis como indiscreto. Antes haced, dando la vida a estos papeles, que
la tenga siempre la crueldad de Marcela, para que sirva de ejemplo, en los
tiempos que están por venir, a los vivientes, para que se aparten y huyan
de caer en semejantes despeñaderos; que ya sé yo, y los que aquí venimos,
la historia deste vuestro enamorado y desesperado amigo, y sabemos la
amistad vuestra, y la ocasión de su muerte, y lo que dejó mandado al acabar
de la vida; de la cual lamentable historia se puede sacar cuánto haya sido
la crueldad de Marcela, el amor de Grisóstomo, la fe de la amistad vuestra,
con el paradero que tienen los que a rienda suelta corren por la senda que
el desvariado amor delante de los ojos les pone. Anoche supimos la muerte
de Grisóstomo, y que en este lugar había de ser enterrado; y así, de
curiosidad y de lástima, dejamos nuestro derecho viaje, y acordamos de
venir a ver con los ojos lo que tanto nos había lastimado en oíllo. Y, en
pago desta lástima y del deseo que en nosotros nació de remedialla si
pudiéramos, te rogamos, ¡oh discreto Ambrosio! (a lo menos, yo te lo
suplico de mi parte), que, dejando de abrasar estos papeles, me dejes
llevar algunos dellos.
Y, sin aguardar que el pastor respondiese, alargó la mano y tomó algunos de
los que más cerca estaban; viendo lo cual Ambrosio, dijo:
— Por cortesía consentiré que os quedéis, señor, con los que ya habéis
tomado; pero pensar que dejaré de abrasar los que quedan es pensamiento
vano.
Vivaldo, que deseaba ver lo que los papeles decían, abrió luego el uno
dellos y vio que tenía por título: Canción desesperada. Oyólo Ambrosio y
dijo:
— Ése es el último papel que escribió el desdichado; y, porque veáis, señor,
en el término que le tenían sus desventuras, leelde de modo que seáis oído;
que bien os dará lugar a ello el que se tardare en abrir la sepultura.
— Eso haré yo de muy buena gana —dijo Vivaldo.
Y, como todos los circunstantes tenían el mesmo deseo, se le pusieron a la
redonda; y él, leyendo en voz clara, vio que así decía:
Capítulo XIV. Donde se ponen los versos desesperados del difunto pastor,
con otros no esperados sucesos
Canción de Grisóstomo
Ya que quieres, cruel, que se publique,
de lengua en lengua y de una en otra gente,
del áspero rigor tuyo la fuerza,
haré que el mesmo infierno comunique
al triste pecho mío un son doliente,
con que el uso común de mi voz tuerza.
Y al par de mi deseo, que se esfuerza
a decir mi dolor y tus hazañas,
de la espantable voz irá el acento,
y en él mezcladas, por mayor tormento,
pedazos de las míseras entrañas.
Escucha, pues, y presta atento oído,
no al concertado son, sino al rüido
que de lo hondo de mi amargo pecho,
llevado de un forzoso desvarío,
por gusto mío sale y tu despecho.
El rugir del león, del lobo fiero
el temeroso aullido, el silbo horrendo
de escamosa serpiente, el espantable
baladro de algún monstruo, el agorero
graznar de la corneja, y el estruendo
del viento contrastado en mar instable;
del ya vencido toro el implacable
bramido, y de la viuda tortolilla
el sentible arrullar; el triste canto
del envidiado búho, con el llanto
de toda la infernal negra cuadrilla,
salgan con la doliente ánima fuera,
mezclados en un son, de tal manera
que se confundan los sentidos todos,
pues la pena cruel que en mí se halla
para contalla pide nuevos modos.
De tanta confusión no las arenas
del padre Tajo oirán los tristes ecos,
ni del famoso Betis las olivas:
que allí se esparcirán mis duras penas
en altos riscos y en profundos huecos,
con muerta lengua y con palabras vivas;
o ya en escuros valles, o en esquivas
playas, desnudas de contrato humano,
o adonde el sol jamás mostró su lumbre,
o entre la venenosa muchedumbre
de fieras que alimenta el libio llano;
que, puesto que en los páramos desiertos
los ecos roncos de mi mal, inciertos,
suenen con tu rigor tan sin segundo,
por privilegio de mis cortos hados,
serán llevados por el ancho mundo.
Mata un desdén, atierra la paciencia,
o verdadera o falsa, una sospecha;
matan los celos con rigor más fuerte;
desconcierta la vida larga ausencia;
contra un temor de olvido no aprovecha
firme esperanza de dichosa suerte.
En todo hay cierta, inevitable muerte;
mas yo, ¡milagro nunca visto!, vivo
celoso, ausente, desdeñado y cierto
de las sospechas que me tienen muerto;
y en el olvido en quien mi fuego avivo,
y, entre tantos tormentos, nunca alcanza
mi vista a ver en sombra a la esperanza,
ni yo, desesperado, la procuro;
antes, por estremarme en mi querella,
estar sin ella eternamente juro.
¿Puédese, por ventura, en un instante
esperar y temer, o es bien hacello,
siendo las causas del temor más ciertas?
¿Tengo, si el duro celo está delante,
de cerrar estos ojos, si he de vello
por mil heridas en el alma abiertas?
¿Quién no abrirá de par en par las puertas
a la desconfianza, cuando mira
descubierto el desdén, y las sospechas,
¡oh amarga conversión!, verdades hechas,
y la limpia verdad vuelta en mentira?
¡Oh, en el reino de amor fieros tiranos
celos, ponedme un hierro en estas manos!
Dame, desdén, una torcida soga.
Mas, ¡ay de mí!, que, con cruel vitoria,
vuestra memoria el sufrimiento ahoga.
Yo muero, en fin; y, porque nunca espere
buen suceso en la muerte ni en la vida,
pertinaz estaré en mi fantasía.
Diré que va acertado el que bien quiere,
y que es más libre el alma más rendida
a la de amor antigua tiranía.
Diré que la enemiga siempre mía
hermosa el alma como el cuerpo tiene,
y que su olvido de mi culpa nace,
y que, en fe de los males que nos hace,
amor su imperio en justa paz mantiene.
Y, con esta opinión y un duro lazo,
acelerando el miserable plazo
a que me han conducido sus desdenes,
ofreceré a los vientos cuerpo y alma,
sin lauro o palma de futuros bienes.
Tú, que con tantas sinrazones muestras
la razón que me fuerza a que la haga
a la cansada vida que aborrezco,
pues ya ves que te da notorias muestras
esta del corazón profunda llaga,
de cómo, alegre, a tu rigor me ofrezco,
si, por dicha, conoces que merezco
que el cielo claro de tus bellos ojos
en mi muerte se turbe, no lo hagas;
que no quiero que en nada satisfagas,
al darte de mi alma los despojos.
Antes, con risa en la ocasión funesta,
descubre que el fin mío fue tu fiesta;
mas gran simpleza es avisarte desto,
pues sé que está tu gloria conocida
en que mi vida llegue al fin tan presto.
Venga, que es tiempo ya, del hondo abismo
Tántalo con su sed; Sísifo venga
con el peso terrible de su canto;
Ticio traya su buitre, y ansimismo
con su rueda Egïón no se detenga,
ni las hermanas que trabajan tanto;
y todos juntos su mortal quebranto
trasladen en mi pecho, y en voz baja
-si ya a un desesperado son debidas-
canten obsequias tristes, doloridas,
al cuerpo a quien se niegue aun la mortaja.
Y el portero infernal de los tres rostros,
con otras mil quimeras y mil monstros,
lleven el doloroso contrapunto;
que otra pompa mejor no me parece
que la merece un amador difunto.
Canción desesperada, no te quejes
cuando mi triste compañía dejes;
antes, pues que la causa do naciste
con mi desdicha augmenta su ventura,
aun en la sepultura no estés triste.
Bien les pareció, a los que escuchado habían, la canción de Grisóstomo,
puesto que el que la leyó dijo que no le parecía que conformaba con la
relación que él había oído del recato y bondad de Marcela, porque en ella
se quejaba Grisóstomo de celos, sospechas y de ausencia, todo en perjuicio
del buen crédito y buena fama de Marcela. A lo cual respondió Ambrosio,
como aquel que sabía bien los más escondidos pensamientos de su amigo:
— Para que, señor, os satisfagáis desa duda, es bien que sepáis que cuando
este desdichado escribió esta canción estaba ausente de Marcela, de quien
él se había ausentado por su voluntad, por ver si usaba con él la ausencia
de sus ordinarios fueros. Y, como al enamorado ausente no hay cosa que no
le fatigue ni temor que no le dé alcance, así le fatigaban a Grisóstomo los
celos imaginados y las sospechas temidas como si fueran verdaderas. Y con
esto queda en su punto la verdad que la fama pregona de la bondad de
Marcela; la cual, fuera de ser cruel, y un poco arrogante y un mucho
desdeñosa, la mesma envidia ni debe ni puede ponerle falta alguna.
— Así es la verdad —respondió Vivaldo.
Y, queriendo leer otro papel de los que había reservado del fuego, lo
estorbó una maravillosa visión —que tal parecía ella— que improvisamente se
les ofreció a los ojos; y fue que, por cima de la peña donde se cavaba la
sepultura, pareció la pastora Marcela, tan hermosa que pasaba a su fama su
hermosura. Los que hasta entonces no la habían visto la miraban con
admiración y silencio, y los que ya estaban acostumbrados a verla no
quedaron menos suspensos que los que nunca la habían visto. Mas, apenas la
hubo visto Ambrosio, cuando, con muestras de ánimo indignado, le dijo:
— ¿Vienes a ver, por ventura, ¡oh fiero basilisco destas montañas!, si con
tu presencia vierten sangre las heridas deste miserable a quien tu crueldad
quitó la vida? ¿O vienes a ufanarte en las crueles hazañas de tu condición,
o a ver desde esa altura, como otro despiadado Nero, el incendio de su
abrasada Roma, o a pisar, arrogante, este desdichado cadáver, como la
ingrata hija al de su padre Tarquino? Dinos presto a lo que vienes, o qué
es aquello de que más gustas; que, por saber yo que los pensamientos de
Grisóstomo jamás dejaron de obedecerte en vida, haré que, aun él muerto, te
obedezcan los de todos aquellos que se llamaron sus amigos.
— No vengo, ¡oh Ambrosio!, a ninguna cosa de las que has dicho —respondió
Marcela—, sino a volver por mí misma, y a dar a entender cuán fuera de
razón van todos aquellos que de sus penas y de la muerte de Grisóstomo me
culpan; y así, ruego a todos los que aquí estáis me estéis atentos, que no
será menester mucho tiempo ni gastar muchas palabras para persuadir una
verdad a los discretos.
»Hízome el cielo, según vosotros decís, hermosa, y de tal manera que, sin
ser poderosos a otra cosa, a que me améis os mueve mi hermosura; y, por el
amor que me mostráis, decís, y aun queréis, que esté yo obligada a amaros.
Yo conozco, con el natural entendimiento que Dios me ha dado, que todo lo
hermoso es amable; mas no alcanzo que, por razón de ser amado, esté
obligado lo que es amado por hermoso a amar a quien le ama. Y más, que
podría acontecer que el amador de lo hermoso fuese feo, y, siendo lo feo
digno de ser aborrecido, cae muy mal el decir ''Quiérote por hermosa; hasme
de amar aunque sea feo''. Pero, puesto caso que corran igualmente las
hermosuras, no por eso han de correr iguales los deseos, que no todas
hermosuras enamoran; que algunas alegran la vista y no rinden la voluntad;
que si todas las bellezas enamorasen y rindiesen, sería un andar las
voluntades confusas y descaminadas, sin saber en cuál habían de parar;
porque, siendo infinitos los sujetos hermosos, infinitos habían de ser los
deseos. Y, según yo he oído decir, el verdadero amor no se divide, y ha de
ser voluntario, y no forzoso. Siendo esto así, como yo creo que lo es, ¿por
qué queréis que rinda mi voluntad por fuerza, obligada no más de que decís
que me queréis bien? Si no, decidme: si como el cielo me hizo hermosa me
hiciera fea, ¿fuera justo que me quejara de vosotros porque no me amábades?
Cuanto más, que habéis de considerar que yo no escogí la hermosura que
tengo; que, tal cual es, el cielo me la dio de gracia, sin yo pedilla ni
escogella. Y, así como la víbora no merece ser culpada por la ponzoña que
tiene, puesto que con ella mata, por habérsela dado naturaleza, tampoco yo
merezco ser reprehendida por ser hermosa; que la hermosura en la mujer
honesta es como el fuego apartado o como la espada aguda, que ni él quema
ni ella corta a quien a ellos no se acerca. La honra y las virtudes son
adornos del alma, sin las cuales el cuerpo, aunque lo sea, no debe de
parecer hermoso. Pues si la honestidad es una de las virtudes que al cuerpo
y al alma más adornan y hermosean, ¿por qué la ha de perder la que es amada
por hermosa, por corresponder a la intención de aquel que, por sólo su
gusto, con todas sus fuerzas e industrias procura que la pierda?
»Yo nací libre, y para poder vivir libre escogí la soledad de los campos.
Los árboles destas montañas son mi compañía, las claras aguas destos
arroyos mis espejos; con los árboles y con las aguas comunico mis
pensamientos y hermosura. Fuego soy apartado y espada puesta lejos. A los
que he enamorado con la vista he desengañado con las palabras. Y si los
deseos se sustentan con esperanzas, no habiendo yo dado alguna a Grisóstomo
ni a otro alguno, el fin de ninguno dellos bien se puede decir que antes le
mató su porfía que mi crueldad. Y si se me hace cargo que eran honestos sus
pensamientos, y que por esto estaba obligada a corresponder a ellos, digo
que, cuando en ese mismo lugar donde ahora se cava su sepultura me
descubrió la bondad de su intención, le dije yo que la mía era vivir en
perpetua soledad, y de que sola la tierra gozase el fruto de mi
recogimiento y los despojos de mi hermosura; y si él, con todo este
desengaño, quiso porfiar contra la esperanza y navegar contra el viento,
¿qué mucho que se anegase en la mitad del golfo de su desatino? Si yo le
entretuviera, fuera falsa; si le contentara, hiciera contra mi mejor
intención y prosupuesto. Porfió desengañado, desesperó sin ser aborrecido:
¡mirad ahora si será razón que de su pena se me dé a mí la culpa! Quéjese
el engañado, desespérese aquel a quien le faltaron las prometidas
esperanzas, confíese el que yo llamare, ufánese el que yo admitiere; pero
no me llame cruel ni homicida aquel a quien yo no prometo, engaño, llamo ni
admito.
»El cielo aún hasta ahora no ha querido que yo ame por destino, y el pensar
que tengo de amar por elección es escusado. Este general desengaño sirva a
cada uno de los que me solicitan de su particular provecho; y entiéndase,
de aquí adelante, que si alguno por mí muriere, no muere de celoso ni
desdichado, porque quien a nadie quiere, a ninguno debe dar celos; que los
desengaños no se han de tomar en cuenta de desdenes. El que me llama fiera
y basilisco, déjeme como cosa perjudicial y mala; el que me llama ingrata,
no me sirva; el que desconocida, no me conozca; quien cruel, no me siga;
que esta fiera, este basilisco, esta ingrata, esta cruel y esta
desconocida, ni los buscará, servirá, conocerá ni seguirá en ninguna
manera. Que si a Grisóstomo mató su impaciencia y arrojado deseo, ¿por qué
se ha de culpar mi honesto proceder y recato? Si yo conservo mi limpieza
con la compañía de los árboles, ¿por qué ha de querer que la pierda el que
quiere que la tenga con los hombres? Yo, como sabéis, tengo riquezas
propias y no codicio las ajenas; tengo libre condición y no gusto de
sujetarme: ni quiero ni aborrezco a nadie. No engaño a éste ni solicito
aquél, ni burlo con uno ni me entretengo con el otro. La conversación
honesta de las zagalas destas aldeas y el cuidado de mis cabras me
entretiene. Tienen mis deseos por término estas montañas, y si de aquí
salen, es a contemplar la hermosura del cielo, pasos con que camina el alma
a su morada primera.
Y, en diciendo esto, sin querer oír respuesta alguna, volvió las espaldas y
se entró por lo más cerrado de un monte que allí cerca estaba, dejando
admirados, tanto de su discreción como de su hermosura, a todos los que
allí estaban. Y algunos dieron muestras —de aquellos que de la poderosa
flecha de los rayos de sus bellos ojos estaban heridos— de quererla seguir,
sin aprovecharse del manifiesto desengaño que habían oído. Lo cual visto
por don Quijote, pareciéndole que allí venía bien usar de su caballería,
socorriendo a las doncellas menesterosas, puesta la mano en el puño de su
espada, en altas e inteligibles voces, dijo:
— Ninguna persona, de cualquier estado y condición que sea, se atreva a
seguir a la hermosa Marcela, so pena de caer en la furiosa indignación mía.
Ella ha mostrado con claras y suficientes razones la poca o ninguna culpa
que ha tenido en la muerte de Grisóstomo, y cuán ajena vive de condescender
con los deseos de ninguno de sus amantes, a cuya causa es justo que, en
lugar de ser seguida y perseguida, sea honrada y estimada de todos los
buenos del mundo, pues muestra que en él ella es sola la que con tan
honesta intención vive.
O ya que fuese por las amenazas de don Quijote, o porque Ambrosio les dijo
que concluyesen con lo que a su buen amigo debían, ninguno de los pastores
se movió ni apartó de allí hasta que, acabada la sepultura y abrasados los
papeles de Grisóstomo, pusieron su cuerpo en ella, no sin muchas lágrimas
de los circunstantes. Cerraron la sepultura con una gruesa peña, en tanto
que se acababa una losa que, según Ambrosio dijo, pensaba mandar hacer, con
un epitafio que había de decir desta manera:
Yace aquí de un amador
el mísero cuerpo helado,
que fue pastor de ganado,
perdido por desamor.
Murió a manos del rigor
de una esquiva hermosa ingrata,
con quien su imperio dilata
la tiranía de su amor.
Luego esparcieron por cima de la sepultura muchas flores y ramos, y, dando
todos el pésame a su amigo Ambrosio, se despidieron dél. Lo mesmo hicieron
Vivaldo y su compañero, y don Quijote se despidió de sus huéspedes y de los
caminantes, los cuales le rogaron se viniese con ellos a Sevilla, por ser
lugar tan acomodado a hallar aventuras, que en cada calle y tras cada
esquina se ofrecen más que en otro alguno. Don Quijote les agradeció el
aviso y el ánimo que mostraban de hacerle merced, y dijo que por entonces
no quería ni debía ir a Sevilla, hasta que hubiese despojado todas aquellas
sierras de ladrones malandrines, de quien era fama que todas estaban
llenas. Viendo su buena determinación, no quisieron los caminantes
importunarle más, sino, tornándose a despedir de nuevo, le dejaron y
prosiguieron su camino, en el cual no les faltó de qué tratar, así de la
historia de Marcela y Grisóstomo como de las locuras de don Quijote. El
cual determinó de ir a buscar a la pastora Marcela y ofrecerle todo lo que
él podía en su servicio. Mas no le avino como él pensaba, según se cuenta
en el discurso desta verdadera historia, dando aquí fin la segunda parte.
Tercera parte del ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha
Capítulo XV. Donde se cuenta la desgraciada aventura que se topó don
Quijote en topar con unos desalmados yangüeses
Cuenta el sabio Cide Hamete Benengeli que, así como don Quijote se despidió
de sus huéspedes y de todos los que se hallaron al entierro del pastor
Grisóstomo, él y su escudero se entraron por el mesmo bosque donde vieron
que se había entrado la pastora Marcela; y, habiendo andado más de dos
horas por él, buscándola por todas partes sin poder hallarla, vinieron a
parar a un prado lleno de fresca yerba, junto del cual corría un arroyo
apacible y fresco; tanto, que convidó y forzó a pasar allí las horas de la
siesta, que rigurosamente comenzaba ya a entrar.
Apeáronse don Quijote y Sancho, y, dejando al jumento y a Rocinante a sus
anchuras pacer de la mucha yerba que allí había, dieron saco a las
alforjas, y, sin cerimonia alguna, en buena paz y compañía, amo y mozo
comieron lo que en ellas hallaron.
No se había curado Sancho de echar sueltas a Rocinante, seguro de que le
conocía por tan manso y tan poco rijoso que todas las yeguas de la dehesa
de Córdoba no le hicieran tomar mal siniestro. Ordenó, pues, la suerte, y
el diablo, que no todas veces duerme, que andaban por aquel valle paciendo
una manada de hacas galicianas de unos arrieros gallegos, de los cuales es
costumbre sestear con su recua en lugares y sitios de yerba y agua; y aquel
donde acertó a hallarse don Quijote era muy a propósito de los gallegos.
Sucedió, pues, que a Rocinante le vino en deseo de refocilarse con las
señoras facas; y saliendo, así como las olió, de su natural paso y
costumbre, sin pedir licencia a su dueño, tomó un trotico algo picadillo
y se fue a comunicar su necesidad con ellas. Mas ellas, que, a lo que
pareció, debían de tener más gana de pacer que de ál, recibiéronle con las
herraduras y con los dientes, de tal manera que, a poco espacio, se le
rompieron las cinchas y quedó, sin silla, en pelota. Pero lo que él debió
más de sentir fue que, viendo los arrieros la fuerza que a sus yeguas se
les hacía, acudieron con estacas, y tantos palos le dieron que le
derribaron malparado en el suelo.
Ya en esto don Quijote y Sancho, que la paliza de Rocinante habían visto,
llegaban ijadeando; y dijo don Quijote a Sancho:
— A lo que yo veo, amigo Sancho, éstos no son caballeros, sino gente soez y
de baja ralea. Dígolo porque bien me puedes ayudar a tomar la debida
venganza del agravio que delante de nuestros ojos se le ha hecho a
Rocinante.
— ¿Qué diablos de venganza hemos de tomar —respondió Sancho—, si éstos son
más de veinte y nosotros no más de dos, y aun, quizá, nosotros sino uno y
medio?
— Yo valgo por ciento —replicó don Quijote.
Y, sin hacer más discursos, echó mano a su espada y arremetió a los
gallegos, y lo mesmo hizo Sancho Panza, incitado y movido del ejemplo de su
amo. Y, a las primeras, dio don Quijote una cuchillada a uno, que le abrió
un sayo de cuero de que venía vestido, con gran parte de la espalda.
Los gallegos, que se vieron maltratar de aquellos dos hombres solos, siendo
ellos tantos, acudieron a sus estacas, y, cogiendo a los dos en medio,
comenzaron a menudear sobre ellos con grande ahínco y vehemencia. Verdad es
que al segundo toque dieron con Sancho en el suelo, y lo mesmo le avino a
don Quijote, sin que le valiese su destreza y buen ánimo; y quiso su
ventura que viniese a caer a los pies de Rocinante, que aún no se había
levantado; donde se echa de ver la furia con que machacan estacas puestas
en manos rústicas y enojadas.
Viendo, pues, los gallegos el mal recado que habían hecho, con la mayor
presteza que pudieron, cargaron su recua y siguieron su camino, dejando a
los dos aventureros de mala traza y de peor talante.
El primero que se resintió fue Sancho Panza; y, hallándose junto a su
señor, con voz enferma y lastimada, dijo:
— ¡Señor don Quijote! ¡Ah, señor don Quijote!
— ¿Qué quieres, Sancho hermano? —respondió don Quijote con el mesmo tono
afeminado y doliente que Sancho.
— Querría, si fuese posible —respondió Sancho Panza—, que vuestra merced me
diese dos tragos de aquella bebida del feo Blas, si es que la tiene vuestra
merced ahí a mano. Quizá será de provecho para los quebrantamientos de
huesos como lo es para las feridas.
— Pues, a tenerla yo aquí, desgraciado yo, ¿qué nos faltaba? —respondió don
Quijote—. Mas yo te juro, Sancho Panza, a fe de caballero andante, que
antes que pasen dos días, si la fortuna no ordena otra cosa, la tengo de
tener en mi poder, o mal me han de andar las manos.
— Pues, ¿en cuántos le parece a vuestra merced que podremos mover los pies?
— replicó Sancho Panza.
— De mí sé decir —dijo el molido caballero don Quijote— que no sabré poner
término a esos días. Mas yo me tengo la culpa de todo, que no había de
poner mano a la espada contra hombres que no fuesen armados caballeros como
yo; y así, creo que, en pena de haber pasado las leyes de la caballería, ha
permitido el dios de las batallas que se me diese este castigo. Por lo
cual, Sancho Panza, conviene que estés advertido en esto que ahora te diré,
porque importa mucho a la salud de entrambos; y es que, cuando veas que
semejante canalla nos hace algún agravio, no aguardes a que yo ponga mano
al espada para ellos, porque no lo haré en ninguna manera, sino pon tú mano
a tu espada y castígalos muy a tu sabor; que si en su ayuda y defensa
acudieren caballeros, yo te sabré defender y ofendellos con todo mi poder;
que ya habrás visto por mil señales y experiencias hasta adónde se estiende
el valor de este mi fuerte brazo.
Tal quedó de arrogante el pobre señor con el vencimiento del valiente
vizcaíno. Mas no le pareció tan bien a Sancho Panza el aviso de su amo que
dejase de responder, diciendo:
— Señor, yo soy hombre pacífico, manso, sosegado, y sé disimilar cualquiera
injuria, porque tengo mujer y hijos que sustentar y criar. Así que, séale a
vuestra merced también aviso, pues no puede ser mandato, que en ninguna
manera pondré mano a la espada, ni contra villano ni contra caballero; y
que, desde aquí para delante de Dios, perdono cuantos agravios me han hecho
y han de hacer: ora me los haya hecho, o haga o haya de hacer, persona alta
o baja, rico o pobre, hidalgo o pechero, sin eceptar estado ni condición
alguna.
Lo cual oído por su amo, le respondió:
— Quisiera tener aliento para poder hablar un poco descansado, y que el
dolor que tengo en esta costilla se aplacara tanto cuanto, para darte a
entender, Panza, en el error en que estás. Ven acá, pecador; si el viento
de la fortuna, hasta ahora tan contrario, en nuestro favor se vuelve,
llevándonos las velas del deseo para que seguramente y sin contraste alguno
tomemos puerto en alguna de las ínsulas que te tengo prometida, ¿qué sería
de ti si, ganándola yo, te hiciese señor della? Pues ¿lo vendrás a
imposibilitar por no ser caballero, ni quererlo ser, ni tener valor ni
intención de vengar tus injurias y defender tu señorío? Porque has de saber
que en los reinos y provincias nuevamente conquistados nunca están tan
quietos los ánimos de sus naturales, ni tan de parte del nuevo señor que no
se tengan temor de que han de hacer alguna novedad para alterar de nuevo
las cosas, y volver, como dicen, a probar ventura; y así, es menester que
el nuevo posesor tenga entendimiento para saberse gobernar, y valor para
ofender y defenderse en cualquiera acontecimiento.
— En este que ahora nos ha acontecido —respondió Sancho—, quisiera yo tener
ese entendimiento y ese valor que vuestra merced dice; mas yo le juro, a fe
de pobre hombre, que más estoy para bizmas que para pláticas. Mire vuestra
merced si se puede levantar, y ayudaremos a Rocinante, aunque no lo merece,
porque él fue la causa principal de todo este molimiento. Jamás tal creí de
Rocinante, que le tenía por persona casta y tan pacífica como yo. En fin,
bien dicen que es menester mucho tiempo para venir a conocer las personas,
y que no hay cosa segura en esta vida. ¿Quién dijera que tras de aquellas
tan grandes cuchilladas como vuestra merced dio a aquel desdichado
caballero andante, había de venir, por la posta y en seguimiento suyo, esta
tan grande tempestad de palos que ha descargado sobre nuestras espaldas?
— Aun las tuyas, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—, deben de estar hechas a
semejantes nublados; pero las mías, criadas entre sinabafas y holandas,
claro está que sentirán más el dolor desta desgracia. Y si no fuese porque
imagino..., ¿qué digo imagino?, sé muy cierto, que todas estas
incomodidades son muy anejas al ejercicio de las armas, aquí me dejaría
morir de puro enojo.
A esto replicó el escudero:
— Señor, ya que estas desgracias son de la cosecha de la caballería, dígame
vuestra merced si suceden muy a menudo, o si tienen sus tiempos limitados
en que acaecen; porque me parece a mí que a dos cosechas quedaremos
inútiles para la tercera, si Dios, por su infinita misericordia, no nos
socorre.
— Sábete, amigo Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que la vida de los
caballeros andantes está sujeta a mil peligros y desventuras; y, ni más ni
menos, está en potencia propincua de ser los caballeros andantes reyes y
emperadores, como lo ha mostrado la experiencia en muchos y diversos
caballeros, de cuyas historias yo tengo entera noticia. Y pudiérate contar
agora, si el dolor me diera lugar, de algunos que, sólo por el valor de su
brazo, han subido a los altos grados que he contado; y estos mesmos se
vieron antes y después en diversas calamidades y miserias. Porque el
valeroso Amadís de Gaula se vio en poder de su mortal enemigo Arcaláus el
encantador, de quien se tiene por averiguado que le dio, teniéndole
preso, más de docientos azotes con las riendas de su caballo, atado a una
coluna de un patio. Y aun hay un autor secreto, y de no poco crédito, que
dice que, habiendo cogido al Caballero del Febo con una cierta trampa que
se le hundió debajo de los pies, en un cierto castillo, y al caer, se halló
en una honda sima debajo de tierra, atado de pies y manos, y allí le
echaron una destas que llaman melecinas, de agua de nieve y arena, de lo
que llegó muy al cabo; y si no fuera socorrido en aquella gran cuita de un
sabio grande amigo suyo, lo pasara muy mal el pobre caballero. Ansí que,
bien puedo yo pasar entre tanta buena gente; que mayores afrentas son las
que éstos pasaron, que no las que ahora nosotros pasamos. Porque quiero
hacerte sabidor, Sancho, que no afrentan las heridas que se dan con los
instrumentos que acaso se hallan en las manos; y esto está en la ley del
duelo, escrito por palabras expresas: que si el zapatero da a otro con la
horma que tiene en la mano, puesto que verdaderamente es de palo, no por
eso se dirá que queda apaleado aquel a quien dio con ella. Digo esto porque
no pienses que, puesto que quedamos desta pendencia molidos, quedamos
afrentados; porque las armas que aquellos hombres traían, con que nos
machacaron, no eran otras que sus estacas, y ninguno dellos, a lo que se me
acuerda, tenía estoque, espada ni puñal.
— No me dieron a mí lugar —respondió Sancho— a que mirase en tanto; porque,
apenas puse mano a mi tizona, cuando me santiguaron los hombros con sus
pinos, de manera que me quitaron la vista de los ojos y la fuerza de los
pies, dando conmigo adonde ahora yago, y adonde no me da pena alguna el
pensar si fue afrenta o no lo de los estacazos, como me la da el dolor de
los golpes, que me han de quedar tan impresos en la memoria como en las
espaldas.
— Con todo eso, te hago saber, hermano Panza —replicó don Quijote—, que no
hay memoria a quien el tiempo no acabe, ni dolor que muerte no le consuma.
— Pues, ¿qué mayor desdicha puede ser —replicó Panza— de aquella que aguarda
al tiempo que la consuma y a la muerte que la acabe? Si esta nuestra
desgracia fuera de aquellas que con un par de bizmas se curan, aun no tan
malo; pero voy viendo que no han de bastar todos los emplastos de un
hospital para ponerlas en buen término siquiera.
— Déjate deso y saca fuerzas de flaqueza, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—,
que así haré yo, y veamos cómo está Rocinante; que, a lo que me parece, no
le ha cabido al pobre la menor parte desta desgracia.
— No hay de qué maravillarse deso —respondió Sancho—, siendo él tan buen
caballero andante; de lo que yo me maravillo es de que mi jumento haya
quedado libre y sin costas donde nosotros salimos sin costillas.
— Siempre deja la ventura una puerta abierta en las desdichas, para dar
remedio a ellas —dijo don Quijote—. Dígolo porque esa bestezuela podrá
suplir ahora la falta de Rocinante, llevándome a mí desde aquí a algún
castillo donde sea curado de mis feridas. Y más, que no tendré a deshonra
la tal caballería, porque me acuerdo haber leído que aquel buen viejo
Sileno, ayo y pedagogo del alegre dios de la risa, cuando entró en la
ciudad de las cien puertas iba, muy a su placer, caballero sobre un muy
hermoso asno.
— Verdad será que él debía de ir caballero, como vuestra merced dice
— respondió Sancho—, pero hay grande diferencia del ir caballero al ir
atravesado como costal de basura.
A lo cual respondió don Quijote:
— Las feridas que se reciben en las batallas, antes dan honra que la quitan.
Así que, Panza amigo, no me repliques más, sino, como ya te he dicho,
levántate lo mejor que pudieres y ponme de la manera que más te agradare
encima de tu jumento, y vamos de aquí antes que la noche venga y nos saltee
en este despoblado.
— Pues yo he oído decir a vuestra merced —dijo Panza— que es muy de
caballeros andantes el dormir en los páramos y desiertos lo más del año, y
que lo tienen a mucha ventura.
— Eso es —dijo don Quijote— cuando no pueden más, o cuando están enamorados;
y es tan verdad esto, que ha habido caballero que se ha estado sobre una
peña, al sol y a la sombra, y a las inclemencias del cielo, dos años, sin
que lo supiese su señora. Y uno déstos fue Amadís, cuando, llamándose
Beltenebros, se alojó en la Peña Pobre, ni sé si ocho años o ocho meses,
que no estoy muy bien en la cuenta: basta que él estuvo allí haciendo
penitencia, por no sé qué sinsabor que le hizo la señora Oriana. Pero
dejemos ya esto, Sancho, y acaba, antes que suceda otra desgracia al
jumento, como a Rocinante.
— Aun ahí sería el diablo —dijo Sancho.
Y, despidiendo treinta ayes, y sesenta sospiros, y ciento y veinte pésetes
y reniegos de quien allí le había traído, se levantó, quedándose agobiado
en la mitad del camino, como arco turquesco, sin poder acabar de
enderezarse; y con todo este trabajo aparejó su asno, que también había
andado algo destraído con la demasiada libertad de aquel día. Levantó luego
a Rocinante, el cual, si tuviera lengua con que quejarse, a buen seguro que
Sancho ni su amo no le fueran en zaga.
En resolución, Sancho acomodó a don Quijote sobre el asno y puso de reata a
Rocinante; y, llevando al asno de cabestro, se encaminó, poco más a menos,
hacia donde le pareció que podía estar el camino real. Y la suerte, que sus
cosas de bien en mejor iba guiando, aún no hubo andado una pequeña legua,
cuando le deparó el camino, en el cual descubrió una venta que, a pesar
suyo y gusto de don Quijote, había de ser castillo. Porfiaba Sancho que era
venta, y su amo que no, sino castillo; y tanto duró la porfía, que tuvieron
lugar, sin acabarla, de llegar a ella, en la cual Sancho se entró, sin más
averiguación, con toda su recua.
Capítulo XVI. De lo que le sucedió al ingenioso hidalgo en la venta que él
imaginaba ser castillo
El ventero, que vio a don Quijote atravesado en el asno, preguntó a Sancho
qué mal traía. Sancho le respondió que no era nada, sino que había dado una
caída de una peña abajo, y que venía algo brumadas las costillas. Tenía el
ventero por mujer a una, no de la condición que suelen tener las de
semejante trato, porque naturalmente era caritativa y se dolía de las
calamidades de sus prójimos; y así, acudió luego a curar a don Quijote y
hizo que una hija suya, doncella, muchacha y de muy buen parecer, la
ayudase a curar a su huésped. Servía en la venta, asimesmo, una moza
asturiana, ancha de cara, llana de cogote, de nariz roma, del un ojo tuerta
y del otro no muy sana. Verdad es que la gallardía del cuerpo suplía las
demás faltas: no tenía siete palmos de los pies a la cabeza, y las
espaldas, que algún tanto le cargaban, la hacían mirar al suelo más de lo
que ella quisiera. Esta gentil moza, pues, ayudó a la doncella, y las dos
hicieron una muy mala cama a don Quijote en un camaranchón que, en otros
tiempos, daba manifiestos indicios que había servido de pajar muchos años.
En la cual también alojaba un arriero, que tenía su cama hecha un poco más
allá de la de nuestro don Quijote. Y, aunque era de las enjalmas y mantas
de sus machos, hacía mucha ventaja a la de don Quijote, que sólo contenía
cuatro mal lisas tablas, sobre dos no muy iguales bancos, y un colchón que
en lo sutil parecía colcha, lleno de bodoques, que, a no mostrar que eran
de lana por algunas roturas, al tiento, en la dureza, semejaban de
guijarro, y dos sábanas hechas de cuero de adarga, y una frazada, cuyos
hilos, si se quisieran contar, no se perdiera uno solo de la cuenta.
En esta maldita cama se acostó don Quijote, y luego la ventera y su hija le
emplastaron de arriba abajo, alumbrándoles Maritornes, que así se llamaba
la asturiana; y, como al bizmalle viese la ventera tan acardenalado a
partes a don Quijote, dijo que aquello más parecían golpes que caída.
— No fueron golpes —dijo Sancho—, sino que la peña tenía muchos picos y
tropezones.
Y que cada uno había hecho su cardenal. Y también le dijo:
— Haga vuestra merced, señora, de manera que queden algunas estopas, que no
faltará quien las haya menester; que también me duelen a mí un poco los
lomos.
— Desa manera —respondió la ventera—, también debistes vos de caer.
— No caí —dijo Sancho Panza—, sino que del sobresalto que tomé de ver caer a
mi amo, de tal manera me duele a mí el cuerpo que me parece que me han dado
mil palos.
— Bien podrá ser eso —dijo la doncella—; que a mí me ha acontecido muchas
veces soñar que caía de una torre abajo y que nunca acababa de llegar al
suelo, y, cuando despertaba del sueño, hallarme tan molida y quebrantada
como si verdaderamente hubiera caído.
— Ahí está el toque, señora —respondió Sancho Panza—: que yo, sin soñar
nada, sino estando más despierto que ahora estoy, me hallo con pocos menos
cardenales que mi señor don Quijote.
— ¿Cómo se llama este caballero? —preguntó la asturiana Maritornes.
— Don Quijote de la Mancha —respondió Sancho Panza—, y es caballero
aventurero, y de los mejores y más fuertes que de luengos tiempos acá se
han visto en el mundo.
— ¿Qué es caballero aventurero? —replicó la moza.
— ¿Tan nueva sois en el mundo que no lo sabéis vos? —respondió Sancho
Panza—. Pues sabed, hermana mía, que caballero aventurero es una cosa que
en dos palabras se ve apaleado y emperador. Hoy está la más desdichada
criatura del mundo y la más menesterosa, y mañana tendría dos o tres
coronas de reinos que dar a su escudero.
— Pues, ¿cómo vos, siéndolo deste tan buen señor —dijo la ventera—, no
tenéis, a lo que parece, siquiera algún condado?
— Aún es temprano —respondió Sancho—, porque no ha sino un mes que andamos
buscando las aventuras, y hasta ahora no hemos topado con ninguna que lo
sea. Y tal vez hay que se busca una cosa y se halla otra. Verdad es que, si
mi señor don Quijote sana desta herida o caída y yo no quedo contrecho
della, no trocaría mis esperanzas con el mejor título de España.
Todas estas pláticas estaba escuchando, muy atento, don Quijote, y,
sentándose en el lecho como pudo, tomando de la mano a la ventera, le dijo:
— Creedme, fermosa señora, que os podéis llamar venturosa por haber alojado
en este vuestro castillo a mi persona, que es tal, que si yo no la alabo,
es por lo que suele decirse que la alabanza propria envilece; pero mi
escudero os dirá quién soy. Sólo os digo que tendré eternamente escrito en
mi memoria el servicio que me habedes fecho, para agradecéroslo mientras la
vida me durare; y pluguiera a los altos cielos que el amor no me tuviera
tan rendido y tan sujeto a sus leyes, y los ojos de aquella hermosa ingrata
que digo entre mis dientes; que los desta fermosa doncella fueran señores
de mi libertad.
Confusas estaban la ventera y su hija y la buena de Maritornes oyendo las
razones del andante caballero, que así las entendían como si hablara en
griego, aunque bien alcanzaron que todas se encaminaban a ofrecimiento y
requiebros; y, como no usadas a semejante lenguaje, mirábanle y
admirábanse, y parecíales otro hombre de los que se usaban; y,
agradeciéndole con venteriles razones sus ofrecimientos, le dejaron; y la
asturiana Maritornes curó a Sancho, que no menos lo había menester que su
amo.
Había el arriero concertado con ella que aquella noche se refocilarían
juntos, y ella le había dado su palabra de que, en estando sosegados los
huéspedes y durmiendo sus amos, le iría a buscar y satisfacerle el gusto en
cuanto le mandase. Y cuéntase desta buena moza que jamás dio semejantes
palabras que no las cumpliese, aunque las diese en un monte y sin testigo
alguno; porque presumía muy de hidalga, y no tenía por afrenta estar en
aquel ejercicio de servir en la venta, porque decía ella que desgracias y
malos sucesos la habían traído a aquel estado.
El duro, estrecho, apocado y fementido lecho de don Quijote estaba primero
en mitad de aquel estrellado establo, y luego, junto a él, hizo el suyo
Sancho, que sólo contenía una estera de enea y una manta, que antes
mostraba ser de anjeo tundido que de lana. Sucedía a estos dos lechos el
del arriero, fabricado, como se ha dicho, de las enjalmas y todo el adorno
de los dos mejores mulos que traía, aunque eran doce, lucios, gordos y
famosos, porque era uno de los ricos arrieros de Arévalo, según lo dice el
autor desta historia, que deste arriero hace particular mención, porque le
conocía muy bien, y aun quieren decir que era algo pariente suyo. Fuera de
que Cide Mahamate Benengeli fue historiador muy curioso y muy puntual en
todas las cosas; y échase bien de ver, pues las que quedan referidas, con
ser tan mínimas y tan rateras, no las quiso pasar en silencio; de donde
podrán tomar ejemplo los historiadores graves, que nos cuentan las acciones
tan corta y sucintamente que apenas nos llegan a los labios, dejándose en
el tintero, ya por descuido, por malicia o ignorancia, lo más sustancial de
la obra. ¡Bien haya mil veces el autor de Tablante de Ricamonte, y aquel
del otro libro donde se cuenta los hechos del conde Tomillas; y con qué
puntualidad lo describen todo!
Digo, pues, que después de haber visitado el arriero a su recua y dádole el
segundo pienso, se tendió en sus enjalmas y se dio a esperar a su
puntualísima Maritornes. Ya estaba Sancho bizmado y acostado, y, aunque
procuraba dormir, no lo consentía el dolor de sus costillas; y don Quijote,
con el dolor de las suyas, tenía los ojos abiertos como liebre. Toda la
venta estaba en silencio, y en toda ella no había otra luz que la que daba
una lámpara que colgada en medio del portal ardía.
Esta maravillosa quietud, y los pensamientos que siempre nuestro caballero
traía de los sucesos que a cada paso se cuentan en los libros autores de su
desgracia, le trujo a la imaginación una de las estrañas locuras que
buenamente imaginarse pueden. Y fue que él se imaginó haber llegado a un
famoso castillo —que, como se ha dicho, castillos eran a su parecer todas
las ventas donde alojaba—, y que la hija del ventero lo era del señor del
castillo, la cual, vencida de su gentileza, se había enamorado dél y
prometido que aquella noche, a furto de sus padres, vendría a yacer con él
una buena pieza; y, teniendo toda esta quimera, que él se había fabricado,
por firme y valedera, se comenzó a acuitar y a pensar en el peligroso
trance en que su honestidad se había de ver, y propuso en su corazón de no
cometer alevosía a su señora Dulcinea del Toboso, aunque la mesma reina
Ginebra con su dama Quintañona se le pusiesen delante.
Pensando, pues, en estos disparates, se llegó el tiempo y la hora —que para
él fue menguada— de la venida de la asturiana, la cual, en camisa y
descalza, cogidos los cabellos en una albanega de fustán, con tácitos y
atentados pasos, entró en el aposento donde los tres alojaban en busca del
arriero. Pero, apenas llegó a la puerta, cuando don Quijote la sintió, y,
sentándose en la cama, a pesar de sus bizmas y con dolor de sus costillas,
tendió los brazos para recebir a su fermosa doncella. La asturiana, que,
toda recogida y callando, iba con las manos delante buscando a su querido,
topó con los brazos de don Quijote, el cual la asió fuertemente de una
muñeca y, tirándola hacía sí, sin que ella osase hablar palabra, la hizo
sentar sobre la cama. Tentóle luego la camisa, y, aunque ella era de
harpillera, a él le pareció ser de finísimo y delgado cendal. Traía en las
muñecas unas cuentas de vidro, pero a él le dieron vislumbres de preciosas
perlas orientales. Los cabellos, que en alguna manera tiraban a crines, él
los marcó por hebras de lucidísimo oro de Arabia, cuyo resplandor al del
mesmo sol escurecía. Y el aliento, que, sin duda alguna, olía a ensalada
fiambre y trasnochada, a él le pareció que arrojaba de su boca un olor
suave y aromático; y, finalmente, él la pintó en su imaginación de la misma
traza y modo que lo había leído en sus libros de la otra princesa que vino
a ver el mal ferido caballero, vencida de sus amores, con todos los adornos
que aquí van puestos. Y era tanta la ceguedad del pobre hidalgo, que el
tacto, ni el aliento, ni otras cosas que traía en sí la buena doncella, no
le desengañaban, las cuales pudieran hacer vomitar a otro que no fuera
arriero; antes, le parecía que tenía entre sus brazos a la diosa de la
hermosura. Y, teniéndola bien asida, con voz amorosa y baja le comenzó a
decir:
— Quisiera hallarme en términos, fermosa y alta señora, de poder pagar
tamaña merced como la que con la vista de vuestra gran fermosura me habedes
fecho, pero ha querido la fortuna, que no se cansa de perseguir a los
buenos, ponerme en este lecho, donde yago tan molido y quebrantado que,
aunque de mi voluntad quisiera satisfacer a la vuestra, fuera imposible. Y
más, que se añade a esta imposibilidad otra mayor, que es la prometida fe
que tengo dada a la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso, única señora de mis más
escondidos pensamientos; que si esto no hubiera de por medio, no fuera yo
tan sandio caballero que dejara pasar en blanco la venturosa ocasión en que
vuestra gran bondad me ha puesto.
Maritornes estaba congojadísima y trasudando, de verse tan asida de don
Quijote, y, sin entender ni estar atenta a las razones que le decía,
procuraba, sin hablar palabra, desasirse. El bueno del arriero, a quien
tenían despierto sus malos deseos, desde el punto que entró su coima por la
puerta, la sintió; estuvo atentamente escuchando todo lo que don Quijote
decía, y, celoso de que la asturiana le hubiese faltado la palabra por
otro, se fue llegando más al lecho de don Quijote, y estúvose quedo hasta
ver en qué paraban aquellas razones, que él no podía entender. Pero, como
vio que la moza forcejaba por desasirse y don Quijote trabajaba por
tenella, pareciéndole mal la burla, enarboló el brazo en alto y descargó
tan terrible puñada sobre las estrechas quijadas del enamorado caballero,
que le bañó toda la boca en sangre; y, no contento con esto, se le subió
encima de las costillas, y con los pies más que de trote, se las paseó
todas de cabo a cabo.
El lecho, que era un poco endeble y de no firmes fundamentos, no pudiendo
sufrir la añadidura del arriero, dio consigo en el suelo, a cuyo gran ruido
despertó el ventero, y luego imaginó que debían de ser pendencias de
Maritornes, porque, habiéndola llamado a voces, no respondía. Con esta
sospecha se levantó, y, encendiendo un candil, se fue hacia donde había
sentido la pelaza. La moza, viendo que su amo venía, y que era de condición
terrible, toda medrosica y alborotada, se acogió a la cama de Sancho Panza,
que aún dormía, y allí se acorrucó y se hizo un ovillo. El ventero entró
diciendo:
— ¿Adónde estás, puta? A buen seguro que son tus cosas éstas.
En esto, despertó Sancho, y, sintiendo aquel bulto casi encima de sí, pensó
que tenía la pesadilla, y comenzó a dar puñadas a una y otra parte, y entre
otras alcanzó con no sé cuántas a Maritornes, la cual, sentida del dolor,
echando a rodar la honestidad, dio el retorno a Sancho con tantas que, a su
despecho, le quitó el sueño; el cual, viéndose tratar de aquella manera y
sin saber de quién, alzándose como pudo, se abrazó con Maritornes, y
comenzaron entre los dos la más reñida y graciosa escaramuza del mundo.
Viendo, pues, el arriero, a la lumbre del candil del ventero, cuál andaba
su dama, dejando a don Quijote, acudió a dalle el socorro necesario. Lo
mismo hizo el ventero, pero con intención diferente, porque fue a castigar
a la moza, creyendo sin duda que ella sola era la ocasión de toda aquella
armonía. Y así como suele decirse: el gato al rato, el rato a la cuerda, la
cuerda al palo, daba el arriero a Sancho, Sancho a la moza, la moza a él,
el ventero a la moza, y todos menudeaban con tanta priesa que no se daban
punto de reposo; y fue lo bueno que al ventero se le apagó el candil, y,
como quedaron ascuras, dábanse tan sin compasión todos a bulto que, a
doquiera que ponían la mano, no dejaban cosa sana.
Alojaba acaso aquella noche en la venta un cuadrillero de los que llaman de
la Santa Hermandad Vieja de Toledo, el cual, oyendo ansimesmo el estraño
estruendo de la pelea, asió de su media vara y de la caja de lata de sus
títulos, y entró ascuras en el aposento, diciendo:
— ¡Ténganse a la justicia! ¡Ténganse a la Santa Hermandad!
Y el primero con quien topó fue con el apuñeado de don Quijote, que estaba
en su derribado lecho, tendido boca arriba, sin sentido alguno, y,
echándole a tiento mano a las barbas, no cesaba de decir:
— ¡Favor a la justicia!
Pero, viendo que el que tenía asido no se bullía ni meneaba, se dio a
entender que estaba muerto, y que los que allí dentro estaban eran sus
matadores; y con esta sospecha reforzó la voz, diciendo:
— ¡Ciérrese la puerta de la venta! ¡Miren no se vaya nadie, que han muerto
aquí a un hombre!
Esta voz sobresaltó a todos, y cada cual dejó la pendencia en el grado que
le tomó la voz. Retiróse el ventero a su aposento, el arriero a sus
enjalmas, la moza a su rancho; solos los desventurados don Quijote y Sancho
no se pudieron mover de donde estaban. Soltó en esto el cuadrillero la
barba de don Quijote, y salió a buscar luz para buscar y prender los
delincuentes; mas no la halló, porque el ventero, de industria, había
muerto la lámpara cuando se retiró a su estancia, y fuele forzoso acudir a
la chimenea, donde, con mucho trabajo y tiempo, encendió el cuadrillero
otro candil.
Capítulo XVII. Donde se prosiguen los innumerables trabajos que el bravo
don Quijote y su buen escudero Sancho Panza pasaron en la venta que, por su
mal, pensó que era castillo
Había ya vuelto en este tiempo de su parasismo don Quijote, y, con el mesmo
tono de voz con que el día antes había llamado a su escudero, cuando estaba
tendido en el val de las estacas, le comenzó a llamar, diciendo:
— Sancho amigo, ¿duermes? ¿Duermes, amigo Sancho?
— ¿Qué tengo de dormir, pesia a mí —respondió Sancho, lleno de pesadumbre y
de despecho—; que no parece sino que todos los diablos han andado conmigo
esta noche?
— Puédeslo creer ansí, sin duda —respondió don Quijote—, porque, o yo sé
poco, o este castillo es encantado. Porque has de saber... Mas, esto que
ahora quiero decirte hasme de jurar que lo tendrás secreto hasta después de
mi muerte.
— Sí juro —respondió Sancho.
— Dígolo —replicó don Quijote—, porque soy enemigo de que se quite la honra
a nadie.
— Digo que sí juro —tornó a decir Sancho— que lo callaré hasta después de
los días de vuestra merced, y plega a Dios que lo pueda descubrir mañana.
— ¿Tan malas obras te hago, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que me querrías
ver muerto con tanta brevedad?
— No es por eso —respondió Sancho—, sino porque soy enemigo de guardar mucho
las cosas, y no querría que se me pudriesen de guardadas.
— Sea por lo que fuere —dijo don Quijote—; que más fío de tu amor y de tu
cortesía; y así, has de saber que esta noche me ha sucedido una de las más
estrañas aventuras que yo sabré encarecer; y, por contártela en breve,
sabrás que poco ha que a mí vino la hija del señor deste castillo, que es
la más apuesta y fermosa doncella que en gran parte de la tierra se puede
hallar. ¿Qué te podría decir del adorno de su persona? ¿Qué de su gallardo
entendimiento? ¿Qué de otras cosas ocultas, que, por guardar la fe que debo
a mi señora Dulcinea del Toboso, dejaré pasar intactas y en silencio? Sólo
te quiero decir que, envidioso el cielo de tanto bien como la ventura me
había puesto en las manos, o quizá, y esto es lo más cierto, que, como
tengo dicho, es encantado este castillo, al tiempo que yo estaba con ella
en dulcísimos y amorosísimos coloquios, sin que yo la viese ni supiese por
dónde venía, vino una mano pegada a algún brazo de algún descomunal gigante
y asentóme una puñada en las quijadas, tal, que las tengo todas bañadas en
sangre; y después me molió de tal suerte que estoy peor que ayer cuando los
gallegos, que, por demasías de Rocinante, nos hicieron el agravio que
sabes. Por donde conjeturo que el tesoro de la fermosura desta doncella le
debe de guardar algún encantado moro, y no debe de ser para mí.
— Ni para mí tampoco —respondió Sancho—, porque más de cuatrocientos moros
me han aporreado a mí, de manera que el molimiento de las estacas fue
tortas y pan pintado. Pero dígame, señor, ¿cómo llama a ésta buena y rara
aventura, habiendo quedado della cual quedamos? Aun vuestra merced menos
mal, pues tuvo en sus manos aquella incomparable fermosura que ha dicho,
pero yo, ¿qué tuve sino los mayores porrazos que pienso recebir en toda mi
vida? ¡Desdichado de mí y de la madre que me parió, que ni soy caballero
andante, ni lo pienso ser jamás, y de todas las malandanzas me cabe la
mayor parte!
— Luego, ¿también estás tú aporreado? —respondió don Quijote.
— ¿No le he dicho que sí, pesia a mi linaje? —dijo Sancho.
— No tengas pena, amigo —dijo don Quijote—, que yo haré agora el bálsamo
precioso con que sanaremos en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.
Acabó en esto de encender el candil el cuadrillero, y entró a ver el que
pensaba que era muerto; y, así como le vio entrar Sancho, viéndole venir en
camisa y con su paño de cabeza y candil en la mano, y con una muy mala
cara, preguntó a su amo:
— Señor, ¿si será éste, a dicha, el moro encantado, que nos vuelve a
castigar, si se dejó algo en el tintero?
— No puede ser el moro —respondió don Quijote—, porque los encantados no se
dejan ver de nadie.
— Si no se dejan ver, déjanse sentir —dijo Sancho—; si no, díganlo mis
espaldas.
— También lo podrían decir las mías —respondió don Quijote—, pero no es
bastante indicio ése para creer que este que se vee sea el encantado moro.
Llegó el cuadrillero, y, como los halló hablando en tan sosegada
conversación, quedó suspenso. Bien es verdad que aún don Quijote se estaba
boca arriba, sin poderse menear, de puro molido y emplastado. Llegóse a él
el cuadrillero y díjole:
— Pues, ¿cómo va, buen hombre?
— Hablara yo más bien criado —respondió don Quijote—, si fuera que vos.
¿Úsase en esta tierra hablar desa suerte a los caballeros andantes,
majadero?
El cuadrillero, que se vio tratar tan mal de un hombre de tan mal parecer,
no lo pudo sufrir, y, alzando el candil con todo su aceite, dio a don
Quijote con él en la cabeza, de suerte que le dejó muy bien descalabrado;
y, como todo quedó ascuras, salióse luego; y Sancho Panza dijo:
— Sin duda, señor, que éste es el moro encantado, y debe de guardar el
tesoro para otros, y para nosotros sólo guarda las puñadas y los
candilazos.
— Así es —respondió don Quijote—, y no hay que hacer caso destas cosas de
encantamentos, ni hay para qué tomar cólera ni enojo con ellas; que, como
son invisibles y fantásticas, no hallaremos de quién vengarnos, aunque más
lo procuremos. Levántate, Sancho, si puedes, y llama al alcaide desta
fortaleza, y procura que se me dé un poco de aceite, vino, sal y romero
para hacer el salutífero bálsamo; que en verdad que creo que lo he bien
menester ahora, porque se me va mucha sangre de la herida que esta fantasma
me ha dado.
Levántose Sancho con harto dolor de sus huesos, y fue ascuras donde estaba
el ventero; y, encontrándose con el cuadrillero, que estaba escuchando en
qué paraba su enemigo, le dijo:
— Señor, quien quiera que seáis, hacednos merced y beneficio de darnos un
poco de romero, aceite, sal y vino, que es menester para curar uno de los
mejores caballeros andantes que hay en la tierra, el cual yace en aquella
cama, malferido por las manos del encantado moro que está en esta venta.
Cuando el cuadrillero tal oyó, túvole por hombre falto de seso; y, porque
ya comenzaba a amanecer, abrió la puerta de la venta, y, llamando al
ventero, le dijo lo que aquel buen hombre quería. El ventero le proveyó de
cuanto quiso, y Sancho se lo llevó a don Quijote, que estaba con las manos
en la cabeza, quejándose del dolor del candilazo, que no le había hecho más
mal que levantarle dos chichones algo crecidos, y lo que él pensaba que era
sangre no era sino sudor que sudaba con la congoja de la pasada tormenta.
En resolución, él tomó sus simples, de los cuales hizo un compuesto,
mezclándolos todos y cociéndolos un buen espacio, hasta que le pareció que
estaban en su punto. Pidió luego alguna redoma para echallo, y, como no la
hubo en la venta, se resolvió de ponello en una alcuza o aceitera de hoja
de lata, de quien el ventero le hizo grata donación. Y luego dijo sobre la
alcuza más de ochenta paternostres y otras tantas avemarías, salves y
credos, y a cada palabra acompañaba una cruz, a modo de bendición; a todo
lo cual se hallaron presentes Sancho, el ventero y cuadrillero; que ya el
arriero sosegadamente andaba entendiendo en el beneficio de sus machos.
Hecho esto, quiso él mesmo hacer luego la esperiencia de la virtud de aquel
precioso bálsamo que él se imaginaba; y así, se bebió, de lo que no pudo
caber en la alcuza y quedaba en la olla donde se había cocido, casi media
azumbre; y apenas lo acabó de beber, cuando comenzó a vomitar de manera que
no le quedó cosa en el estómago; y con las ansias y agitación del vómito le
dio un sudor copiosísimo, por lo cual mandó que le arropasen y le dejasen
solo. Hiciéronlo ansí, y quedóse dormido más de tres horas, al cabo de las
cuales despertó y se sintió aliviadísimo del cuerpo, y en tal manera mejor
de su quebrantamiento que se tuvo por sano; y verdaderamente creyó que
había acertado con el bálsamo de Fierabrás, y que con aquel remedio podía
acometer desde allí adelante, sin temor alguno, cualesquiera ruinas,
batallas y pendencias, por peligrosas que fuesen.
Sancho Panza, que también tuvo a milagro la mejoría de su amo, le rogó que
le diese a él lo que quedaba en la olla, que no era poca cantidad.
Concedióselo don Quijote, y él, tomándola a dos manos, con buena fe y mejor
talante, se la echó a pechos, y envasó bien poco menos que su amo. Es,
pues, el caso que el estómago del pobre Sancho no debía de ser tan delicado
como el de su amo, y así, primero que vomitase, le dieron tantas ansias y
bascas, con tantos trasudores y desmayos que él pensó bien y verdaderamente
que era llegada su última hora; y, viéndose tan afligido y congojado,
maldecía el bálsamo y al ladrón que se lo había dado. Viéndole así don
Quijote, le dijo:
— Yo creo, Sancho, que todo este mal te viene de no ser armado caballero,
porque tengo para mí que este licor no debe de aprovechar a los que no lo
son.
— Si eso sabía vuestra merced —replicó Sancho—, ¡mal haya yo y toda mi
parentela!, ¿para qué consintió que lo gustase?
En esto, hizo su operación el brebaje, y comenzó el pobre escudero a
desaguarse por entrambas canales, con tanta priesa que la estera de enea,
sobre quien se había vuelto a echar, ni la manta de anjeo con que se
cubría, fueron más de provecho. Sudaba y trasudaba con tales parasismos y
accidentes, que no solamente él, sino todos pensaron que se le acababa la
vida. Duróle esta borrasca y mala andanza casi dos horas, al cabo de las
cuales no quedó como su amo, sino tan molido y quebrantado que no se podía
tener.
Pero don Quijote, que, como se ha dicho, se sintió aliviado y sano, quiso
partirse luego a buscar aventuras, pareciéndole que todo el tiempo que allí
se tardaba era quitársele al mundo y a los en él menesterosos de su favor y
amparo; y más con la seguridad y confianza que llevaba en su bálsamo. Y
así, forzado deste deseo, él mismo ensilló a Rocinante y enalbardó al
jumento de su escudero, a quien también ayudó a vestir y a subir en el
asno. Púsose luego a caballo, y, llegándose a un rincón de la venta, asió
de un lanzón que allí estaba, para que le sirviese de lanza.
Estábanle mirando todos cuantos había en la venta, que pasaban de más de
veinte personas; mirábale también la hija del ventero, y él también no
quitaba los ojos della, y de cuando en cuando arrojaba un sospiro que
parecía que le arrancaba de lo profundo de sus entrañas, y todos pensaban
que debía de ser del dolor que sentía en las costillas; a lo menos,
pensábanlo aquellos que la noche antes le habían visto bizmar.
Ya que estuvieron los dos a caballo, puesto a la puerta de la venta, llamó
al ventero, y con voz muy reposada y grave le dijo:
— Muchas y muy grandes son las mercedes, señor alcaide, que en este vuestro
castillo he recebido, y quedo obligadísimo a agradecéroslas todos los días
de mi vida. Si os las puedo pagar en haceros vengado de algún soberbio que
os haya fecho algún agravio, sabed que mi oficio no es otro sino valer a
los que poco pueden, y vengar a los que reciben tuertos, y castigar
alevosías. Recorred vuestra memoria, y si halláis alguna cosa deste jaez
que encomendarme, no hay sino decilla; que yo os prometo, por la orden de
caballero que recebí, de faceros satisfecho y pagado a toda vuestra
voluntad.
El ventero le respondió con el mesmo sosiego:
— Señor caballero, yo no tengo necesidad de que vuestra merced me vengue
ningún agravio, porque yo sé tomar la venganza que me parece, cuando se me
hacen. Sólo he menester que vuestra merced me pague el gasto que esta noche
ha hecho en la venta, así de la paja y cebada de sus dos bestias, como de
la cena y camas.
— Luego, ¿venta es ésta? —replicó don Quijote.
— Y muy honrada —respondió el ventero.
— Engañado he vivido hasta aquí —respondió don Quijote—, que en verdad que
pensé que era castillo, y no malo; pero, pues es ansí que no es castillo
sino venta, lo que se podrá hacer por agora es que perdonéis por la paga,
que yo no puedo contravenir a la orden de los caballeros andantes, de los
cuales sé cierto, sin que hasta ahora haya leído cosa en contrario, que
jamás pagaron posada ni otra cosa en venta donde estuviesen, porque se les
debe de fuero y de derecho cualquier buen acogimiento que se les hiciere,
en pago del insufrible trabajo que padecen buscando las aventuras de noche
y de día, en invierno y en verano, a pie y a caballo, con sed y con hambre,
con calor y con frío, sujetos a todas las inclemencias del cielo y a todos
los incómodos de la tierra.
— Poco tengo yo que ver en eso —respondió el ventero—; págueseme lo que se
me debe, y dejémonos de cuentos ni de caballerías, que yo no tengo cuenta
con otra cosa que con cobrar mi hacienda.
— Vos sois un sandio y mal hostalero —respondió don Quijote.
Y, poniendo piernas al Rocinante y terciando su lanzón, se salió de la
venta sin que nadie le detuviese, y él, sin mirar si le seguía su escudero,
se alongó un buen trecho.
El ventero, que le vio ir y que no le pagaba, acudió a cobrar de Sancho
Panza, el cual dijo que, pues su señor no había querido pagar, que tampoco
él pagaría; porque, siendo él escudero de caballero andante, como era, la
mesma regla y razón corría por él como por su amo en no pagar cosa alguna
en los mesones y ventas. Amohinóse mucho desto el ventero, y amenazóle que
si no le pagaba, que lo cobraría de modo que le pesase. A lo cual Sancho
respondió que, por la ley de caballería que su amo había recebido, no
pagaría un solo cornado, aunque le costase la vida; porque no había de
perder por él la buena y antigua usanza de los caballeros andantes, ni se
habían de quejar dél los escuderos de los tales que estaban por venir al
mundo, reprochándole el quebrantamiento de tan justo fuero.
Quiso la mala suerte del desdichado Sancho que, entre la gente que estaba
en la venta, se hallasen cuatro perailes de Segovia, tres agujeros del
Potro de Córdoba y dos vecinos de la Heria de Sevilla, gente alegre, bien
intencionada, maleante y juguetona, los cuales, casi como instigados y
movidos de un mesmo espíritu, se llegaron a Sancho, y, apeándole del asno,
uno dellos entró por la manta de la cama del huésped, y, echándole en ella,
alzaron los ojos y vieron que el techo era algo más bajo de lo que habían
menester para su obra, y determinaron salirse al corral, que tenía por
límite el cielo. Y allí, puesto Sancho en mitad de la manta, comenzaron a
levantarle en alto y a holgarse con él como con perro por carnestolendas.
Las voces que el mísero manteado daba fueron tantas, que llegaron a los
oídos de su amo; el cual, determinándose a escuchar atentamente, creyó que
alguna nueva aventura le venía, hasta que claramente conoció que el que
gritaba era su escudero; y, volviendo las riendas, con un penado galope
llegó a la venta, y, hallándola cerrada, la rodeó por ver si hallaba por
donde entrar; pero no hubo llegado a las paredes del corral, que no eran
muy altas, cuando vio el mal juego que se le hacía a su escudero. Viole
bajar y subir por el aire, con tanta gracia y presteza que, si la cólera le
dejara, tengo para mí que se riera. Probó a subir desde el caballo a las
bardas, pero estaba tan molido y quebrantado que aun apearse no pudo; y
así, desde encima del caballo, comenzó a decir tantos denuestos y baldones
a los que a Sancho manteaban, que no es posible acertar a escribillos; mas
no por esto cesaban ellos de su risa y de su obra, ni el volador Sancho
dejaba sus quejas, mezcladas ya con amenazas, ya con ruegos; mas todo
aprovechaba poco, ni aprovechó, hasta que de puro cansados le dejaron.
Trujéronle allí su asno, y, subiéndole encima, le arroparon con su gabán. Y
la compasiva de Maritornes, viéndole tan fatigado, le pareció ser bien
socorrelle con un jarro de agua, y así, se le trujo del pozo, por ser más
frío. Tomóle Sancho, y llevándole a la boca, se paró a las voces que su amo
le daba, diciendo:
— ¡Hijo Sancho, no bebas agua! ¡Hijo, no la bebas, que te matará! ¿Ves? Aquí
tengo el santísimo bálsamo —y enseñábale la alcuza del brebaje—, que con
dos gotas que dél bebas sanarás sin duda.
A estas voces volvió Sancho los ojos, como de través, y dijo con otras
mayores:
— ¿Por dicha hásele olvidado a vuestra merced como yo no soy caballero, o
quiere que acabe de vomitar las entrañas que me quedaron de anoche?
Guárdese su licor con todos los diablos y déjeme a mí.
Y el acabar de decir esto y el comenzar a beber todo fue uno; mas, como al
primer trago vio que era agua, no quiso pasar adelante, y rogó a Maritornes
que se le trujese de vino, y así lo hizo ella de muy buena voluntad, y lo
pagó de su mesmo dinero; porque, en efecto, se dice della que, aunque
estaba en aquel trato, tenía unas sombras y lejos de cristiana.
Así como bebió Sancho, dio de los carcaños a su asno, y, abriéndole la
puerta de la venta de par en par, se salió della, muy contento de no haber
pagado nada y de haber salido con su intención, aunque había sido a costa
de sus acostumbrados fiadores, que eran sus espaldas. Verdad es que el
ventero se quedó con sus alforjas en pago de lo que se le debía; mas Sancho
no las echó menos, según salió turbado. Quiso el ventero atrancar bien la
puerta así como le vio fuera, mas no lo consintieron los manteadores, que
eran gente que, aunque don Quijote fuera verdaderamente de los caballeros
andantes de la Tabla Redonda, no le estimaran en dos ardites.
Capítulo XVIII. Donde se cuentan las razones que pasó Sancho Panza con su
señor Don Quijote, con otras aventuras dignas de ser contadas
Llegó Sancho a su amo marchito y desmayado; tanto, que no podía arrear a su
jumento. Cuando así le vio don Quijote, le dijo:
— Ahora acabo de creer, Sancho bueno, que aquel castillo o venta, de que es
encantado sin duda; porque aquellos que tan atrozmente tomaron pasatiempo
contigo, ¿qué podían ser sino fantasmas y gente del otro mundo? Y confirmo
esto por haber visto que, cuando estaba por las bardas del corral mirando
los actos de tu triste tragedia, no me fue posible subir por ellas, ni
menos pude apearme de Rocinante, porque me debían de tener encantado; que
te juro, por la fe de quien soy, que si pudiera subir o apearme, que yo te
hiciera vengado de manera que aquellos follones y malandrines se acordaran
de la burla para siempre, aunque en ello supiera contravenir a las leyes de
la caballería, que, como ya muchas veces te he dicho, no consienten que
caballero ponga mano contra quien no lo sea, si no fuere en defensa de su
propria vida y persona, en caso de urgente y gran necesidad.
— También me vengara yo si pudiera, fuera o no fuera armado caballero, pero
no pude; aunque tengo para mí que aquellos que se holgaron conmigo no eran
fantasmas ni hombres encantados, como vuestra merced dice, sino hombres de
carne y hueso como nosotros; y todos, según los oí nombrar cuando me
volteaban, tenían sus nombres: que el uno se llamaba Pedro Martínez, y el
otro Tenorio Hernández, y el ventero oí que se llamaba Juan Palomeque el
Zurdo. Así que, señor, el no poder saltar las bardas del corral, ni apearse
del caballo, en ál estuvo que en encantamentos. Y lo que yo saco en limpio
de todo esto es que estas aventuras que andamos buscando, al cabo al cabo,
nos han de traer a tantas desventuras que no sepamos cuál es nuestro pie
derecho. Y lo que sería mejor y más acertado, según mi poco entendimiento,
fuera el volvernos a nuestro lugar, ahora que es tiempo de la siega y de
entender en la hacienda, dejándonos de andar de Ceca en Meca y de zoca en
colodra, como dicen.
— ¡Qué poco sabes, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, de achaque de caballería!
Calla y ten paciencia, que día vendrá donde veas por vista de ojos cuán
honrosa cosa es andar en este ejercicio. Si no, dime: ¿qué mayor contento
puede haber en el mundo, o qué gusto puede igualarse al de vencer una
batalla y al de triunfar de su enemigo? Ninguno, sin duda alguna.
— Así debe de ser —respondió Sancho—, puesto que yo no lo sé; sólo sé que,
después que somos caballeros andantes, o vuestra merced lo es (que yo no
hay para qué me cuente en tan honroso número), jamás hemos vencido batalla
alguna, si no fue la del vizcaíno, y aun de aquélla salió vuestra merced
con media oreja y media celada menos; que, después acá, todo ha sido palos
y más palos, puñadas y más puñadas, llevando yo de ventaja el manteamiento
y haberme sucedido por personas encantadas, de quien no puedo vengarme,
para saber hasta dónde llega el gusto del vencimiento del enemigo, como
vuestra merced dice.
— Ésa es la pena que yo tengo y la que tú debes tener, Sancho —respondió don
Quijote—; pero, de aquí adelante, yo procuraré haber a las manos alguna
espada hecha por tal maestría, que al que la trujere consigo no le puedan
hacer ningún género de encantamentos; y aun podría ser que me deparase la
ventura aquella de Amadís, cuando se llamaba el Caballero de la Ardiente
Espada, que fue una de las mejores espadas que tuvo caballero en el mundo,
porque, fuera que tenía la virtud dicha, cortaba como una navaja, y no
había armadura, por fuerte y encantada que fuese, que se le parase delante.
— Yo soy tan venturoso —dijo Sancho— que, cuando eso fuese y vuestra merced
viniese a hallar espada semejante, sólo vendría a servir y aprovechar a los
armados caballeros, como el bálsamo; y los escuderos, que se los papen
duelos.
— No temas eso, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que mejor lo hará el cielo
contigo.
Es estos coloquios iban don Quijote y su escudero, cuando vio don Quijote
que por el camino que iban venía hacia ellos una grande y espesa polvareda;
y, en viéndola, se volvió a Sancho y le dijo:
— Éste es el día, ¡oh Sancho!, en el cual se ha de ver el bien que me tiene
guardado mi suerte; éste es el día, digo, en que se ha de mostrar, tanto
como en otro alguno, el valor de mi brazo, y en el que tengo de hacer obras
que queden escritas en el libro de la Fama por todos los venideros siglos.
¿Ves aquella polvareda que allí se levanta, Sancho? Pues toda es cuajada de
un copiosísimo ejército que de diversas e innumerables gentes por allí
viene marchando.
— A esa cuenta, dos deben de ser —dijo Sancho—, porque desta parte contraria
se levanta asimesmo otra semejante polvareda.
Volvió a mirarlo don Quijote, y vio que así era la verdad; y, alegrándose
sobremanera, pensó, sin duda alguna, que eran dos ejércitos que venían a
embestirse y a encontrarse en mitad de aquella espaciosa llanura; porque
tenía a todas horas y momentos llena la fantasía de aquellas batallas,
encantamentos, sucesos, desatinos, amores, desafíos, que en los libros de
caballerías se cuentan, y todo cuanto hablaba, pensaba o hacía era
encaminado a cosas semejantes. Y la polvareda que había visto la levantaban
dos grandes manadas de ovejas y carneros que, por aquel mesmo camino, de
dos diferentes partes venían, las cuales, con el polvo, no se echaron de
ver hasta que llegaron cerca. Y con tanto ahínco afirmaba don Quijote que
eran ejércitos, que Sancho lo vino a creer y a decirle:
— Señor, ¿pues qué hemos de hacer nosotros?
— ¿Qué? —dijo don Quijote—: favorecer y ayudar a los menesterosos y
desvalidos. Y has de saber, Sancho, que este que viene por nuestra frente
le conduce y guía el grande emperador Alifanfarón, señor de la grande isla
Trapobana; este otro que a mis espaldas marcha es el de su enemigo, el rey
de los garamantas, Pentapolén del Arremangado Brazo, porque siempre entra
en las batallas con el brazo derecho desnudo.
— Pues, ¿por qué se quieren tan mal estos dos señores? —preguntó Sancho.
— Quierénse mal —respondió don Quijote— porque este Alefanfarón es un
foribundo pagano y está enamorado de la hija de Pentapolín, que es una muy
fermosa y además agraciada señora, y es cristiana, y su padre no se la
quiere entregar al rey pagano si no deja primero la ley de su falso profeta
Mahoma y se vuelve a la suya.
— ¡Para mis barbas —dijo Sancho—, si no hace muy bien Pentapolín, y que le
tengo de ayudar en cuanto pudiere!
— En eso harás lo que debes, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, porque, para entrar
en batallas semejantes, no se requiere ser armado caballero.
— Bien se me alcanza eso —respondió Sancho—, pero, ¿dónde pondremos a este
asno que estemos ciertos de hallarle después de pasada la refriega? Porque
el entrar en ella en semejante caballería no creo que está en uso hasta
agora.
— Así es verdad —dijo don Quijote—. Lo que puedes hacer dél es dejarle a sus
aventuras, ora se pierda o no, porque serán tantos los caballos que
tendremos, después que salgamos vencedores, que aun corre peligro Rocinante
no le trueque por otro. Pero estáme atento y mira, que te quiero dar cuenta
de los caballeros más principales que en estos dos ejércitos vienen. Y,
para que mejor los veas y notes, retirémonos a aquel altillo que allí se
hace, de donde se deben de descubrir los dos ejércitos.
Hiciéronlo ansí, y pusierónse sobre una loma, desde la cual se vieran bien
las dos manadas que a don Quijote se le hicieron ejército, si las nubes del
polvo que levantaban no les turbara y cegara la vista; pero, con todo esto,
viendo en su imaginación lo que no veía ni había, con voz levantada comenzó
a decir:
— Aquel caballero que allí ves de las armas jaldes, que trae en el escudo un
león coronado, rendido a los pies de una doncella, es el valeroso
Laurcalco, señor de la Puente de Plata; el otro de las armas de las flores
de oro, que trae en el escudo tres coronas de plata en campo azul, es el
temido Micocolembo, gran duque de Quirocia; el otro de los miembros
giganteos, que está a su derecha mano, es el nunca medroso Brandabarbarán
de Boliche, señor de las tres Arabias, que viene armado de aquel cuero de
serpiente, y tiene por escudo una puerta que, según es fama, es una de las
del templo que derribó Sansón, cuando con su muerte se vengó de sus
enemigos. Pero vuelve los ojos a estotra parte y verás delante y en la
frente destotro ejército al siempre vencedor y jamás vencido Timonel de
Carcajona, príncipe de la Nueva Vizcaya, que viene armado con las armas
partidas a cuarteles, azules, verdes, blancas y amarillas, y trae en el
escudo un gato de oro en campo leonado, con una letra que dice: Miau, que
es el principio del nombre de su dama, que, según se dice, es la sin par
Miulina, hija del duque Alfeñiquén del Algarbe; el otro, que carga y oprime
los lomos de aquella poderosa alfana, que trae las armas como nieve blancas
y el escudo blanco y sin empresa alguna, es un caballero novel, de nación
francés, llamado Pierres Papín, señor de las baronías de Utrique; el otro,
que bate las ijadas con los herrados carcaños a aquella pintada y ligera
cebra, y trae las armas de los veros azules, es el poderoso duque de
Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, que trae por empresa en el escudo una
esparraguera, con una letra en castellano que dice así: Rastrea mi suerte.
Y desta manera fue nombrando muchos caballeros del uno y del otro
escuadrón, que él se imaginaba, y a todos les dio sus armas, colores,
empresas y motes de improviso, llevado de la imaginación de su nunca vista
locura; y, sin parar, prosiguió diciendo:
— A este escuadrón frontero forman y hacen gentes de diversas naciones: aquí
están los que bebían las dulces aguas del famoso Janto; los montuosos que
pisan los masílicos campos; los que criban el finísimo y menudo oro en la
felice Arabia; los que gozan las famosas y frescas riberas del claro
Termodonte; los que sangran por muchas y diversas vías al dorado Pactolo;
los númidas, dudosos en sus promesas; los persas, arcos y flechas famosos;
los partos, los medos, que pelean huyendo; los árabes, de mudables casas;
los citas, tan crueles como blancos; los etiopes, de horadados labios, y
otras infinitas naciones, cuyos rostros conozco y veo, aunque de los
nombres no me acuerdo. En estotro escuadrón vienen los que beben las
corrientes cristalinas del olivífero Betis; los que tersan y pulen sus
rostros con el licor del siempre rico y dorado Tajo; los que gozan las
provechosas aguas del divino Genil; los que pisan los tartesios campos, de
pastos abundantes; los que se alegran en los elíseos jerezanos prados; los
manchegos, ricos y coronados de rubias espigas; los de hierro vestidos,
reliquias antiguas de la sangre goda; los que en Pisuerga se bañan, famoso
por la mansedumbre de su corriente; los que su ganado apacientan en las
estendidas dehesas del tortuoso Guadiana, celebrado por su escondido curso;
los que tiemblan con el frío del silvoso Pirineo y con los blancos copos
del levantado Apenino; finalmente, cuantos toda la Europa en sí contiene y
encierra.
¡Válame Dios, y cuántas provincias dijo, cuántas naciones nombró, dándole a
cada una, con maravillosa presteza, los atributos que le pertenecían, todo
absorto y empapado en lo que había leído en sus libros mentirosos!
Estaba Sancho Panza colgado de sus palabras, sin hablar ninguna, y, de
cuando en cuando, volvía la cabeza a ver si veía los caballeros y gigantes
que su amo nombraba; y, como no descubría a ninguno, le dijo:
— Señor, encomiendo al diablo hombre, ni gigante, ni caballero de cuantos
vuestra merced dice parece por todo esto; a lo menos, yo no los veo; quizá
todo debe ser encantamento, como las fantasmas de anoche.
— ¿Cómo dices eso? —respondió don Quijote—. ¿No oyes el relinchar de los
caballos, el tocar de los clarines, el ruido de los atambores?
— No oigo otra cosa —respondió Sancho— sino muchos balidos de ovejas y
carneros.
Y así era la verdad, porque ya llegaban cerca los dos rebaños.
— El miedo que tienes —dijo don Quijote— te hace, Sancho, que ni veas ni
oyas a derechas; porque uno de los efectos del miedo es turbar los sentidos
y hacer que las cosas no parezcan lo que son; y si es que tanto temes,
retírate a una parte y déjame solo, que solo basto a dar la victoria a la
parte a quien yo diere mi ayuda.
Y, diciendo esto, puso las espuelas a Rocinante, y, puesta la lanza en el
ristre, bajó de la costezuela como un rayo. Diole voces Sancho, diciéndole:
— ¡Vuélvase vuestra merced, señor don Quijote, que voto a Dios que son
carneros y ovejas las que va a embestir! ¡Vuélvase, desdichado del padre
que me engendró! ¿Qué locura es ésta? Mire que no hay gigante ni caballero
alguno, ni gatos, ni armas, ni escudos partidos ni enteros, ni veros azules
ni endiablados. ¿Qué es lo que hace? ¡Pecador soy yo a Dios!
Ni por ésas volvió don Quijote; antes, en altas voces, iba diciendo:
— ¡Ea, caballeros, los que seguís y militáis debajo de las banderas del
valeroso emperador Pentapolín del Arremangado Brazo, seguidme todos: veréis
cuán fácilmente le doy venganza de su enemigo Alefanfarón de la Trapobana!
Esto diciendo, se entró por medio del escuadrón de las ovejas, y comenzó de
alanceallas con tanto coraje y denuedo como si de veras alanceara a sus
mortales enemigos. Los pastores y ganaderos que con la manada venían
dábanle voces que no hiciese aquello; pero, viendo que no aprovechaban,
desciñéronse las hondas y comenzaron a saludalle los oídos con piedras como
el puño. Don Quijote no se curaba de las piedras; antes, discurriendo a
todas partes, decía:
— ¿Adónde estás, soberbio Alifanfuón? Vente a mí; que un caballero solo soy,
que desea, de solo a solo, probar tus fuerzas y quitarte la vida, en pena
de la que das al valeroso Pentapolín Garamanta.
Llegó en esto una peladilla de arroyo, y, dándole en un lado, le sepultó
dos costillas en el cuerpo. Viéndose tan maltrecho, creyó sin duda que
estaba muerto o malferido, y, acordándose de su licor, sacó su alcuza y
púsosela a la boca, y comenzó a echar licor en el estómago; mas, antes que
acabase de envasar lo que a él le parecía que era bastante, llegó otra
almendra y diole en la mano y en el alcuza tan de lleno que se la hizo
pedazos, llevándole de camino tres o cuatro dientes y muelas de la boca, y
machucándole malamente dos dedos de la mano.
Tal fue el golpe primero, y tal el segundo, que le fue forzoso al pobre
caballero dar consigo del caballo abajo. Llegáronse a él los pastores y
creyeron que le habían muerto; y así, con mucha priesa, recogieron su
ganado, y cargaron de las reses muertas, que pasaban de siete, y, sin
averiguar otra cosa, se fueron.
Estábase todo este tiempo Sancho sobre la cuesta, mirando las locuras que
su amo hacía, y arrancábase las barbas, maldiciendo la hora y el punto en
que la fortuna se le había dado a conocer. Viéndole, pues, caído en el
suelo, y que ya los pastores se habían ido, bajó de la cuesta y llegóse a
él, y hallóle de muy mal arte, aunque no había perdido el sentido, y
díjole:
— ¿No le decía yo, señor don Quijote, que se volviese, que los que iba a
acometer no eran ejércitos, sino manadas de carneros?
— Como eso puede desparecer y contrahacer aquel ladrón del sabio mi enemigo.
Sábete, Sancho, que es muy fácil cosa a los tales hacernos parecer lo que
quieren, y este maligno que me persigue, envidioso de la gloria que vio que
yo había de alcanzar desta batalla, ha vuelto los escuadrones de enemigos
en manadas de ovejas. Si no, haz una cosa, Sancho, por mi vida, porque te
desengañes y veas ser verdad lo que te digo: sube en tu asno y síguelos
bonitamente, y verás cómo, en alejándose de aquí algún poco, se vuelven en
su ser primero, y, dejando de ser carneros, son hombres hechos y derechos,
como yo te los pinté primero... Pero no vayas agora, que he menester tu
favor y ayuda; llégate a mí y mira cuántas muelas y dientes me faltan, que
me parece que no me ha quedado ninguno en la boca.
Llegóse Sancho tan cerca que casi le metía los ojos en la boca, y fue a
tiempo que ya había obrado el bálsamo en el estómago de don Quijote; y, al
tiempo que Sancho llegó a mirarle la boca, arrojó de sí, más recio que una
escopeta, cuanto dentro tenía, y dio con todo ello en las barbas del
compasivo escudero.
— ¡Santa María! —dijo Sancho—, ¿y qué es esto que me ha sucedido? Sin duda,
este pecador está herido de muerte, pues vomita sangre por la boca.
Pero, reparando un poco más en ello, echó de ver en la color, sabor y olor,
que no era sangre, sino el bálsamo de la alcuza que él le había visto
beber; y fue tanto el asco que tomó que, revolviéndosele el estómago,
vomitó las tripas sobre su mismo señor, y quedaron entrambos como de
perlas. Acudió Sancho a su asno para sacar de las alforjas con qué
limpiarse y con qué curar a su amo; y, como no las halló, estuvo a punto de
perder el juicio. Maldíjose de nuevo, y propuso en su corazón de dejar a su
amo y volverse a su tierra, aunque perdiese el salario de lo servido y las
esperanzas del gobierno de la prometida ínsula.
Levantóse en esto don Quijote, y, puesta la mano izquierda en la boca,
porque no se le acabasen de salir los dientes, asió con la otra las riendas
de Rocinante, que nunca se había movido de junto a su amo —tal era de leal
y bien acondicionado—, y fuese adonde su escudero estaba, de pechos sobre
su asno, con la mano en la mejilla, en guisa de hombre pensativo además. Y,
viéndole don Quijote de aquella manera, con muestras de tanta tristeza, le
dijo:
— Sábete, Sancho, que no es un hombre más que otro si no hace más que otro.
Todas estas borrascas que nos suceden son señales de que presto ha de
serenar el tiempo y han de sucedernos bien las cosas; porque no es posible
que el mal ni el bien sean durables, y de aquí se sigue que, habiendo
durado mucho el mal, el bien está ya cerca. Así que, no debes congojarte
por las desgracias que a mí me suceden, pues a ti no te cabe parte dellas.
— ¿Cómo no? —respondió Sancho—. Por ventura, el que ayer mantearon, ¿era
otro que el hijo de mi padre? Y las alforjas que hoy me faltan, con todas
mis alhajas, ¿son de otro que del mismo?
— ¿Que te faltan las alforjas, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote.
— Sí que me faltan —respondió Sancho.
— Dese modo, no tenemos qué comer hoy —replicó don Quijote.
— Eso fuera —respondió Sancho— cuando faltaran por estos prados las yerbas
que vuestra merced dice que conoce, con que suelen suplir semejantes faltas
los tan malaventurados andantes caballeros como vuestra merced es.
— Con todo eso —respondió don Quijote—, tomara yo ahora más aína un cuartal
de pan, o una hogaza y dos cabezas de sardinas arenques, que cuantas yerbas
describe Dioscórides, aunque fuera el ilustrado por el doctor Laguna. Mas,
con todo esto, sube en tu jumento, Sancho el bueno, y vente tras mí; que
Dios, que es proveedor de todas las cosas, no nos ha de faltar, y más
andando tan en su servicio como andamos, pues no falta a los mosquitos del
aire, ni a los gusanillos de la tierra, ni a los renacuajos del agua; y es
tan piadoso que hace salir su sol sobre los buenos y los malos, y llueve
sobre los injustos y justos.
— Más bueno era vuestra merced —dijo Sancho— para predicador que para
caballero andante.
— De todo sabían y han de saber los caballeros andantes, Sancho —dijo don
Quijote—, porque caballero andante hubo en los pasados siglos que así se
paraba a hacer un sermón o plática, en mitad de un campo real, como si
fuera graduado por la Universidad de París; de donde se infiere que nunca
la lanza embotó la pluma, ni la pluma la lanza.
— Ahora bien, sea así como vuestra merced dice —respondió Sancho—, vamos
ahora de aquí, y procuremos donde alojar esta noche, y quiera Dios que sea
en parte donde no haya mantas, ni manteadores, ni fantasmas, ni moros
encantados; que si los hay, daré al diablo el hato y el garabato.
— Pídeselo tú a Dios, hijo —dijo don Quijote—, y guía tú por donde
quisieres, que esta vez quiero dejar a tu eleción el alojarnos. Pero dame
acá la mano y atiéntame con el dedo, y mira bien cuántos dientes y muelas
me faltan deste lado derecho de la quijada alta, que allí siento el dolor.
Metió Sancho los dedos, y, estándole tentando, le dijo:
— ¿Cuántas muelas solía vuestra merced tener en esta parte?
— Cuatro —respondió don Quijote—, fuera de la cordal, todas enteras y muy
sanas.
— Mire vuestra merced bien lo que dice, señor —respondió Sancho.
— Digo cuatro, si no eran cinco —respondió don Quijote—, porque en toda mi
vida me han sacado diente ni muela de la boca, ni se me ha caído ni comido
de neguijón ni de reuma alguna.
— Pues en esta parte de abajo —dijo Sancho— no tiene vuestra merced más de
dos muelas y media, y en la de arriba, ni media ni ninguna, que toda está
rasa como la palma de la mano.
— ¡Sin ventura yo! —dijo don Quijote, oyendo las tristes nuevas que su
escudero le daba—, que más quisiera que me hubieran derribado un brazo,
como no fuera el de la espada; porque te hago saber, Sancho, que la boca
sin muelas es como molino sin piedra, y en mucho más se ha de estimar un
diente que un diamante. Mas a todo esto estamos sujetos los que profesamos
la estrecha orden de la caballería. Sube, amigo, y guía, que yo te seguiré
al paso que quisieres.
Hízolo así Sancho, y encaminóse hacia donde le pareció que podía hallar
acogimiento, sin salir del camino real, que por allí iba muy seguido.
Yéndose, pues, poco a poco, porque el dolor de las quijadas de don Quijote
no le dejaba sosegar ni atender a darse priesa, quiso Sancho entretenelle y
divertille diciéndole alguna cosa; y, entre otras que le dijo, fue lo que
se dirá en el siguiente capítulo.
Capítulo XIX. De las discretas razones que Sancho pasaba con su amo, y de
la aventura que le sucedió con un cuerpo muerto, con otros acontecimientos
famosos
— Paréceme, señor mío, que todas estas desventuras que estos días nos han
sucedido, sin duda alguna han sido pena del pecado cometido por vuestra
merced contra la orden de su caballería, no habiendo cumplido el juramento
que hizo de no comer pan a manteles ni con la reina folgar, con todo
aquello que a esto se sigue y vuestra merced juró de cumplir, hasta quitar
aquel almete de Malandrino, o como se llama el moro, que no me acuerdo
bien.
— Tienes mucha razón, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—; mas, para decirte verdad,
ello se me había pasado de la memoria; y también puedes tener por cierto
que por la culpa de no habérmelo tú acordado en tiempo te sucedió aquello
de la manta; pero yo haré la enmienda, que modos hay de composición en la
orden de la caballería para todo.
— Pues, ¿juré yo algo, por dicha? —respondió Sancho.
— No importa que no hayas jurado —dijo don Quijote—: basta que yo entiendo
que de participantes no estás muy seguro, y, por sí o por no, no será malo
proveernos de remedio.
— Pues si ello es así —dijo Sancho—, mire vuestra merced no se le torne a
olvidar esto, como lo del juramento; quizá les volverá la gana a las
fantasmas de solazarse otra vez conmigo, y aun con vuestra merced si le ven
tan pertinaz.
En estas y otras pláticas les tomó la noche en mitad del camino, sin tener
ni descubrir donde aquella noche se recogiesen; y lo que no había de bueno
en ello era que perecían de hambre; que, con la falta de las alforjas, les
faltó toda la despensa y matalotaje. Y, para acabar de confirmar esta
desgracia, les sucedió una aventura que, sin artificio alguno,
verdaderamente lo parecía. Y fue que la noche cerró con alguna escuridad;
pero, con todo esto, caminaban, creyendo Sancho que, pues aquel camino era
real, a una o dos leguas, de buena razón, hallaría en él alguna venta.
Yendo, pues, desta manera, la noche escura, el escudero hambriento y el amo
con gana de comer, vieron que por el mesmo camino que iban venían hacia
ellos gran multitud de lumbres, que no parecían sino estrellas que se
movían. Pasmóse Sancho en viéndolas, y don Quijote no las tuvo todas
consigo; tiró el uno del cabestro a su asno, y el otro de las riendas a su
rocino, y estuvieron quedos, mirando atentamente lo que podía ser aquello,
y vieron que las lumbres se iban acercando a ellos, y mientras más se
llegaban, mayores parecían; a cuya vista Sancho comenzó a temblar como un
azogado, y los cabellos de la cabeza se le erizaron a don Quijote; el cual,
animándose un poco, dijo:
— Ésta, sin duda, Sancho, debe de ser grandísima y peligrosísima aventura,
donde será necesario que yo muestre todo mi valor y esfuerzo.
— ¡Desdichado de mí! —respondió Sancho—; si acaso esta aventura fuese de
fantasmas, como me lo va pareciendo, ¿adónde habrá costillas que la sufran?
— Por más fantasmas que sean —dijo don Quijote—, no consentiré yo que te
toque en el pelo de la ropa; que si la otra vez se burlaron contigo, fue
porque no pude yo saltar las paredes del corral, pero ahora estamos en
campo raso, donde podré yo como quisiere esgremir mi espada.
— Y si le encantan y entomecen, como la otra vez lo hicieron —dijo Sancho—,
¿qué aprovechará estar en campo abierto o no?
— Con todo eso —replicó don Quijote—, te ruego, Sancho, que tengas buen
ánimo, que la experiencia te dará a entender el que yo tengo.
— Sí tendré, si a Dios place —respondió Sancho.
Y, apartándose los dos a un lado del camino, tornaron a mirar atentamente
lo que aquello de aquellas lumbres que caminaban podía ser; y de allí a muy
poco descubrieron muchos encamisados, cuya temerosa visión de todo punto
remató el ánimo de Sancho Panza, el cual comenzó a dar diente con diente,
como quien tiene frío de cuartana; y creció más el batir y dentellear
cuando distintamente vieron lo que era, porque descubrieron hasta veinte
encamisados, todos a caballo, con sus hachas encendidas en las manos;
detrás de los cuales venía una litera cubierta de luto, a la cual seguían
otros seis de a caballo, enlutados hasta los pies de las mulas; que bien
vieron que no eran caballos en el sosiego con que caminaban. Iban los
encamisados murmurando entre sí, con una voz baja y compasiva. Esta estraña
visión, a tales horas y en tal despoblado, bien bastaba para poner miedo en
el corazón de Sancho, y aun en el de su amo; y así fuera en cuanto a don
Quijote, que ya Sancho había dado al través con todo su esfuerzo. Lo
contrario le avino a su amo, al cual en aquel punto se le representó en su
imaginación al vivo que aquélla era una de las aventuras de sus libros.
Figurósele que la litera eran andas donde debía de ir algún mal ferido o
muerto caballero, cuya venganza a él solo estaba reservada; y, sin hacer
otro discurso, enristró su lanzón, púsose bien en la silla, y con gentil
brío y continente se puso en la mitad del camino por donde los encamisados
forzosamente habían de pasar, y cuando los vio cerca alzó la voz y dijo:
— Deteneos, caballeros, o quienquiera que seáis, y dadme cuenta de quién
sois, de dónde venís, adónde vais, qué es lo que en aquellas andas lleváis;
que, según las muestras, o vosotros habéis fecho, o vos han fecho, algún
desaguisado, y conviene y es menester que yo lo sepa, o bien para
castigaros del mal que fecistes, o bien para vengaros del tuerto que vos
ficieron.
— Vamos de priesa —respondió uno de los encamisados— y está la venta lejos,
y no nos podemos detener a dar tanta cuenta como pedís.
Y, picando la mula, pasó adelante. Sintióse desta respuesta grandemente don
Quijote, y, trabando del freno, dijo:
— Deteneos y sed más bien criado, y dadme cuenta de lo que os he preguntado;
si no, conmigo sois todos en batalla.
Era la mula asombradiza, y al tomarla del freno se espantó de manera que,
alzándose en los pies, dio con su dueño por las ancas en el suelo. Un mozo
que iba a pie, viendo caer al encamisado, comenzó a denostar a don Quijote,
el cual, ya encolerizado, sin esperar más, enristrando su lanzón, arremetió
a uno de los enlutados, y, mal ferido, dio con él en tierra; y,
revolviéndose por los demás, era cosa de ver con la presteza que los
acometía y desbarataba; que no parecía sino que en aquel instante le habían
nacido alas a Rocinante, según andaba de ligero y orgulloso.
Todos los encamisados era gente medrosa y sin armas, y así, con facilidad,
en un momento dejaron la refriega y comenzaron a correr por aquel campo con
las hachas encendidas, que no parecían sino a los de las máscaras que en
noche de regocijo y fiesta corren. Los enlutados, asimesmo, revueltos y
envueltos en sus faldamentos y lobas, no se podían mover; así que, muy a su
salvo, don Quijote los apaleó a todos y les hizo dejar el sitio mal de su
grado, porque todos pensaron que aquél no era hombre, sino diablo del
infierno que les salía a quitar el cuerpo muerto que en la litera llevaban.
Todo lo miraba Sancho, admirado del ardimiento de su señor, y decía entre
sí:
— Sin duda este mi amo es tan valiente y esforzado como él dice.
Estaba una hacha ardiendo en el suelo, junto al primero que derribó la
mula, a cuya luz le pudo ver don Quijote; y, llegándose a él, le puso la
punta del lanzón en el rostro, diciéndole que se rindiese; si no, que le
mataría. A lo cual respondió el caído:
— Harto rendido estoy, pues no me puedo mover, que tengo una pierna
quebrada; suplico a vuestra merced, si es caballero cristiano, que no me
mate; que cometerá un gran sacrilegio, que soy licenciado y tengo las
primeras órdenes.
— Pues, ¿quién diablos os ha traído aquí —dijo don Quijote—, siendo hombre
de Iglesia?
— ¿Quién, señor? —replicó el caído—: mi desventura.
— Pues otra mayor os amenaza —dijo don Quijote—, si no me satisfacéis a todo
cuanto primero os pregunté.
— Con facilidad será vuestra merced satisfecho —respondió el licenciado—; y
así, sabrá vuestra merced que, aunque denantes dije que yo era licenciado,
no soy sino bachiller, y llámome Alonso López; soy natural de Alcobendas;
vengo de la ciudad de Baeza con otros once sacerdotes, que son los que
huyeron con las hachas; vamos a la ciudad de Segovia acompañando un cuerpo
muerto, que va en aquella litera, que es de un caballero que murió en
Baeza, donde fue depositado; y ahora, como digo, llevábamos sus huesos a su
sepultura, que está en Segovia, de donde es natural.
— ¿Y quién le mató? —preguntó don Quijote.
— Dios, por medio de unas calenturas pestilentes que le dieron —respondió el
bachiller.
— Desa suerte —dijo don Quijote—, quitado me ha Nuestro Señor del trabajo
que había de tomar en vengar su muerte si otro alguno le hubiera muerto;
pero, habiéndole muerto quien le mató, no hay sino callar y encoger los
hombros, porque lo mesmo hiciera si a mí mismo me matara. Y quiero que sepa
vuestra reverencia que yo soy un caballero de la Mancha, llamado don
Quijote, y es mi oficio y ejercicio andar por el mundo enderezando tuertos
y desfaciendo agravios.
— No sé cómo pueda ser eso de enderezar tuertos —dijo el bachiller—, pues a
mí de derecho me habéis vuelto tuerto, dejándome una pierna quebrada, la
cual no se verá derecha en todos los días de su vida; y el agravio que en
mí habéis deshecho ha sido dejarme agraviado de manera que me quedaré
agraviado para siempre; y harta desventura ha sido topar con vos, que vais
buscando aventuras.
— No todas las cosas —respondió don Quijote— suceden de un mismo modo. El
daño estuvo, señor bachiller Alonso López, en venir, como veníades, de
noche, vestidos con aquellas sobrepellices, con las hachas encendidas,
rezando, cubiertos de luto, que propiamente semejábades cosa mala y del
otro mundo; y así, yo no pude dejar de cumplir con mi obligación
acometiéndoos, y os acometiera aunque verdaderamente supiera que érades los
memos satanases del infierno, que por tales os juzgué y tuve siempre.
— Ya que así lo ha querido mi suerte —dijo el bachiller—, suplico a vuestra
merced, señor caballero andante (que tan mala andanza me ha dado), me ayude
a salir de debajo desta mula, que me tiene tomada una pierna entre el
estribo y la silla.
— ¡Hablara yo para mañana! —dijo don Quijote—. Y ¿hasta cuándo aguardábades
a decirme vuestro afán?
Dio luego voces a Sancho Panza que viniese; pero él no se curó de venir,
porque andaba ocupado desvalijando una acémila de repuesto que traían
aquellos buenos señores, bien bastecida de cosas de comer. Hizo Sancho
costal de su gabán, y, recogiendo todo lo que pudo y cupo en el talego,
cargó su jumento, y luego acudió a las voces de su amo y ayudó a sacar al
señor bachiller de la opresión de la mula; y, poniéndole encima della, le
dio la hacha, y don Quijote le dijo que siguiese la derrota de sus
compañeros, a quien de su parte pidiese perdón del agravio, que no había
sido en su mano dejar de haberle hecho. Díjole también Sancho:
— Si acaso quisieren saber esos señores quién ha sido el valeroso que tales
los puso, diráles vuestra merced que es el famoso don Quijote de la Mancha,
que por otro nombre se llama el Caballero de la Triste Figura.
Con esto, se fue el bachiller; y don Quijote preguntó a Sancho que qué le
había movido a llamarle el Caballero de la Triste Figura, más entonces que
nunca.
— Yo se lo diré —respondió Sancho—: porque le he estado mirando un rato a la
luz de aquella hacha que lleva aquel malandante, y verdaderamente tiene
vuestra merced la más mala figura, de poco acá, que jamás he visto; y
débelo de haber causado, o ya el cansancio deste combate, o ya la falta de
las muelas y dientes.
— No es eso —respondió don Quijote—, sino que el sabio, a cuyo cargo debe de
estar el escribir la historia de mis hazañas, le habrá parecido que será
bien que yo tome algún nombre apelativo, como lo tomaban todos los
caballeros pasados: cuál se llamaba el de la Ardiente Espada; cuál, el del
Unicornio; aquel, de las Doncellas; aquéste, el del Ave Fénix; el otro, el
Caballero del Grifo; estotro, el de la Muerte; y por estos nombres e
insignias eran conocidos por toda la redondez de la tierra. Y así, digo que
el sabio ya dicho te habrá puesto en la lengua y en el pensamiento ahora
que me llamases el Caballero de la Triste Figura, como pienso llamarme
desde hoy en adelante; y, para que mejor me cuadre tal nombre, determino de
hacer pintar, cuando haya lugar, en mi escudo una muy triste figura.
— No hay para qué gastar tiempo y dineros en hacer esa figura —dijo Sancho—,
sino lo que se ha de hacer es que vuestra merced descubra la suya y dé
rostro a los que le miraren; que, sin más ni más, y sin otra imagen ni
escudo, le llamarán el de la Triste Figura; y créame que le digo verdad,
porque le prometo a vuestra merced, señor, y esto sea dicho en burlas, que
le hace tan mala cara la hambre y la falta de las muelas, que, como ya
tengo dicho, se podrá muy bien escusar la triste pintura.
Rióse don Quijote del donaire de Sancho, pero, con todo, propuso de
llamarse de aquel nombre en pudiendo pintar su escudo, o rodela, como había
imaginado.
En esto volvió el bachiller y le dijo a don Quijote:
— Olvidábaseme de decir que advierta vuestra merced que queda descomulgado
por haber puesto las manos violentamente en cosa sagrada: juxta illud: Si
quis suadente diabolo, etc.
— No entiendo ese latín —respondió don Quijote—, mas yo sé bien que no puse
las manos, sino este lanzón; cuanto más, que yo no pensé que ofendía a
sacerdotes ni a cosas de la Iglesia, a quien respeto y adoro como católico
y fiel cristiano que soy, sino a fantasmas y a vestiglos del otro mundo; y,
cuando eso así fuese, en la memoria tengo lo que le pasó al Cid Ruy Díaz,
cuando quebró la silla del embajador de aquel rey delante de Su Santidad
del Papa, por lo cual lo descomulgó, y anduvo aquel día el buen Rodrigo de
Vivar como muy honrado y valiente caballero.
En oyendo esto el bachiller, se fue, como queda dicho, sin replicarle
palabra. Quisiera don Quijote mirar si el cuerpo que venía en la litera
eran huesos o no, pero no lo consintió Sancho, diciéndole:
— Señor, vuestra merced ha acabado esta peligrosa aventura lo más a su salvo
de todas las que yo he visto; esta gente, aunque vencida y desbaratada,
podría ser que cayese en la cuenta de que los venció sola una persona, y,
corridos y avergonzados desto, volviesen a rehacerse y a buscarnos, y nos
diesen en qué entender. El jumento está como conviene, la montaña cerca, la
hambre carga, no hay que hacer sino retirarnos con gentil compás de pies,
y, como dicen, váyase el muerto a la sepultura y el vivo a la hogaza.
Y, antecogiendo su asno, rogó a su señor que le siguiese; el cual,
pareciéndole que Sancho tenía razón, sin volverle a replicar, le siguió. Y,
a poco trecho que caminaban por entre dos montañuelas, se hallaron en un
espacioso y escondido valle, donde se apearon; y Sancho alivió el jumento,
y, tendidos sobre la verde yerba, con la salsa de su hambre, almorzaron,
comieron, merendaron y cenaron a un mesmo punto, satisfaciendo sus
estómagos con más de una fiambrera que los señores clérigos del difunto
— que pocas veces se dejan mal pasar— en la acémila de su repuesto traían.
Mas sucedióles otra desgracia, que Sancho la tuvo por la peor de todas, y
fue que no tenían vino que beber, ni aun agua que llegar a la boca; y,
acosados de la sed, dijo Sancho, viendo que el prado donde estaban estaba
colmado de verde y menuda yerba, lo que se dirá en el siguiente capítulo.
Capítulo XX. De la jamás vista ni oída aventura que con más poco peligro
fue acabada de famoso caballero en el mundo, como la que acabó el valeroso
don Quijote de la Mancha
— No es posible, señor mío, sino que estas yerbas dan testimonio de que por
aquí cerca debe de estar alguna fuente o arroyo que estas yerbas humedece;
y así, será bien que vamos un poco más adelante, que ya toparemos donde
podamos mitigar esta terrible sed que nos fatiga, que, sin duda, causa
mayor pena que la hambre.
Parecióle bien el consejo a don Quijote, y, tomando de la rienda a
Rocinante, y Sancho del cabestro a su asno, después de haber puesto sobre
él los relieves que de la cena quedaron, comenzaron a caminar por el prado
arriba a tiento, porque la escuridad de la noche no les dejaba ver cosa
alguna; mas, no hubieron andado docientos pasos, cuando llegó a sus oídos
un grande ruido de agua, como que de algunos grandes y levantados riscos se
despeñaba. Alegróles el ruido en gran manera, y, parándose a escuchar hacia
qué parte sonaba, oyeron a deshora otro estruendo que les aguó el contento
del agua, especialmente a Sancho, que naturalmente era medroso y de poco
ánimo. Digo que oyeron que daban unos golpes a compás, con un cierto crujir
de hierros y cadenas, que, acompañados del furioso estruendo del agua, que
pusieran pavor a cualquier otro corazón que no fuera el de don Quijote.
Era la noche, como se ha dicho, escura, y ellos acertaron a entrar entre
unos árboles altos, cuyas hojas, movidas del blando viento, hacían un
temeroso y manso ruido; de manera que la soledad, el sitio, la escuridad,
el ruido del agua con el susurro de las hojas, todo causaba horror y
espanto, y más cuando vieron que ni los golpes cesaban, ni el viento
dormía, ni la mañana llegaba; añadiéndose a todo esto el ignorar el lugar
donde se hallaban. Pero don Quijote, acompañado de su intrépido corazón,
saltó sobre Rocinante, y, embrazando su rodela, terció su lanzón y dijo:
— Sancho amigo, has de saber que yo nací, por querer del cielo, en esta
nuestra edad de hierro, para resucitar en ella la de oro, o la dorada, como
suele llamarse. Yo soy aquél para quien están guardados los peligros, las
grandes hazañas, los valerosos hechos. Yo soy, digo otra vez, quien ha de
resucitar los de la Tabla Redonda, los Doce de Francia y los Nueve de la
Fama, y el que ha de poner en olvido los Platires, los Tablantes, Olivantes
y Tirantes, los Febos y Belianises, con toda la caterva de los famosos
caballeros andantes del pasado tiempo, haciendo en este en que me hallo
tales grandezas, estrañezas y fechos de armas, que escurezcan las más
claras que ellos ficieron. Bien notas, escudero fiel y legal, las tinieblas
desta noche, su estraño silencio, el sordo y confuso estruendo destos
árboles, el temeroso ruido de aquella agua en cuya busca venimos, que
parece que se despeña y derrumba desde los altos montes de la luna, y
aquel incesable golpear que nos hiere y lastima los oídos; las cuales
cosas, todas juntas y cada una por sí, son bastantes a infundir miedo,
temor y espanto en el pecho del mesmo Marte, cuanto más en aquel que no
está acostumbrado a semejantes acontecimientos y aventuras. Pues todo esto
que yo te pinto son incentivos y despertadores de mi ánimo, que ya hace que
el corazón me reviente en el pecho, con el deseo que tiene de acometer esta
aventura, por más dificultosa que se muestra. Así que, aprieta un poco las
cinchas a Rocinante y quédate a Dios, y espérame aquí hasta tres días no
más, en los cuales, si no volviere, puedes tú volverte a nuestra aldea, y
desde allí, por hacerme merced y buena obra, irás al Toboso, donde dirás a
la incomparable señora mía Dulcinea que su cautivo caballero murió por
acometer cosas que le hiciesen digno de poder llamarse suyo.
Cuando Sancho oyó las palabras de su amo, comenzó a llorar con la mayor
ternura del mundo y a decille:
— Señor, yo no sé por qué quiere vuestra merced acometer esta tan temerosa
aventura: ahora es de noche, aquí no nos vee nadie, bien podemos torcer el
camino y desviarnos del peligro, aunque no bebamos en tres días; y, pues no
hay quien nos vea, menos habrá quien nos note de cobardes; cuanto más, que
yo he oído predicar al cura de nuestro lugar, que vuestra merced bien
conoce, que quien busca el peligro perece en él; así que, no es bien tentar
a Dios acometiendo tan desaforado hecho, donde no se puede escapar sino por
milagro; y basta los que ha hecho el cielo con vuestra merced en librarle
de ser manteado, como yo lo fui, y en sacarle vencedor, libre y salvo de
entre tantos enemigos como acompañaban al difunto. Y, cuando todo esto no
mueva ni ablande ese duro corazón, muévale el pensar y creer que apenas se
habrá vuestra merced apartado de aquí, cuando yo, de miedo, dé mi ánima a
quien quisiere llevarla. Yo salí de mi tierra y dejé hijos y mujer por
venir a servir a vuestra merced, creyendo valer más y no menos; pero, como
la cudicia rompe el saco, a mí me ha rasgado mis esperanzas, pues cuando
más vivas las tenía de alcanzar aquella negra y malhadada ínsula que tantas
veces vuestra merced me ha prometido, veo que, en pago y trueco della, me
quiere ahora dejar en un lugar tan apartado del trato humano. Por un solo
Dios, señor mío, que non se me faga tal desaguisado; y ya que del todo no
quiera vuestra merced desistir de acometer este fecho, dilátelo, a lo
menos, hasta la mañana; que, a lo que a mí me muestra la ciencia que
aprendí cuando era pastor, no debe de haber desde aquí al alba tres horas,
porque la boca de la Bocina está encima de la cabeza, y hace la media noche
en la línea del brazo izquierdo.
— ¿Cómo puedes tú, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, ver dónde hace esa línea, ni
dónde está esa boca o ese colodrillo que dices, si hace la noche tan escura
que no parece en todo el cielo estrella alguna?
— Así es —dijo Sancho—, pero tiene el miedo muchos ojos y vee las cosas
debajo de tierra, cuanto más encima en el cielo; puesto que, por buen
discurso, bien se puede entender que hay poco de aquí al día.
— Falte lo que faltare —respondió don Quijote—; que no se ha de decir por
mí, ahora ni en ningún tiempo, que lágrimas y ruegos me apartaron de hacer
lo que debía a estilo de caballero; y así, te ruego, Sancho, que calles;
que Dios, que me ha puesto en corazón de acometer ahora esta tan no vista y
tan temerosa aventura, tendrá cuidado de mirar por mi salud y de consolar
tu tristeza. Lo que has de hacer es apretar bien las cinchas a Rocinante y
quedarte aquí, que yo daré la vuelta presto, o vivo o muerto.
Viendo, pues, Sancho la última resolución de su amo y cuán poco valían con
él sus lágrimas, consejos y ruegos, determinó de aprovecharse de su
industria y hacerle esperar hasta el día, si pudiese; y así, cuando
apretaba las cinchas al caballo, bonitamente y sin ser sentido, ató con el
cabestro de su asno ambos pies a Rocinante, de manera que cuando don
Quijote se quiso partir, no pudo, porque el caballo no se podía mover sino
a saltos. Viendo Sancho Panza el buen suceso de su embuste, dijo:
— Ea, señor, que el cielo, conmovido de mis lágrimas y plegarias, ha
ordenado que no se pueda mover Rocinante; y si vos queréis porfiar, y
espolear, y dalle, será enojar a la fortuna y dar coces, como dicen, contra
el aguijón.
Desesperábase con esto don Quijote, y, por más que ponía las piernas al
caballo, menos le podía mover; y, sin caer en la cuenta de la ligadura,
tuvo por bien de sosegarse y esperar, o a que amaneciese, o a que Rocinante
se menease, creyendo, sin duda, que aquello venía de otra parte que de la
industria de Sancho; y así, le dijo:
— Pues así es, Sancho, que Rocinante no puede moverse, yo soy contento de
esperar a que ría el alba, aunque yo llore lo que ella tardare en venir.
— No hay que llorar —respondió Sancho—, que yo entretendré a vuestra merced
contando cuentos desde aquí al día, si ya no es que se quiere apear y
echarse a dormir un poco sobre la verde yerba, a uso de caballeros
andantes, para hallarse más descansado cuando llegue el día y punto de
acometer esta tan desemejable aventura que le espera.
— ¿A qué llamas apear o a qué dormir? —dijo don Quijote—. ¿Soy yo, por
ventura, de aquellos caballeros que toman reposo en los peligros? Duerme
tú, que naciste para dormir, o haz lo que quisieres, que yo haré lo que
viere que más viene con mi pretensión.
No se enoje vuestra merced, señor mío —respondió Sancho—, que no lo dije
por tanto.
Y, llegándose a él, puso la una mano en el arzón delantero y la otra en el
otro, de modo que quedó abrazado con el muslo izquierdo de su amo, sin
osarse apartar dél un dedo: tal era el miedo que tenía a los golpes, que
todavía alternativamente sonaban. Díjole don Quijote que contase algún
cuento para entretenerle, como se lo había prometido, a lo que Sancho dijo
que sí hiciera si le dejara el temor de lo que oía.
— Pero, con todo eso, yo me esforzaré a decir una historia que, si la
acierto a contar y no me van a la mano, es la mejor de las historias; y
estéme vuestra merced atento, que ya comienzo. «Érase que se era, el bien
que viniere para todos sea, y el mal, para quien lo fuere a buscar...» Y
advierta vuestra merced, señor mío, que el principio que los antiguos
dieron a sus consejas no fue así comoquiera, que fue una sentencia de Catón
Zonzorino, romano, que dice: "Y el mal, para quien le fuere a buscar", que
viene aquí como anillo al dedo, para que vuestra merced se esté quedo y no
vaya a buscar el mal a ninguna parte, sino que nos volvamos por otro
camino, pues nadie nos fuerza a que sigamos éste, donde tantos miedos nos
sobresaltan.
— Sigue tu cuento, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, y del camino que hemos de
seguir déjame a mí el cuidado.
— «Digo, pues —prosiguió Sancho—, que en un lugar de Estremadura había un
pastor cabrerizo (quiero decir que guardaba cabras), el cual pastor o
cabrerizo, como digo, de mi cuento, se llamaba Lope Ruiz; y este Lope Ruiz
andaba enamorado de una pastora que se llamaba Torralba, la cual pastora
llamada Torralba era hija de un ganadero rico, y este ganadero rico...»
— Si desa manera cuentas tu cuento, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, repitiendo
dos veces lo que vas diciendo, no acabarás en dos días; dilo seguidamente y
cuéntalo como hombre de entendimiento, y si no, no digas nada.
— De la misma manera que yo lo cuento —respondió Sancho—, se cuentan en mi
tierra todas las consejas, y yo no sé contarlo de otra, ni es bien que
vuestra merced me pida que haga usos nuevos.
— Di como quisieres —respondió don Quijote—; que, pues la suerte quiere que
no pueda dejar de escucharte, prosigue.
— «Así que, señor mío de mi ánima —prosiguió Sancho—, que, como ya tengo
dicho, este pastor andaba enamorado de Torralba, la pastora, que era una
moza rolliza, zahareña y tiraba algo a hombruna, porque tenía unos pocos de
bigotes, que parece que ahora la veo.»
— Luego, ¿conocístela tú? —dijo don Quijote.
— No la conocí yo —respondió Sancho—, pero quien me contó este cuento me
dijo que era tan cierto y verdadero que podía bien, cuando lo contase a
otro, afirmar y jurar que lo había visto todo. «Así que, yendo días y
viniendo días, el diablo, que no duerme y que todo lo añasca, hizo de
manera que el amor que el pastor tenía a la pastora se volviese en omecillo
y mala voluntad; y la causa fue, según malas lenguas, una cierta cantidad
de celillos que ella le dio, tales que pasaban de la raya y llegaban a lo
vedado; y fue tanto lo que el pastor la aborreció de allí adelante que, por
no verla, se quiso ausentar de aquella tierra e irse donde sus ojos no la
viesen jamás. La Torralba, que se vio desdeñada del Lope, luego le quiso
bien, mas que nunca le había querido.»
— Ésa es natural condición de mujeres —dijo don Quijote—: desdeñar a quien
las quiere y amar a quien las aborrece. Pasa adelante, Sancho.
— «Sucedió —dijo Sancho— que el pastor puso por obra su determinación, y,
antecogiendo sus cabras, se encaminó por los campos de Estremadura, para
pasarse a los reinos de Portugal. La Torralba, que lo supo, se fue tras él,
y seguíale a pie y descalza desde lejos, con un bordón en la mano y con
unas alforjas al cuello, donde llevaba, según es fama, un pedazo de espejo
y otro de un peine, y no sé qué botecillo de mudas para la cara; mas,
llevase lo que llevase, que yo no me quiero meter ahora en averiguallo,
sólo diré que dicen que el pastor llegó con su ganado a pasar el río
Guadiana, y en aquella sazón iba crecido y casi fuera de madre, y por la
parte que llegó no había barca ni barco, ni quien le pasase a él ni a su
ganado de la otra parte, de lo que se congojó mucho, porque veía que la
Torralba venía ya muy cerca y le había de dar mucha pesadumbre con sus
ruegos y lágrimas; mas, tanto anduvo mirando, que vio un pescador que tenía
junto a sí un barco, tan pequeño que solamente podían caber en él una
persona y una cabra; y, con todo esto, le habló y concertó con él que le
pasase a él y a trecientas cabras que llevaba. Entró el pescador en el
barco, y pasó una cabra; volvió, y pasó otra; tornó a volver, y tornó a
pasar otra.» Tenga vuestra merced cuenta en las cabras que el pescador va
pasando, porque si se pierde una de la memoria, se acabará el cuento y no
será posible contar más palabra dél. «Sigo, pues, y digo que el
desembarcadero de la otra parte estaba lleno de cieno y resbaloso, y
tardaba el pescador mucho tiempo en ir y volver. Con todo esto, volvió por
otra cabra, y otra, y otra...»
— Haz cuenta que las pasó todas —dijo don Quijote—: no andes yendo y
viniendo desa manera, que no acabarás de pasarlas en un año.
— ¿Cuántas han pasado hasta agora? —dijo Sancho.
— ¡Yo qué diablos sé! —respondió don Quijote—.
— He ahí lo que yo dije: que tuviese buena cuenta. Pues, por Dios, que se ha
acabado el cuento, que no hay pasar adelante.
— ¿Cómo puede ser eso? —respondió don Quijote—. ¿Tan de esencia de la
historia es saber las cabras que han pasado, por estenso, que si se yerra
una del número no puedes seguir adelante con la historia?
— No señor, en ninguna manera —respondió Sancho—; porque, así como yo
pregunté a vuestra merced que me dijese cuántas cabras habían pasado y me
respondió que no sabía, en aquel mesmo instante se me fue a mí de la
memoria cuanto me quedaba por decir, y a fe que era de mucha virtud y
contento.
— ¿De modo —dijo don Quijote— que ya la historia es acabada?
— Tan acabada es como mi madre —dijo Sancho.
— Dígote de verdad —respondió don Quijote— que tú has contado una de las más
nuevas consejas, cuento o historia, que nadie pudo pensar en el mundo; y
que tal modo de contarla ni dejarla, jamás se podrá ver ni habrá visto en
toda la vida, aunque no esperaba yo otra cosa de tu buen discurso; mas no
me maravillo, pues quizá estos golpes, que no cesan, te deben de tener
turbado el entendimiento.
— Todo puede ser —respondió Sancho—, mas yo sé que en lo de mi cuento no hay
más que decir: que allí se acaba do comienza el yerro de la cuenta del
pasaje de las cabras.
— Acabe norabuena donde quisiere —dijo don Quijote—, y veamos si se puede
mover Rocinante.
Tornóle a poner las piernas, y él tornó a dar saltos y a estarse quedo:
tanto estaba de bien atado.
En esto, parece ser, o que el frío de la mañana, que ya venía, o que Sancho
hubiese cenado algunas cosas lenitivas, o que fuese cosa natural —que es lo
que más se debe creer—, a él le vino en voluntad y deseo de hacer lo que
otro no pudiera hacer por él; mas era tanto el miedo que había entrado en
su corazón, que no osaba apartarse un negro de uña de su amo. Pues pensar
de no hacer lo que tenía gana, tampoco era posible; y así, lo que hizo, por
bien de paz, fue soltar la mano derecha, que tenía asida al arzón trasero,
con la cual, bonitamente y sin rumor alguno, se soltó la lazada corrediza
con que los calzones se sostenían, sin ayuda de otra alguna, y, en
quitándosela, dieron luego abajo y se le quedaron como grillos. Tras esto,
alzó la camisa lo mejor que pudo y echó al aire entrambas posaderas, que no
eran muy pequeñas. Hecho esto —que él pensó que era lo más que tenía que
hacer para salir de aquel terrible aprieto y angustia—, le sobrevino otra
mayor, que fue que le pareció que no podía mudarse sin hacer estrépito y
ruido, y comenzó a apretar los dientes y a encoger los hombros, recogiendo
en sí el aliento todo cuanto podía; pero, con todas estas diligencias, fue
tan desdichado que, al cabo al cabo, vino a hacer un poco de ruido, bien
diferente de aquel que a él le ponía tanto miedo. Oyólo don Quijote y dijo:
— ¿Qué rumor es ése, Sancho?
— No sé, señor —respondió él—. Alguna cosa nueva debe de ser, que las
aventuras y desventuras nunca comienzan por poco.
Tornó otra vez a probar ventura, y sucedióle tan bien que, sin más ruido ni
alboroto que el pasado, se halló libre de la carga que tanta pesadumbre le
había dado. Mas, como don Quijote tenía el sentido del olfato tan vivo como
el de los oídos, y Sancho estaba tan junto y cosido con él que casi por
línea recta subían los vapores hacia arriba, no se pudo escusar de que
algunos no llegasen a sus narices; y, apenas hubieron llegado, cuando él
fue al socorro, apretándolas entre los dos dedos; y, con tono algo gangoso,
dijo:
— Paréceme, Sancho, que tienes mucho miedo.
— Sí tengo —respondió Sancho—; mas, ¿en qué lo echa de ver vuestra merced
ahora más que nunca?
— En que ahora más que nunca hueles, y no a ámbar —respondió don Quijote.
— Bien podrá ser —dijo Sancho—, mas yo no tengo la culpa, sino vuestra
merced, que me trae a deshoras y por estos no acostumbrados pasos.
— Retírate tres o cuatro allá, amigo —dijo don Quijote (todo esto sin
quitarse los dedos de las narices)—, y desde aquí adelante ten más cuenta
con tu persona y con lo que debes a la mía; que la mucha conversación que
tengo contigo ha engendrado este menosprecio.
— Apostaré —replicó Sancho— que piensa vuestra merced que yo he hecho de mi
persona alguna cosa que no deba.
— Peor es meneallo, amigo Sancho —respondió don Quijote.
En estos coloquios y otros semejantes pasaron la noche amo y mozo. Mas,
viendo Sancho que a más andar se venía la mañana, con mucho tiento desligó
a Rocinante y se ató los calzones. Como Rocinante se vio libre, aunque él
de suyo no era nada brioso, parece que se resintió, y comenzó a dar
manotadas; porque corvetas —con perdón suyo— no las sabía hacer. Viendo,
pues, don Quijote que ya Rocinante se movía, lo tuvo a buena señal, y creyó
que lo era de que acometiese aquella temerosa aventura.
Acabó en esto de descubrirse el alba y de parecer distintamente las cosas,
y vio don Quijote que estaba entre unos árboles altos, que ellos eran
castaños, que hacen la sombra muy escura. Sintió también que el golpear no
cesaba, pero no vio quién lo podía causar; y así, sin más detenerse, hizo
sentir las espuelas a Rocinante, y, tornando a despedirse de Sancho, le
mandó que allí le aguardase tres días, a lo más largo, como ya otra vez se
lo había dicho; y que, si al cabo dellos no hubiese vuelto, tuviese por
cierto que Dios había sido servido de que en aquella peligrosa aventura se
le acabasen sus días. Tornóle a referir el recado y embajada que había de
llevar de su parte a su señora Dulcinea, y que, en lo que tocaba a la paga
de sus servicios, no tuviese pena, porque él había dejado hecho su
testamento antes que saliera de su lugar, donde se hallaría gratificado de
todo lo tocante a su salario, rata por cantidad, del tiempo que hubiese
servido; pero que si Dios le sacaba de aquel peligro sano y salvo y sin
cautela, se podía tener por muy más que cierta la prometida ínsula.
De nuevo tornó a llorar Sancho, oyendo de nuevo las lastimeras razones de
su buen señor, y determinó de no dejarle hasta el último tránsito y fin de
aquel negocio.
Destas lágrimas y determinación tan honrada de Sancho Panza saca el autor
desta historia que debía de ser bien nacido, y, por lo menos, cristiano
viejo. Cuyo sentimiento enterneció algo a su amo, pero no tanto que
mostrase flaqueza alguna; antes, disimulando lo mejor que pudo, comenzó a
caminar hacia la parte por donde le pareció que el ruido del agua y del
golpear venía.
Seguíale Sancho a pie, llevando, como tenía de costumbre, del cabestro a su
jumento, perpetuo compañero de sus prósperas y adversas fortunas; y,
habiendo andado una buena pieza por entre aquellos castaños y árboles
sombríos, dieron en un pradecillo que al pie de unas altas peñas se hacía,
de las cuales se precipitaba un grandísimo golpe de agua. Al pie de las
peñas, estaban unas casas mal hechas, que más parecían ruinas de edificios
que casas, de entre las cuales advirtieron que salía el ruido y estruendo
de aquel golpear, que aún no cesaba.
Alborotóse Rocinante con el estruendo del agua y de los golpes, y,
sosegándole don Quijote, se fue llegando poco a poco a las casas,
encomendándose de todo corazón a su señora, suplicándole que en aquella
temerosa jornada y empresa le favoreciese, y de camino se encomendaba
también a Dios, que no le olvidase. No se le quitaba Sancho del lado, el
cual alargaba cuanto podía el cuello y la vista por entre las piernas de
Rocinante, por ver si vería ya lo que tan suspenso y medroso le tenía.
Otros cien pasos serían los que anduvieron, cuando, al doblar de una punta,
pareció descubierta y patente la misma causa, sin que pudiese ser otra, de
aquel horrísono y para ellos espantable ruido, que tan suspensos y medrosos
toda la noche los había tenido. Y eran —si no lo has, ¡oh lector!, por
pesadumbre y enojo— seis mazos de batán, que con sus alternativos golpes
aquel estruendo formaban.
Cuando don Quijote vio lo que era, enmudeció y pasmóse de arriba abajo.
Miróle Sancho, y vio que tenía la cabeza inclinada sobre el pecho, con
muestras de estar corrido. Miró también don Quijote a Sancho, y viole que
tenía los carrillos hinchados y la boca llena de risa, con evidentes
señales de querer reventar con ella, y no pudo su melanconía tanto con él
que, a la vista de Sancho, pudiese dejar de reírse; y, como vio Sancho que
su amo había comenzado, soltó la presa de manera que tuvo necesidad de
apretarse las ijadas con los puños, por no reventar riendo. Cuatro veces
sosegó, y otras tantas volvió a su risa con el mismo ímpetu que primero; de
lo cual ya se daba al diablo don Quijote, y más cuando le oyó decir, como
por modo de fisga:
— «Has de saber, ¡oh Sancho amigo!, que yo nací, por querer del cielo, en
esta nuestra edad de hierro, para resucitar en ella la dorada, o de oro. Yo
soy aquél para quien están guardados los peligros, las hazañas grandes, los
valerosos fechos...»
Y por aquí fue repitiendo todas o las más razones que don Quijote dijo la
vez primera que oyeron los temerosos golpes.
Viendo, pues, don Quijote que Sancho hacía burla dél, se corrió y enojó en
tanta manera, que alzó el lanzón y le asentó dos palos, tales que, si, como
los recibió en las espaldas, los recibiera en la cabeza, quedara libre de
pagarle el salario, si no fuera a sus herederos. Viendo Sancho que sacaba
tan malas veras de sus burlas, con temor de que su amo no pasase adelante
en ellas, con mucha humildad le dijo:
— Sosiéguese vuestra merced; que, por Dios, que me burlo.
— Pues, porque os burláis, no me burlo yo —respondió don Quijote—. Venid
acá, señor alegre: ¿paréceos a vos que, si como éstos fueron mazos de
batán, fueran otra peligrosa aventura, no había yo mostrado el ánimo que
convenía para emprendella y acaballa? ¿Estoy yo obligado, a dicha, siendo,
como soy, caballero, a conocer y destinguir los sones y saber cuáles son de
batán o no? Y más, que podría ser, como es verdad, que no los he visto en
mi vida, como vos los habréis visto, como villano ruin que sois, criado y
nacido entre ellos. Si no, haced vos que estos seis mazos se vuelvan en
seis jayanes, y echádmelos a las barbas uno a uno, o todos juntos, y,
cuando yo no diere con todos patas arriba, haced de mí la burla que
quisiéredes.
— No haya más, señor mío —replicó Sancho—, que yo confieso que he andado
algo risueño en demasía. Pero dígame vuestra merced, ahora que estamos en
paz (así Dios le saque de todas las aventuras que le sucedieren tan sano y
salvo como le ha sacado désta), ¿no ha sido cosa de reír, y lo es de
contar, el gran miedo que hemos tenido? A lo menos, el que yo tuve; que de
vuestra merced ya yo sé que no le conoce, ni sabe qué es temor ni espanto.
— No niego yo —respondió don Quijote— que lo que nos ha sucedido no sea cosa
digna de risa, pero no es digna de contarse; que no son todas las personas
tan discretas que sepan poner en su punto las cosas.
— A lo menos —respondió Sancho—, supo vuestra merced poner en su punto el
lanzón, apuntándome a la cabeza, y dándome en las espaldas, gracias a Dios
y a la diligencia que puse en ladearme. Pero vaya, que todo saldrá en la
colada; que yo he oído decir: "Ése te quiere bien, que te hace llorar"; y
más, que suelen los principales señores, tras una mala palabra que dicen a
un criado, darle luego unas calzas; aunque no sé lo que le suelen dar tras
haberle dado de palos, si ya no es que los caballeros andantes dan tras
palos ínsulas o reinos en tierra firme.
— Tal podría correr el dado —dijo don Quijote— que todo lo que dices viniese
a ser verdad; y perdona lo pasado, pues eres discreto y sabes que los
primeros movimientos no son en mano del hombre, y está advertido de aquí
adelante en una cosa, para que te abstengas y reportes en el hablar
demasiado conmigo; que en cuantos libros de caballerías he leído, que son
infinitos, jamás he hallado que ningún escudero hablase tanto con su señor
como tú con el tuyo. Y en verdad que lo tengo a gran falta, tuya y mía:
tuya, en que me estimas en poco; mía, en que no me dejo estimar en más. Sí,
que Gandalín, escudero de Amadís de Gaula, conde fue de la ínsula Firme; y
se lee dél que siempre hablaba a su señor con la gorra en la mano,
inclinada la cabeza y doblado el cuerpo more turquesco. Pues, ¿qué diremos
de Gasabal, escudero de don Galaor, que fue tan callado que, para
declararnos la excelencia de su maravilloso silencio, sola una vez se
nombra su nombre en toda aquella tan grande como verdadera historia? De
todo lo que he dicho has de inferir, Sancho, que es menester hacer
diferencia de amo a mozo, de señor a criado y de caballero a escudero. Así
que, desde hoy en adelante, nos hemos de tratar con más respeto, sin darnos
cordelejo, porque, de cualquiera manera que yo me enoje con vos, ha de ser
mal para el cántaro. Las mercedes y beneficios que yo os he prometido
llegarán a su tiempo; y si no llegaren, el salario, a lo menos, no se ha de
perder, como ya os he dicho.
— Está bien cuanto vuestra merced dice —dijo Sancho—, pero querría yo saber,
por si acaso no llegase el tiempo de las mercedes y fuese necesario acudir
al de los salarios, cuánto ganaba un escudero de un caballero andante en
aquellos tiempos, y si se concertaban por meses, o por días, como peones de
albañir.
— No creo yo —respondió don Quijote— que jamás los tales escuderos
estuvieron a salario, sino a merced. Y si yo ahora te le he señalado a ti
en el testamento cerrado que dejé en mi casa, fue por lo que podía suceder;
que aún no sé cómo prueba en estos tan calamitosos tiempos nuestros la
caballería, y no querría que por pocas cosas penase mi ánima en el otro
mundo. Porque quiero que sepas, Sancho, que en él no hay estado más
peligroso que el de los aventureros.
— Así es verdad —dijo Sancho—, pues sólo el ruido de los mazos de un batán
pudo alborotar y desasosegar el corazón de un tan valeroso andante
aventurero como es vuestra merced. Mas, bien puede estar seguro que, de
aquí adelante, no despliegue mis labios para hacer donaire de las cosas de
vuestra merced, si no fuere para honrarle, como a mi amo y señor natural.
— Desa manera —replicó don Quijote—, vivirás sobre la haz de la tierra;
porque, después de a los padres, a los amos se ha de respetar como si lo
fuesen.
Capítulo XXI. Que trata de la alta aventura y rica ganancia del yelmo de
Mambrino, con otras cosas sucedidas a nuestro invencible caballero
En esto, comenzó a llover un poco, y quisiera Sancho que se entraran en el
molino de los batanes; mas habíales cobrado tal aborrecimiento don Quijote,
por la pesada burla, que en ninguna manera quiso entrar dentro; y así,
torciendo el camino a la derecha mano, dieron en otro como el que habían
llevado el día de antes.
De allí a poco, descubrió don Quijote un hombre a caballo, que traía en la
cabeza una cosa que relumbraba como si fuera de oro, y aún él apenas le
hubo visto, cuando se volvió a Sancho y le dijo:
— Paréceme, Sancho, que no hay refrán que no sea verdadero, porque todos son
sentencias sacadas de la mesma experiencia, madre de las ciencias todas,
especialmente aquel que dice: "Donde una puerta se cierra, otra se abre".
Dígolo porque si anoche nos cerró la ventura la puerta de la que
buscábamos, engañándonos con los batanes, ahora nos abre de par en par
otra, para otra mejor y más cierta aventura; que si yo no acertare a entrar
por ella, mía será la culpa, sin que la pueda dar a la poca noticia de
batanes ni a la escuridad de la noche. Digo esto porque, si no me engaño,
hacia nosotros viene uno que trae en su cabeza puesto el yelmo de Mambrino,
sobre que yo hice el juramento que sabes.
— Mire vuestra merced bien lo que dice, y mejor lo que hace —dijo Sancho—,
que no querría que fuesen otros batanes que nos acabasen de abatanar y
aporrear el sentido.
— ¡Válate el diablo por hombre! —replicó don Quijote—. ¿Qué va de yelmo a
batanes?
— No sé nada —respondió Sancho—; mas, a fe que si yo pudiera hablar tanto
como solía, que quizá diera tales razones que vuestra merced viera que se
engañaba en lo que dice.
— ¿Cómo me puedo engañar en lo que digo, traidor escrupuloso? —dijo don
Quijote—. Dime, ¿no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene, sobre un
caballo rucio rodado, que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?
— Lo que yo veo y columbro —respondió Sancho— no es sino un hombre sobre un
asno pardo, como el mío, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que relumbra.
— Pues ése es el yelmo de Mambrino —dijo don Quijote—. Apártate a una parte
y déjame con él a solas: verás cuán sin hablar palabra, por ahorrar del
tiempo, concluyo esta aventura y queda por mío el yelmo que tanto he
deseado.
— Yo me tengo en cuidado el apartarme —replicó Sancho—, mas quiera Dios,
torno a decir, que orégano sea, y no batanes.
— Ya os he dicho, hermano, que no me mentéis, ni por pienso, más eso de los
batanes —dijo don Quijote—; que voto..., y no digo más, que os batanee el
alma.
Calló Sancho, con temor que su amo no cumpliese el voto que le había
echado, redondo como una bola.
Es, pues, el caso que el yelmo, y el caballo y caballero que don Quijote
veía, era esto: que en aquel contorno había dos lugares, el uno tan pequeño
que ni tenía botica ni barbero, y el otro, que estaba junto, sí; y
así, el barbero del mayor servía al menor, en el cual tuvo necesidad un
enfermo de sangrarse y otro de hacerse la barba, para lo cual venía el
barbero, y traía una bacía de azófar; y quiso la suerte que, al tiempo que
venía, comenzó a llover, y, porque no se le manchase el sombrero, que debía
de ser nuevo, se puso la bacía sobre la cabeza; y, como estaba limpia,
desde media legua relumbraba. Venía sobre un asno pardo, como Sancho dijo,
y ésta fue la ocasión que a don Quijote le pareció caballo rucio rodado, y
caballero, y yelmo de oro; que todas las cosas que veía, con mucha
facilidad las acomodaba a sus desvariadas caballerías y malandantes
pensamientos. Y cuando él vio que el pobre caballero llegaba cerca, sin
ponerse con él en razones, a todo correr de Rocinante le enristró con el
lanzón bajo, llevando intención de pasarle de parte a parte; mas cuando a
él llegaba, sin detener la furia de su carrera, le dijo:
— ¡Defiéndete, cautiva criatura, o entriégame de tu voluntad lo que con
tanta razón se me debe!
El barbero, que, tan sin pensarlo ni temerlo, vio venir aquella fantasma
sobre sí, no tuvo otro remedio, para poder guardarse del golpe de la lanza,
si no fue el dejarse caer del asno abajo; y no hubo tocado al suelo, cuando
se levantó más ligero que un gamo y comenzó a correr por aquel llano, que
no le alcanzara el viento. Dejóse la bacía en el suelo, con la cual se
contentó don Quijote, y dijo que el pagano había andado discreto y que
había imitado al castor, el cual, viéndose acosado de los cazadores, se
taraza y arpa con los dientes aquéllo por lo que él, por distinto natural,
sabe que es perseguido. Mandó a Sancho que alzase el yelmo, el cual,
tomándola en las manos, dijo:
— Por Dios, que la bacía es buena y que vale un real de a ocho como un
maravedí.
Y, dándosela a su amo, se la puso luego en la cabeza, rodeándola a una
parte y a otra, buscándole el encaje; y, como no se le hallaba, dijo:
— Sin duda que el pagano, a cuya medida se forjó primero esta famosa celada,
debía de tener grandísima cabeza, y lo peor dello es que le falta la mitad.
Cuando Sancho oyó llamar a la bacía celada, no pudo tener la risa; mas
vínosele a las mientes la cólera de su amo, y calló en la mitad della.
— ¿De qué te ríes, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote.
— Ríome —respondió él— de considerar la gran cabeza que tenía el pagano
dueño deste almete, que no semeja sino una bacía de barbero pintiparada.
— ¿Sabes qué imagino, Sancho? Que esta famosa pieza deste encantado yelmo,
por algún estraño acidente, debió de venir a manos de quien no supo conocer
ni estimar su valor, y, sin saber lo que hacía, viéndola de oro purísimo,
debió de fundir la otra mitad para aprovecharse del precio, y de la otra
mitad hizo ésta, que parece bacía de barbero, como tú dices. Pero, sea lo
que fuere; que para mí que la conozco no hace al caso su trasmutación; que
yo la aderezaré en el primer lugar donde haya herrero, y de suerte que no
le haga ventaja, ni aun le llegue, la que hizo y forjó el dios de las
herrerías para el dios de las batallas; y, en este entretanto, la traeré
como pudiere, que más vale algo que no nada; cuanto más, que bien será
bastante para defenderme de alguna pedrada.
— Eso será —dijo Sancho— si no se tira con honda, como se tiraron en la
pelea de los dos ejércitos, cuando le santiguaron a vuestra merced las
muelas y le rompieron el alcuza donde venía aquel benditísimo brebaje que
me hizo vomitar las asaduras.along
— No me da mucha pena el haberle perdido, que ya sabes tú, Sancho —dijo don
Quijote—, que yo tengo la receta en la memoria.
— También la tengo yo —respondió Sancho—, pero si yo le hiciere ni le
probare más en mi vida, aquí sea mi hora. Cuanto más, que no pienso ponerme
en ocasión de haberle menester, porque pienso guardarme con todos mis cinco
sentidos de ser ferido ni de ferir a nadie. De lo del ser otra vez
manteado, no digo nada, que semejantes desgracias mal se pueden prevenir, y
si vienen, no hay que hacer otra cosa sino encoger los hombros, detener el
aliento, cerrar los ojos y dejarse ir por donde la suerte y la manta nos
llevare.
— Mal cristiano eres, Sancho —dijo, oyendo esto, don Quijote—, porque nunca
olvidas la injuria que una vez te han hecho; pues sábete que es de pechos
nobles y generosos no hacer caso de niñerías. ¿Qué pie sacaste cojo, qué
costilla quebrada, qué cabeza rota, para que no se te olvide aquella burla?
Que, bien apurada la cosa, burla fue y pasatiempo; que, a no entenderlo yo
ansí, ya yo hubiera vuelto allá y hubiera hecho en tu venganza más daño que
el que hicieron los griegos por la robada Elena. La cual, si fuera en este
tiempo, o mi Dulcinea fuera en aquél, pudiera estar segura que no tuviera
tanta fama de hermosa como tiene.
Y aquí dio un sospiro, y le puso en las nubes. Y dijo Sancho:
— Pase por burlas, pues la venganza no puede pasar en veras; pero yo sé de
qué calidad fueron las veras y las burlas, y sé también que no se me caerán
de la memoria, como nunca se quitarán de las espaldas. Pero, dejando esto
aparte, dígame vuestra merced qué haremos deste caballo rucio rodado, que
parece asno pardo, que dejó aquí desamparado aquel Martino que vuestra
merced derribó; que, según él puso los pies en polvorosa y cogió las de
Villadiego, no lleva pergenio de volver por él jamás; y ¡para mis barbas,
si no es bueno el rucio!
— Nunca yo acostumbro —dijo don Quijote— despojar a los que venzo, ni es uso
de caballería quitarles los caballos y dejarlos a pie, si ya no fuese que
el vencedor hubiese perdido en la pendencia el suyo; que, en tal caso,
lícito es tomar el del vencido, como ganado en guerra lícita. Así que,
Sancho, deja ese caballo, o asno, o lo que tú quisieres que sea, que, como
su dueño nos vea alongados de aquí, volverá por él.
— Dios sabe si quisiera llevarle —replicó Sancho—, o, por lo menos, trocalle
con este mío, que no me parece tan bueno. Verdaderamente que son estrechas
las leyes de caballería, pues no se estienden a dejar trocar un asno por
otro; y querría saber si podría trocar los aparejos siquiera.
— En eso no estoy muy cierto —respondió don Quijote—; y, en caso de duda,
hasta estar mejor informado, digo que los trueques, si es que tienes dellos
necesidad estrema.
— Tan estrema es —respondió Sancho— que si fueran para mi misma persona, no
los hubiera menester más.
Y luego, habilitado con aquella licencia, hizo mutatio caparum y puso su
jumento a las mil lindezas, dejándole mejorado en tercio y quinto.
Hecho esto, almorzaron de las sobras del real que del acémila despojaron,
bebieron del agua del arroyo de los batanes, sin volver la cara a mirallos:
tal era el aborrecimiento que les tenían por el miedo en que les habían
puesto.
Cortada, pues, la cólera, y aun la malenconía, subieron a caballo, y, sin
tomar determinado camino, por ser muy de caballeros andantes el no tomar
ninguno cierto, se pusieron a caminar por donde la voluntad de Rocinante
quiso, que se llevaba tras sí la de su amo, y aun la del asno, que siempre
le seguía por dondequiera que guiaba, en buen amor y compañía. Con todo
esto, volvieron al camino real y siguieron por él a la ventura, sin otro
disignio alguno.
Yendo, pues, así caminando, dijo Sancho a su amo:
— Señor, ¿quiere vuestra merced darme licencia que departa un poco con él?
Que, después que me puso aquel áspero mandamiento del silencio, se me han
podrido más de cuatro cosas en el estómago, y una sola que ahora tengo en
el pico de la lengua no querría que se mal lograse.
— Dila —dijo don Quijote—, y sé breve en tus razonamientos, que ninguno hay
gustoso si es largo.
— Digo, pues, señor —respondió Sancho—, que, de algunos días a esta parte,
he considerado cuán poco se gana y granjea de andar buscando estas
aventuras que vuestra merced busca por estos desiertos y encrucijadas de
caminos, donde, ya que se venzan y acaben las más eligrosas, no hay quien
las vea ni sepa; y así, se han de quedar en perpetuo silencio, y en
perjuicio de la intención de vuestra merced y de lo que ellas merecen. Y
así, me parece que sería mejor, salvo el mejor parecer de vuestra merced,
que nos fuésemos a servir a algún emperador, o a otro príncipe grande que
tenga alguna guerra, en cuyo servicio vuestra merced muestre el valor de su
persona, sus grandes fuerzas y mayor entendimiento; que, visto esto del
señor a quien sirviéremos, por fuerza nos ha de remunerar, a cada cual
según sus méritos, y allí no faltará quien ponga en escrito las hazañas de
vuestra merced, para perpetua memoria. De las mías no digo nada, pues no
han de salir de los límites escuderiles; aunque sé decir que, si se usa en
la caballería escribir hazañas de escuderos, que no pienso que se han de
quedar las mías entre renglones.
— No dices mal, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—; mas, antes que se llegue a
ese término, es menester andar por el mundo, como en aprobación, buscando
las aventuras, para que, acabando algunas, se cobre nombre y fama tal que,
cuando se fuere a la corte de algún gran monarca, ya sea el caballero
conocido por sus obras; y que, apenas le hayan visto entrar los muchachos
por la puerta de la ciudad, cuando todos le sigan y rodeen, dando voces,
diciendo: ''Éste es el Caballero del Sol'', o de la Sierpe, o de otra
insignia alguna, debajo de la cual hubiere acabado grandes hazañas. ''Éste
es —dirán— el que venció en singular batalla al gigantazo Brocabruno de la
Gran Fuerza; el que desencantó al Gran Mameluco de Persia del largo
encantamento en que había estado casi novecientos años''. Así que, de mano
en mano, irán pregonando tus hechos, y luego, al alboroto de los muchachos
y de la demás gente, se parará a las fenestras de su real palacio el rey de
aquel reino, y así como vea al caballero, conociéndole por las armas o por
la empresa del escudo, forzosamente ha de decir: ''¡Ea, sus! ¡Salgan mis
caballeros, cuantos en mi corte están, a recebir a la flor de la
caballería, que allí viene!'' A cuyo mandamiento saldrán todos, y él
llegará hasta la mitad de la escalera, y le abrazará estrechísimamente, y
le dará paz besándole en el rostro; y luego le llevará por la mano al
aposento de la señora reina, adonde el caballero la hallará con la infanta,
su hija, que ha de ser una de las más fermosas y acabadas doncellas que, en
gran parte de lo descubierto de la tierra, a duras penas se pueda hallar.
Sucederá tras esto, luego en continente, que ella ponga los ojos en el
caballero y él en los della, y cada uno parezca a otro cosa más divina que
humana; y, sin saber cómo ni cómo no, han de quedar presos y enlazados en
la intricable red amorosa, y con gran cuita en sus corazones por no saber
cómo se han de fablar para descubrir sus ansias y sentimientos. Desde allí
le llevarán, sin duda, a algún cuarto del palacio, ricamente aderezado,
donde, habiéndole quitado las armas, le traerán un rico manto de escarlata
con que se cubra; y si bien pareció armado, tan bien y mejor ha de parecer
en farseto. Venida la noche, cenará con el rey, reina e infanta, donde
nunca quitará los ojos della, mirándola a furto de los circustantes, y ella
hará lo mesmo con la mesma sagacidad, porque, como tengo dicho, es muy
discreta doncella. Levantarse han las tablas, y entrará a deshora por la
puerta de la sala un feo y pequeño enano con una fermosa dueña, que, entre
dos gigantes, detrás del enano viene, con cierta aventura, hecha por un
antiquísimo sabio, que el que la acabare será tenido por el mejor caballero
del mundo. Mandará luego el rey que todos los que están presentes la
prueben, y ninguno le dará fin y cima sino el caballero huésped, en mucho
pro de su fama, de lo cual quedará contentísima la infanta, y se tendrá por
contenta y pagada además, por haber puesto y colocado sus pensamientos en
tan alta parte. Y lo bueno es que este rey, o príncipe, o lo que es, tiene
una muy reñida guerra con otro tan poderoso como él, y el caballero huésped
le pide (al cabo de algunos días que ha estado en su corte) licencia para
ir a servirle en aquella guerra dicha. Darásela el rey de muy buen talante,
y el caballero le besará cortésmente las manos por la merced que le face. Y
aquella noche se despedirá de su señora la infanta por las rejas de un
jardín, que cae en el aposento donde ella duerme, por las cuales ya otras
muchas veces la había fablado, siendo medianera y sabidora de todo una
doncella de quien la infanta mucho se fiaba. Sospirará él, desmayaráse
ella, traerá agua la doncella, acuitaráse mucho porque viene la mañana, y
no querría que fuesen descubiertos, por la honra de su señora. Finalmente,
la infanta volverá en sí y dará sus blancas manos por la reja al caballero,
el cual se las besará mil y mil veces y se las bañará en lágrimas. Quedará
concertado entre los dos del modo que se han de hacer saber sus buenos o
malos sucesos, y rogarále la princesa que se detenga lo menos que pudiere;
prometérselo ha él con muchos juramentos; tórnale a besar las manos, y
despídese con tanto sentimiento que estará poco por acabar la vida. Vase
desde allí a su aposento, échase sobre su lecho, no puede dormir del dolor
de la partida, madruga muy de mañana, vase a despedir del rey y de la reina
y de la infanta; dícenle, habiéndose despedido de los dos, que la señora
infanta está mal dispuesta y que no puede recebir visita; piensa el
caballero que es de pena de su partida, traspásasele el corazón, y falta
poco de no dar indicio manifiesto de su pena. Está la doncella medianera
delante, halo de notar todo, váselo a decir a su señora, la cual la recibe
con lágrimas y le dice que una de las mayores penas que tiene es no saber
quién sea su caballero, y si es de linaje de reyes o no; asegúrala la
doncella que no puede caber tanta cortesía, gentileza y valentía como la de
su caballero sino en subjeto real y grave; consuélase con esto la cuitada;
procura consolarse, por no dar mal indicio de sí a sus padres, y, a cabo de
dos días, sale en público. Ya se es ido el caballero: pelea en la guerra,
vence al enemigo del rey, gana muchas ciudades, triunfa de muchas batallas,
vuelve a la corte, ve a su señora por donde suele, conciértase que la pida
a su padre por mujer en pago de sus servicios. No se la quiere dar el rey,
porque no sabe quién es; pero, con todo esto, o robada o de otra cualquier
suerte que sea, la infanta viene a ser su esposa y su padre lo viene a
tener a gran ventura, porque se vino a averiguar que el tal caballero es
hijo de un valeroso rey de no sé qué reino, porque creo que no debe de
estar en el mapa. Muérese el padre, hereda la infanta, queda rey el
caballero en dos palabras. Aquí entra luego el hacer mercedes a su escudero
y a todos aquellos que le ayudaron a subir a tan alto estado: casa a su
escudero con una doncella de la infanta, que será, sin duda, la que fue
tercera en sus amores, que es hija de un duque muy principal.
— Eso pido, y barras derechas —dijo Sancho—; a eso me atengo, porque todo,
al pie de la letra, ha de suceder por vuestra merced, llamándose el
Caballero de la Triste Figura.
— No lo dudes, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—, porque del mesmo y por los
mesmos pasos que esto he contado suben y han subido los caballeros andantes
a ser reyes y emperadores. Sólo falta agora mirar qué rey de los cristianos
o de los paganos tenga guerra y tenga hija hermosa; pero tiempo habrá para
pensar esto, pues, como te tengo dicho, primero se ha de cobrar fama por
otras partes que se acuda a la corte. También me falta otra cosa; que,
puesto caso que se halle rey con guerra y con hija hermosa, y que yo haya
cobrado fama increíble por todo el universo, no sé yo cómo se podía hallar
que yo sea de linaje de reyes, o, por lo menos, primo segundo de emperador;
porque no me querrá el rey dar a su hija por mujer si no está primero muy
enterado en esto, aunque más lo merezcan mis famosos hechos. Así que, por
esta falta, temo perder lo que mi brazo tiene bien merecido. Bien es verdad
que yo soy hijodalgo de solar conocido, de posesión y propriedad y de
devengar quinientos sueldos; y podría ser que el sabio que escribiese mi
historia deslindase de tal manera mi parentela y decendencia, que me
hallase quinto o sesto nieto de rey. Porque te hago saber, Sancho, que hay
dos maneras de linajes en el mundo: unos que traen y derriban su
decendencia de príncipes y monarcas, a quien poco a poco el tiempo ha
deshecho, y han acabado en punta, como pirámide puesta al revés; otros
tuvieron principio de gente baja, y van subiendo de grado en grado, hasta
llegar a ser grandes señores. De manera que está la diferencia en que unos
fueron, que ya no son, y otros son, que ya no fueron; y podría ser yo
déstos que, después de averiguado, hubiese sido mi principio grande y
famoso, con lo cual se debía de contentar el rey, mi suegro, que hubiere de
ser. Y cuando no, la infanta me ha de querer de manera que, a pesar de su
padre, aunque claramente sepa que soy hijo de un azacán, me ha de admitir
por señor y por esposo; y si no, aquí entra el roballa y llevalla donde más
gusto me diere; que el tiempo o la muerte ha de acabar el enojo de sus
padres.
— Ahí entra bien también —dijo Sancho— lo que algunos desalmados dicen: "No
pidas de grado lo que puedes tomar por fuerza"; aunque mejor cuadra decir:
"Más vale salto de mata que ruego de hombres buenos". Dígolo porque si el
señor rey, suegro de vuestra merced, no se quisiere domeñar a entregalle a
mi señora la infanta, no hay sino, como vuestra merced dice, roballa y
trasponella. Pero está el daño que, en tanto que se hagan las paces y se
goce pacíficamente el reino, el pobre escudero se podrá estar a diente en
esto de las mercedes. Si ya no es que la doncella tercera, que ha de ser su
mujer, se sale con la infanta, y él pasa con ella su mala ventura, hasta
que el cielo ordene otra cosa; porque bien podrá, creo yo, desde luego
dársela su señor por ligítima esposa.
— Eso no hay quien la quite —dijo don Quijote.
— Pues, como eso sea —respondió Sancho—, no hay sino encomendarnos a Dios, y
dejar correr la suerte por donde mejor lo encaminare.
— Hágalo Dios —respondió don Quijote— como yo deseo y tú, Sancho, has
menester; y ruin sea quien por ruin se tiene.
— Sea par Dios —dijo Sancho—, que yo cristiano viejo soy, y para ser conde
esto me basta.
— Y aun te sobra —dijo don Quijote—; y cuando no lo fueras, no hacía nada al
caso, porque, siendo yo el rey, bien te puedo dar nobleza, sin que la
compres ni me sirvas con nada. Porque, en haciéndote conde, cátate ahí
caballero, y digan lo que dijeren; que a buena fe que te han de llamar
señoría, mal que les pese.
— Y ¡montas que no sabría yo autorizar el litado! —dijo Sancho.
— Dictado has de decir, que no litado —dijo su amo.
— Sea ansí —respondió Sancho Panza—. Digo que le sabría bien acomodar,
porque, por vida mía, que un tiempo fui muñidor de una cofradía, y que me
asentaba tan bien la ropa de muñidor, que decían todos que tenía presencia
para poder ser prioste de la mesma cofradía. Pues, ¿qué será cuando me
ponga un ropón ducal a cuestas, o me vista de oro y de perlas, a uso de
conde estranjero? Para mí tengo que me han de venir a ver de cien leguas.
— Bien parecerás —dijo don Quijote—, pero será menester que te rapes las
barbas a menudo; que, según las tienes de espesas, aborrascadas y mal
puestas, si no te las rapas a navaja, cada dos días por lo menos, a tiro de
escopeta se echará de ver lo que eres.
— ¿Qué hay más —dijo Sancho—, sino tomar un barbero y tenelle asalariado en
casa? Y aun, si fuere menester, le haré que ande tras mí, como caballerizo
de grande.
— Pues, ¿cómo sabes tú —preguntó don Quijote— que los grandes llevan detrás
de sí a sus caballerizos?
— Yo se lo diré —respondió Sancho—: los años pasados estuve un mes en la
corte, y allí vi que, paseándose un señor muy pequeño, que decían que era
muy grande, un hombre le seguía a caballo a todas las vueltas que daba, que
no parecía sino que era su rabo. Pregunté que cómo aquel hombre no se
juntaba con el otro, sino que siempre andaba tras dél. Respondiéronme que
era su caballerizo y que era uso de los grandes llevar tras sí a los tales.
Desde entonces lo sé tan bien que nunca se me ha olvidado.
— Digo que tienes razón —dijo don Quijote—, y que así puedes tú llevar a tu
barbero; que los usos no vinieron todos juntos, ni se inventaron a una, y
puedes ser tú el primero conde que lleve tras sí su barbero; y aun es de
más confianza el hacer la barba que ensillar un caballo.
— Quédese eso del barbero a mi cargo —dijo Sancho—, y al de vuestra merced
se quede el procurar venir a ser rey y el hacerme conde.
— Así será —respondió don Quijote.
Y, alzando los ojos, vio lo que se dirá en el siguiente capítulo.
Capítulo XXII. De la libertad que dio don Quijote a muchos desdichados que,
mal de su grado, los llevaban donde no quisieran ir
Cuenta Cide Hamete Benengeli, autor arábigo y manchego, en esta gravísima,
altisonante, mínima, dulce e imaginada historia que, después que entre el
famoso don Quijote de la Mancha y Sancho Panza, su escudero, pasaron
aquellas razones que en el fin del capítulo veinte y uno quedan referidas,
que don Quijote alzó los ojos y vio que por el camino que llevaba venían
hasta doce hombres a pie, ensartados, como cuentas, en una gran cadena de
hierro por los cuellos, y todos con esposas a las manos. Venían ansimismo
con ellos dos hombres de a caballo y dos de a pie; los de a caballo, con
escopetas de rueda, y los de a pie, con dardos y espadas; y que así como
Sancho Panza los vido, dijo:
— Ésta es cadena de galeotes, gente forzada del rey, que va a las galeras.
— ¿Cómo gente forzada? —preguntó don Quijote—. ¿Es posible que el rey haga
fuerza a ninguna gente?
— No digo eso —respondió Sancho—, sino que es gente que, por sus delitos, va
condenada a servir al rey en las galeras de por fuerza.
— En resolución —replicó don Quijote—, comoquiera que ello sea, esta gente,
aunque los llevan, van de por fuerza, y no de su voluntad.
— Así es —dijo Sancho.
— Pues desa manera —dijo su amo—, aquí encaja la ejecución de mi oficio:
desfacer fuerzas y socorrer y acudir a los miserables.
— Advierta vuestra merced —dijo Sancho— que la justicia, que es el mesmo
rey, no hace fuerza ni agravio a semejante gente, sino que los castiga en
pena de sus delitos.
Llegó, en esto, la cadena de los galeotes, y don Quijote, con muy corteses
razones, pidió a los que iban en su guarda fuesen servidos de informalle y
decille la causa, o causas, por que llevan aquella gente de aquella manera.
Una de las guardas de a caballo respondió que eran galeotes, gente de Su
Majestad que iba a galeras, y que no había más que decir, ni él tenía más
que saber.
— Con todo eso —replicó don Quijote—, querría saber de cada uno dellos en
particular la causa de su desgracia.
Añadió a éstas otras tales y tan comedidas razones, para moverlos a que
dijesen lo que deseaba, que la otra guarda de a caballo le dijo:
— Aunque llevamos aquí el registro y la fe de las sentencias de cada uno
destos malaventurados, no es tiempo éste de detenerles a sacarlas ni a
leellas; vuestra merced llegue y se lo pregunte a ellos mesmos, que ellos
lo dirán si quisieren, que sí querrán, porque es gente que recibe gusto de
hacer y decir bellaquerías.
Con esta licencia, que don Quijote se tomara aunque no se la dieran, se
llegó a la cadena, y al primero le preguntó que por qué pecados iba de tan
mala guisa. Él le respondió que por enamorado iba de aquella manera.
— ¿Por eso no más? —replicó don Quijote—. Pues, si por enamorados echan a
galeras, días ha que pudiera yo estar bogando en ellas.
— No son los amores como los que vuestra merced piensa —dijo el galeote—;
que los míos fueron que quise tanto a una canasta de colar, atestada de
ropa blanca, que la abracé conmigo tan fuertemente que, a no quitármela la
justicia por fuerza, aún hasta agora no la hubiera dejado de mi voluntad.
Fue en fragante, no hubo lugar de tormento; concluyóse la causa,
acomodáronme las espaldas con ciento, y por añadidura tres precisos de
gurapas, y acabóse la obra.
— ¿Qué son gurapas? —preguntó don Quijote.
— Gurapas son galeras —respondió el galeote.
El cual era un mozo de hasta edad de veinte y cuatro años, y dijo que era
natural de Piedrahíta. Lo mesmo preguntó don Quijote al segundo, el cual no
respondió palabra, según iba de triste y malencónico; mas respondió por él
el primero, y dijo:
— Éste, señor, va por canario; digo, por músico y cantor.
— Pues, ¿cómo —repitió don Quijote—, por músicos y cantores van también a
galeras?
— Sí, señor —respondió el galeote—, que no hay peor cosa que cantar en el
ansia.
— Antes, he yo oído decir —dijo don Quijote— que quien canta sus males
espanta.
— Acá es al revés —dijo el galeote—, que quien canta una vez llora toda la
vida.
— No lo entiendo —dijo don Quijote.
Mas una de las guardas le dijo:
— Señor caballero, cantar en el ansia se dice, entre esta gente non santa,
confesar en el tormento. A este pecador le dieron tormento y confesó su
delito, que era ser cuatrero, que es ser ladrón de bestias, y, por haber
confesado, le condenaron por seis años a galeras, amén de docientos azotes
que ya lleva en las espaldas. Y va siempre pensativo y triste, porque los
demás ladrones que allá quedan y aquí van le maltratan y aniquilan, y
escarnecen y tienen en poco, porque confesó y no tuvo ánimo de decir nones.
Porque dicen ellos que tantas letras tiene un no como un sí, y que harta
ventura tiene un delincuente, que está en su lengua su vida o su muerte, y
no en la de los testigos y probanzas; y para mí tengo que no van muy fuera
de camino.
— Y yo lo entiendo así —respondió don Quijote.
El cual, pasando al tercero, preguntó lo que a los otros; el cual, de
presto y con mucho desenfado, respondió y dijo:
— Yo voy por cinco años a las señoras gurapas por faltarme diez ducados.
— Yo daré veinte de muy buena gana —dijo don Quijote— por libraros desa
pesadumbre.
— Eso me parece —respondió el galeote— como quien tiene dineros en mitad del
golfo y se está muriendo de hambre, sin tener adonde comprar lo que ha
menester. Dígolo porque si a su tiempo tuviera yo esos veinte ducados que
vuestra merced ahora me ofrece, hubiera untado con ellos la péndola del
escribano y avivado el ingenio del procurador, de manera que hoy me viera
en mitad de la plaza de Zocodover, de Toledo, y no en este camino,
atraillado como galgo; pero Dios es grande: paciencia y basta.
Pasó don Quijote al cuarto, que era un hombre de venerable rostro con una
barba blanca que le pasaba del pecho; el cual, oyéndose preguntar la causa
por que allí venía, comenzó a llorar y no respondió palabra; mas el quinto
condenado le sirvió de lengua, y dijo:
— Este hombre honrado va por cuatro años a galeras, habiendo paseado las
acostumbradas vestido en pompa y a caballo.
— Eso es —dijo Sancho Panza—, a lo que a mí me parece, haber salido a la
vergüenza.
— Así es —replicó el galeote—; y la culpa por que le dieron esta pena es por
haber sido corredor de oreja, y aun de todo el cuerpo. En efecto, quiero
decir que este caballero va por alcahuete, y por tener asimesmo sus puntas
y collar de hechicero.
— A no haberle añadido esas puntas y collar —dijo don Quijote—, por
solamente el alcahuete limpio, no merecía él ir a bogar en las galeras,
sino a mandallas y a ser general dellas; porque no es así comoquiera el
oficio de alcahuete, que es oficio de discretos y necesarísimo en la
república bien ordenada, y que no le debía ejercer sino gente muy bien
nacida; y aun había de haber veedor y examinador de los tales, como le hay
de los demás oficios, con número deputado y conocido, como corredores de
lonja; y desta manera se escusarían muchos males que se causan por andar
este oficio y ejercicio entre gente idiota y de poco entendimiento, como
son mujercillas de poco más a menos, pajecillos y truhanes de pocos años y
de poca experiencia, que, a la más necesaria ocasión y cuando es menester
dar una traza que importe, se les yelan las migas entre la boca y la mano y
no saben cuál es su mano derecha. Quisiera pasar adelante y dar las razones
por que convenía hacer elección de los que en la república habían de tener
tan necesario oficio, pero no es el lugar acomodado para ello: algún día lo
diré a quien lo pueda proveer y remediar. Sólo digo ahora que la pena que
me ha causado ver estas blancas canas y este rostro venerable en tanta
fatiga, por alcahuete, me la ha quitado el adjunto de ser hechicero; aunque
bien sé que no hay hechizos en el mundo que puedan mover y forzar la
voluntad, como algunos simples piensan; que es libre nuestro albedrío, y no
hay yerba ni encanto que le fuerce. Lo que suelen hacer algunas mujercillas
simples y algunos embusteros bellacos es algunas misturas y venenos con que
vuelven locos a los hombres, dando a entender que tienen fuerza para hacer
querer bien, siendo, como digo, cosa imposible forzar la voluntad.
— Así es —dijo el buen viejo—, y, en verdad, señor, que en lo de hechicero
que no tuve culpa; en lo de alcahuete, no lo pude negar. Pero nunca pensé
que hacía mal en ello: que toda mi intención era que todo el mundo se
holgase y viviese en paz y quietud, sin pendencias ni penas; pero no me
aprovechó nada este buen deseo para dejar de ir adonde no espero volver,
según me cargan los años y un mal de orina que llevo, que no me deja
reposar un rato.
Y aquí tornó a su llanto, como de primero; y túvole Sancho tanta compasión,
que sacó un real de a cuatro del seno y se le dio de limosna.
Pasó adelante don Quijote, y preguntó a otro su delito, el cual respondió
con no menos, sino con mucha más gallardía que el pasado:
— Yo voy aquí porque me burlé demasiadamente con dos primas hermanas mías, y
con otras dos hermanas que no lo eran mías; finalmente, tanto me burlé con
todas, que resultó de la burla crecer la parentela, tan intricadamente que
no hay diablo que la declare. Probóseme todo, faltó favor, no tuve dineros,
víame a pique de perder los tragaderos, sentenciáronme a galeras por seis
años, consentí: castigo es de mi culpa; mozo soy: dure la vida, que con
ella todo se alcanza. Si vuestra merced, señor caballero, lleva alguna cosa
con que socorrer a estos pobretes, Dios se lo pagará en el cielo, y
nosotros tendremos en la tierra cuidado de rogar a Dios en nuestras
oraciones por la vida y salud de vuestra merced, que sea tan larga y tan
buena como su buena presencia merece.
Éste iba en hábito de estudiante, y dijo una de las guardas que era muy
grande hablador y muy gentil latino.
Tras todos éstos, venía un hombre de muy buen parecer, de edad de treinta
años, sino que al mirar metía el un ojo en el otro un poco. Venía
diferentemente atado que los demás, porque traía una cadena al pie, tan
grande que se la liaba por todo el cuerpo, y dos argollas a la garganta, la
una en la cadena, y la otra de las que llaman guardaamigo o piedeamigo, de
la cual decendían dos hierros que llegaban a la cintura, en los cuales se
asían dos esposas, donde llevaba las manos, cerradas con un grueso candado,
de manera que ni con las manos podía llegar a la boca, ni podía bajar la
cabeza a llegar a las manos. Preguntó don Quijote que cómo iba aquel hombre
con tantas prisiones más que los otros. Respondióle la guarda porque tenía
aquel solo más delitos que todos los otros juntos, y que era tan atrevido y
tan grande bellaco que, aunque le llevaban de aquella manera, no iban
seguros dél, sino que temían que se les había de huir.
— ¿Qué delitos puede tener —dijo don Quijote—, si no han merecido más pena
que echalle a las galeras?
— Va por diez años —replicó la guarda—, que es como muerte cevil. No se
quiera saber más, sino que este buen hombre es el famoso Ginés de
Pasamonte, que por otro nombre llaman Ginesillo de Parapilla.
— Señor comisario —dijo entonces el galeote—, váyase poco a poco, y no
andemos ahora a deslindar nombres y sobrenombres. Ginés me llamo y no
Ginesillo, y Pasamonte es mi alcurnia, y no Parapilla, como voacé dice; y
cada uno se dé una vuelta a la redonda, y no hará poco.
— Hable con menos tono —replicó el comisario—, señor ladrón de más de la
marca, si no quiere que le haga callar, mal que le pese.
— Bien parece —respondió el galeote— que va el hombre como Dios es servido,
pero algún día sabrá alguno si me llamo Ginesillo de Parapilla o no.
— Pues, ¿no te llaman ansí, embustero? —dijo la guarda.
— Sí llaman —respondió Ginés—, mas yo haré que no me lo llamen, o me las
pelaría donde yo digo entre mis dientes. Señor caballero, si tiene algo que
darnos, dénoslo ya, y vaya con Dios, que ya enfada con tanto querer saber
vidas ajenas; y si la mía quiere saber, sepa que yo soy Ginés de Pasamonte,
cuya vida está escrita por estos pulgares.
— Dice verdad —dijo el comisario—: que él mesmo ha escrito su historia, que
no hay más, y deja empeñado el libro en la cárcel en docientos reales.
— Y le pienso quitar —dijo Ginés—, si quedara en docientos ducados.
— ¿Tan bueno es? —dijo don Quijote.
— Es tan bueno —respondió Ginés— que mal año para Lazarillo de Tormes y para
todos cuantos de aquel género se han escrito o escribieren. Lo que le sé
decir a voacé es que trata verdades, y que son verdades tan lindas y tan
donosas que no pueden haber mentiras que se le igualen.
— ¿Y cómo se intitula el libro? —preguntó don Quijote.
— La vida de Ginés de Pasamonte —respondió el mismo.
— ¿Y está acabado? —preguntó don Quijote.
— ¿Cómo puede estar acabado —respondió él—, si aún no está acabada mi vida?
Lo que está escrito es desde mi nacimiento hasta el punto que esta última
vez me han echado en galeras.
— Luego, ¿otra vez habéis estado en ellas? —dijo don Quijote.
— Para servir a Dios y al rey, otra vez he estado cuatro años, y ya sé a qué
sabe el bizcocho y el corbacho —respondió Ginés—; y no me pesa mucho de ir
a ellas, porque allí tendré lugar de acabar mi libro, que me quedan muchas
cosas que decir, y en las galeras de España hay mas sosiego de aquel que
sería menester, aunque no es menester mucho más para lo que yo tengo de
escribir, porque me lo sé de coro.
— Hábil pareces —dijo don Quijote.
— Y desdichado —respondió Ginés—; porque siempre las desdichas persiguen al
buen ingenio.
— Persiguen a los bellacos —dijo el comisario.
— Ya le he dicho, señor comisario —respondió Pasamonte—, que se vaya poco a
poco, que aquellos señores no le dieron esa vara para que maltratase a los
pobretes que aquí vamos, sino para que nos guiase y llevase adonde Su
Majestad manda. Si no, ¡por vida de...! ¡Basta!, que podría ser que
saliesen algún día en la colada las manchas que se hicieron en la venta; y
todo el mundo calle, y viva bien, y hable mejor y caminemos, que ya es
mucho regodeo éste.
Alzó la vara en alto el comisario para dar a Pasamonte en respuesta de sus
amenazas, mas don Quijote se puso en medio y le rogó que no le maltratase,
pues no era mucho que quien llevaba tan atadas las manos tuviese algún
tanto suelta la lengua. Y, volviéndose a todos los de la cadena, dijo:
— De todo cuanto me habéis dicho, hermanos carísimos, he sacado en limpio
que, aunque os han castigado por vuestras culpas, las penas que vais a
padecer no os dan mucho gusto, y que vais a ellas muy de mala gana y muy
contra vuestra voluntad; y que podría ser que el poco ánimo que aquél tuvo
en el tormento, la falta de dineros déste, el poco favor del otro y,
finalmente, el torcido juicio del juez, hubiese sido causa de vuestra
perdición y de no haber salido con la justicia que de vuestra parte
teníades. Todo lo cual se me representa a mí ahora en la memoria de manera
que me está diciendo, persuadiendo y aun forzando que muestre con vosotros
el efeto para que el cielo me arrojó al mundo, y me hizo profesar en él la
orden de caballería que profeso, y el voto que en ella hice de favorecer a
los menesterosos y opresos de los mayores. Pero, porque sé que una de las
partes de la prudencia es que lo que se puede hacer por bien no se haga por
mal, quiero rogar a estos señores guardianes y comisario sean servidos de
desataros y dejaros ir en paz, que no faltarán otros que sirvan al rey en
mejores ocasiones; porque me parece duro caso hacer esclavos a los que Dios
y naturaleza hizo libres. Cuanto más, señores guardas —añadió don Quijote—,
que estos pobres no han cometido nada contra vosotros. Allá se lo haya cada
uno con su pecado; Dios hay en el cielo, que no se descuida de castigar al
malo ni de premiar al bueno, y no es bien que los hombres honrados sean
verdugos de los otros hombres, no yéndoles nada en ello. Pido esto con esta
mansedumbre y sosiego, porque tenga, si lo cumplís, algo que agradeceros;
y, cuando de grado no lo hagáis, esta lanza y esta espada, con el valor de
mi brazo, harán que lo hagáis por fuerza.
— ¡Donosa majadería! —respondió el comisario— ¡Bueno está el donaire con que
ha salido a cabo de rato! ¡Los forzados del rey quiere que le dejemos, como
si tuviéramos autoridad para soltarlos o él la tuviera para mandárnoslo!
Váyase vuestra merced, señor, norabuena, su camino adelante, y enderécese
ese bacín que trae en la cabeza, y no ande buscando tres pies al gato.
— ¡Vos sois el gato, y el rato, y el bellaco! —respondió don Quijote.
Y, diciendo y haciendo, arremetió con él tan presto que, sin que tuviese
lugar de ponerse en defensa, dio con él en el suelo, malherido de una
lanzada; y avínole bien, que éste era el de la escopeta. Las demás guardas
quedaron atónitas y suspensas del no esperado acontecimiento; pero,
volviendo sobre sí, pusieron mano a sus espadas los de a caballo, y los de
a pie a sus dardos, y arremetieron a don Quijote, que con mucho sosiego los
aguardaba; y, sin duda, lo pasara mal si los galeotes, viendo la ocasión
que se les ofrecía de alcanzar libertad, no la procuraran, procurando
romper la cadena donde venían ensartados. Fue la revuelta de manera que las
guardas, ya por acudir a los galeotes, que se desataban, ya por acometer a
don Quijote, que los acometía, no hicieron cosa que fuese de provecho.
Ayudó Sancho, por su parte, a la soltura de Ginés de Pasamonte, que fue el
primero que saltó en la campaña libre y desembarazado, y, arremetiendo al
comisario caído, le quitó la espada y la escopeta, con la cual, apuntando
al uno y señalando al otro, sin disparalla jamás, no quedó guarda en todo
el campo, porque se fueron huyendo, así de la escopeta de Pasamonte como de
las muchas pedradas que los ya sueltos galeotes les tiraban.
Entristecióse mucho Sancho deste suceso, porque se le representó que los
que iban huyendo habían de dar noticia del caso a la Santa Hermandad, la
cual, a campana herida, saldría a buscar los delincuentes, y así se lo dijo
a su amo, y le rogó que luego de allí se partiesen y se emboscasen en la
sierra, que estaba cerca.
— Bien está eso —dijo don Quijote—, pero yo sé lo que ahora conviene que se
haga.
Y, llamando a todos los galeotes, que andaban alborotados y habían
despojado al comisario hasta dejarle en cueros, se le pusieron todos a la
redonda para ver lo que les mandaba, y así les dijo:
— De gente bien nacida es agradecer los beneficios que reciben, y uno de los
pecados que más a Dios ofende es la ingratitud. Dígolo porque ya habéis
visto, señores, con manifiesta experiencia, el que de mí habéis recebido;
en pago del cual querría, y es mi voluntad, que, cargados de esa cadena que
quité de vuestros cuellos, luego os pongáis en camino y vais a la ciudad
del Toboso, y allí os presentéis ante la señora Dulcinea del Toboso y le
digáis que su caballero, el de la Triste Figura, se le envía a encomendar,
y le contéis, punto por punto, todos los que ha tenido esta famosa aventura
hasta poneros en la deseada libertad; y, hecho esto, os podréis ir donde
quisiéredes a la buena ventura.
Respondió por todos Ginés de Pasamonte, y dijo:
— Lo que vuestra merced nos manda, señor y libertador nuestro, es imposible
de toda imposibilidad cumplirlo, porque no podemos ir juntos por los
caminos, sino solos y divididos, y cada uno por su parte, procurando
meterse en las entrañas de la tierra, por no ser hallado de la Santa
Hermandad, que, sin duda alguna, ha de salir en nuestra busca. Lo que
vuestra merced puede hacer, y es justo que haga, es mudar ese servicio y
montazgo de la señora Dulcinea del Toboso en alguna cantidad de avemarías y
credos, que nosotros diremos por la intención de vuestra merced; y ésta es
cosa que se podrá cumplir de noche y de día, huyendo o reposando, en paz o
en guerra; pero pensar que hemos de volver ahora a las ollas de Egipto,
digo, a tomar nuestra cadena y a ponernos en camino del Toboso, es pensar
que es ahora de noche, que aún no son las diez del día, y es pedir a
nosotros eso como pedir peras al olmo.
— Pues ¡voto a tal! —dijo don Quijote, ya puesto en cólera—, don hijo de la
puta, don Ginesillo de Paropillo, o como os llamáis, que habéis de ir vos
solo, rabo entre piernas, con toda la cadena a cuestas.
Pasamonte, que no era nada bien sufrido, estando ya enterado que don
Quijote no era muy cuerdo, pues tal disparate había cometido como el de
querer darles libertad, viéndose tratar de aquella manera, hizo del ojo a
los compañeros, y, apartándose aparte, comenzaron a llover tantas piedras
sobre don Quijote, que no se daba manos a cubrirse con la rodela; y el
pobre de Rocinante no hacía más caso de la espuela que si fuera hecho de
bronce. Sancho se puso tras su asno, y con él se defendía de la nube y
pedrisco que sobre entrambos llovía. No se pudo escudar tan bien don
Quijote que no le acertasen no sé cuántos guijarros en el cuerpo, con tanta
fuerza que dieron con él en el suelo; y apenas hubo caído, cuando fue sobre
él el estudiante y le quitó la bacía de la cabeza, y diole con ella tres o
cuatro golpes en las espaldas y otros tantos en la tierra, con que la hizo
pedazos. Quitáronle una ropilla que traía sobre las armas, y las medias
calzas le querían quitar si las grebas no lo estorbaran. A Sancho le
quitaron el gabán, y, dejándole en pelota, repartiendo entre sí los demás
despojos de la batalla, se fueron cada uno por su parte, con más cuidado de
escaparse de la Hermandad, que temían, que de cargarse de la cadena e ir a
presentarse ante la señora Dulcinea del Toboso.
Solos quedaron jumento y Rocinante, Sancho y Don Quijote; el jumento,
cabizbajo y pensativo, sacudiendo de cuando en cuando las orejas, pensando
que aún no había cesado la borrasca de las piedras, que le perseguían los
oídos; Rocinante, tendido junto a su amo, que también vino al suelo de otra
pedrada; Sancho, en pelota y temeroso de la Santa Hermandad; don Quijote,
mohinísimo de verse tan malparado por los mismos a quien tanto bien había
hecho.
Capítulo XXIII. De lo que le aconteció al famoso don Quijote en Sierra
Morena, que fue una de las más raras aventuras que en esta verdadera
historia se cuentan
Viéndose tan malparado don Quijote, dijo a su escudero:
— Siempre, Sancho, lo he oído decir, que el hacer bien a villanos es echar
agua en la mar. Si yo hubiera creído lo que me dijiste, yo hubiera escusado
esta pesadumbre; pero ya está hecho: paciencia, y escarmentar para desde
aquí adelante.
— Así escarmentará vuestra merced —respondió Sancho— como yo soy turco;
pero, pues dice que si me hubiera creído se hubiera escusado este daño,
créame ahora y escusará otro mayor; porque le hago saber que con la Santa
Hermandad no hay usar de caballerías, que no se le da a ella por cuantos
caballeros andantes hay dos maravedís; y sepa que ya me parece que sus
saetas me zumban por los oídos.
— Naturalmente eres cobarde, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, pero, porque no
digas que soy contumaz y que jamás hago lo que me aconsejas, por esta vez
quiero tomar tu consejo y apartarme de la furia que tanto temes; mas ha de
ser con una condición: que jamás, en vida ni en muerte, has de decir a
nadie que yo me retiré y aparté deste peligro de miedo, sino por complacer
a tus ruegos; que si otra cosa dijeres, mentirás en ello, y desde ahora
para entonces, y desde entonces para ahora, te desmiento, y digo que
mientes y mentirás todas las veces que lo pensares o lo dijeres. Y no me
repliques más, que en sólo pensar que me aparto y retiro de algún peligro,
especialmente déste, que parece que lleva algún es no es de sombra de
miedo, estoy ya para quedarme, y para aguardar aquí solo, no solamente a la
Santa Hermandad que dices y temes, sino a los hermanos de los doce tribus
de Israel, y a los siete Macabeos, y a Cástor y a Pólux, y aun a todos los
hermanos y hermandades que hay en el mundo.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, que el retirar no es huir, ni el esperar es
cordura, cuando el peligro sobrepuja a la esperanza, y de sabios es
guardarse hoy para mañana y no aventurarse todo en un día. Y sepa que,
aunque zafio y villano, todavía se me alcanza algo desto que llaman buen
gobierno; así que, no se arrepienta de haber tomado mi consejo, sino suba
en Rocinante, si puede, o si no yo le ayudaré, y sígame, que el caletre me
dice que hemos menester ahora más los pies que las manos.
Subió don Quijote, sin replicarle más palabra, y, guiando Sancho sobre su
asno, se entraron por una parte de Sierra Morena, que allí junto estaba,
llevando Sancho intención de atravesarla toda e ir a salir al Viso, o a
Almodóvar del Campo, y esconderse algunos días por aquellas asperezas, por
no ser hallados si la Hermandad los buscase. Animóle a esto haber visto que
de la refriega de los galeotes se había escapado libre la despensa que
sobre su asno venía, cosa que la juzgó a milagro, según fue lo que llevaron
y buscaron los galeotes.
Así como don Quijote entró por aquellas montañas, se le alegró el corazón,
pareciéndole aquellos lugares acomodados para las aventuras que buscaba.
Reducíansele a la memoria los maravillosos acaecimientos que en semejantes
soledades y asperezas habían sucedido a caballeros andantes. Iba pensando
en estas cosas, tan embebecido y trasportado en ellas que de ninguna otra
se acordaba. Ni Sancho llevaba otro cuidado —después que le pareció que
caminaba por parte segura— sino de satisfacer su estómago con los relieves
que del despojo clerical habían quedado; y así, iba tras su amo sentado a
la mujeriega sobre su jumento, sacando de un costal y embaulando en su
panza; y no se le diera por hallar otra ventura, entretanto que iba de
aquella manera, un ardite.
En esto, alzó los ojos y vio que su amo estaba parado, procurando con la
punta del lanzón alzar no sé qué bulto que estaba caído en el suelo, por lo
cual se dio priesa a llegar a ayudarle si fuese menester; y cuando llegó
fue a tiempo que alzaba con la punta del lanzón un cojín y una maleta asida
a él, medio podridos, o podridos del todo, y deshechos; mas, pesaba tanto,
que fue necesario que Sancho se apease a tomarlos, y mandóle su amo que
viese lo que en la maleta venía.
Hízolo con mucha presteza Sancho, y, aunque la maleta venía cerrada con una
cadena y su candado, por lo roto y podrido della vio lo que en ella había,
que eran cuatro camisas de delgada holanda y otras cosas de lienzo, no
menos curiosas que limpias, y en un pañizuelo halló un buen montoncillo de
escudos de oro; y, así como los vio, dijo:
— ¡Bendito sea todo el cielo, que nos ha deparado una aventura que sea de
provecho!
Y buscando más, halló un librillo de memoria, ricamente guarnecido. Éste le
pidió don Quijote, y mandóle que guardase el dinero y lo tomase para él.
Besóle las manos Sancho por la merced, y, desvalijando a la valija de su
lencería, la puso en el costal de la despensa. Todo lo cual visto por don
Quijote, dijo:
— Paréceme, Sancho, y no es posible que sea otra cosa, que algún caminante
descaminado debió de pasar por esta sierra, y, salteándole malandrines, le
debieron de matar, y le trujeron a enterrar en esta tan escondida parte.
— No puede ser eso —respondió Sancho—, porque si fueran ladrones, no se
dejaran aquí este dinero.
— Verdad dices —dijo don Quijote—, y así, no adivino ni doy en lo que esto
pueda ser; mas, espérate: veremos si en este librillo de memoria hay alguna
cosa escrita por donde podamos rastrear y venir en conocimiento de lo que
deseamos.
Abrióle, y lo primero que halló en él escrito, como en borrador, aunque de
muy buena letra, fue un soneto, que, leyéndole alto porque Sancho también
lo oyese, vio que decía desta manera:
O le falta al Amor conocimiento,
o le sobra crueldad, o no es mi pena
igual a la ocasión que me condena
al género más duro de tormento.
Pero si Amor es dios, es argumento
que nada ignora, y es razón muy buena
que un dios no sea cruel. Pues, ¿quién ordena
el terrible dolor que adoro y siento?
Si digo que sois vos, Fili, no acierto;
que tanto mal en tanto bien no cabe,
ni me viene del cielo esta rüina.
Presto habré de morir, que es lo más cierto;
que al mal de quien la causa no se sabe
milagro es acertar la medicina.
— Por esa trova —dijo Sancho— no se puede saber nada, si ya no es que por
ese hilo que está ahí se saque el ovillo de todo.
— ¿Qué hilo está aquí? —dijo don Quijote.
— Paréceme —dijo Sancho— que vuestra merced nombró ahí hilo.
— No dije sino Fili —respondió don Quijote—, y éste, sin duda, es el nombre
de la dama de quien se queja el autor deste soneto; y a fe que debe de ser
razonable poeta, o yo sé poco del arte.
— Luego, ¿también —dijo Sancho— se le entiende a vuestra merced de trovas?
— Y más de lo que tú piensas —respondió don Quijote—, y veráslo cuando
lleves una carta, escrita en verso de arriba abajo, a mi señora Dulcinea
del Toboso. Porque quiero que sepas, Sancho, que todos o los más caballeros
andantes de la edad pasada eran grandes trovadores y grandes músicos; que
estas dos habilidades, o gracias, por mejor decir, son anexas a los
enamorados andantes. Verdad es que las coplas de los pasados caballeros
tienen más de espíritu que de primor.
— Lea más vuestra merced —dijo Sancho—, que ya hallará algo que nos
satisfaga.
Volvió la hoja don Quijote y dijo:
— Esto es prosa, y parece carta.
— ¿Carta misiva, señor? —preguntó Sancho.
— En el principio no parece sino de amores —respondió don Quijote.
— Pues lea vuestra merced alto —dijo Sancho—, que gusto mucho destas cosas
de amores.
— Que me place —dijo don Quijote.
Y, leyéndola alto, como Sancho se lo había rogado, vio que decía desta
manera:
Tu falsa promesa y mi cierta desventura me llevan a parte donde antes
volverán a tus oídos las nuevas de mi muerte que las razones de mis quejas.
Desechásteme, ¡oh ingrata!, por quien tiene más, no por quien vale más que
yo; mas si la virtud fuera riqueza que se estimara, no envidiara yo dichas
ajenas ni llorara desdichas propias. Lo que levantó tu hermosura han
derribado tus obras: por ella entendí que eras ángel, y por ellas conozco
que eres mujer. Quédate en paz, causadora de mi guerra, y haga el cielo que
los engaños de tu esposo estén siempre encubiertos, porque tú no quedes
arrepentida de lo que heciste y yo no tome venganza de lo que no deseo.
Acabando de leer la carta, dijo don Quijote:
— Menos por ésta que por los versos se puede sacar más de que quien la
escribió es algún desdeñado amante.
Y, hojeando casi todo el librillo, halló otros versos y cartas, que algunos
pudo leer y otros no; pero lo que todos contenían eran quejas, lamentos,
desconfianzas, sabores y sinsabores, favores y desdenes, solenizados los
unos y llorados los otros.
En tanto que don Quijote pasaba el libro, pasaba Sancho la maleta, sin
dejar rincón en toda ella, ni en el cojín, que no buscase, escudriñase e
inquiriese, ni costura que no deshiciese, ni vedija de lana que no
escarmenase, porque no se quedase nada por diligencia ni mal recado: tal
golosina habían despertado en él los hallados escudos, que pasaban de
ciento. Y, aunque no halló mas de lo hallado, dio por bien empleados los
vuelos de la manta, el vomitar del brebaje, las bendiciones de las estacas,
las puñadas del arriero, la falta de las alforjas, el robo del gabán y toda
la hambre, sed y cansancio que había pasado en servicio de su buen señor,
pareciéndole que estaba más que rebién pagado con la merced recebida de la
entrega del hallazgo.
Con gran deseo quedó el Caballero de la Triste Figura de saber quién fuese
el dueño de la maleta, conjeturando, por el soneto y carta, por el dinero
en oro y por las tan buenas camisas, que debía de ser de algún principal
enamorado, a quien desdenes y malos tratamientos de su dama debían de haber
conducido a algún desesperado término. Pero, como por aquel lugar
inhabitable y escabroso no parecía persona alguna de quien poder
informarse, no se curó de más que de pasar adelante, sin llevar otro camino
que aquel que Rocinante quería, que era por donde él podía caminar, siempre
con imaginación que no podía faltar por aquellas malezas alguna estraña
aventura.
Yendo, pues, con este pensamiento, vio que, por cima de una montañuela que
delante de los ojos se le ofrecía, iba saltando un hombre, de risco en
risco y de mata en mata, con estraña ligereza. Figurósele que iba desnudo,
la barba negra y espesa, los cabellos muchos y rabultados, los pies
descalzos y las piernas sin cosa alguna; los muslos cubrían unos calzones,
al parecer de terciopelo leonado, mas tan hechos pedazos que por muchas
partes se le descubrían las carnes. Traía la cabeza descubierta, y, aunque
pasó con la ligereza que se ha dicho, todas estas menudencias miró y notó
el Caballero de la Triste Figura; y, aunque lo procuró, no pudo seguille,
porque no era dado a la debilidad de Rocinante andar por aquellas
asperezas, y más siendo él de suyo pisacorto y flemático. Luego imaginó don
Quijote que aquél era el dueño del cojín y de la maleta, y propuso en sí de
buscalle, aunque supiese andar un año por aquellas montañas hasta hallarle;
y así, mandó a Sancho que se apease del asno y atajase por la una parte de
la montaña, que él iría por la otra y podría ser que topasen, con esta
diligencia, con aquel hombre que con tanta priesa se les había quitado de
delante.
— No podré hacer eso —respondió Sancho—, porque, en apartándome de vuestra
merced, luego es conmigo el miedo, que me asalta con mil géneros de
sobresaltos y visiones. Y sírvale esto que digo de aviso, para que de aquí
adelante no me aparte un dedo de su presencia.
— Así será —dijo el de la Triste Figura—, y yo estoy muy contento de que te
quieras valer de mi ánimo, el cual no te ha de faltar, aunque te falte el
ánima del cuerpo. Y vente ahora tras mí poco a poco, o como pudieres, y haz
de los ojos lanternas; rodearemos esta serrezuela: quizá toparemos con
aquel hombre que vimos, el cual, sin duda alguna, no es otro que el dueño
de nuestro hallazgo.
A lo que Sancho respondió:
— Harto mejor sería no buscalle, porque si le hallamos y acaso fuese el
dueño del dinero, claro está que lo tengo de restituir; y así, fuera mejor,
sin hacer esta inútil diligencia, poseerlo yo con buena fe hasta que, por
otra vía menos curiosa y diligente, pareciera su verdadero señor; y quizá
fuera a tiempo que lo hubiera gastado, y entonces el rey me hacía franco.
— Engáñaste en eso, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—; que, ya que hemos caído
en sospecha de quién es el dueño, cuasi delante, estamos obligados a
buscarle y volvérselos; y, cuando no le buscásemos, la vehemente sospecha
que tenemos de que él lo sea nos pone ya en tanta culpa como si lo fuese.
Así que, Sancho amigo, no te dé pena el buscalle, por la que a mí se me
quitará si le hallo.
Y así, picó a Rocinante, y siguióle Sancho con su acostumbrado jumento; y,
habiendo rodeado parte de la montaña, hallaron en un arroyo, caída, muerta
y medio comida de perros y picada de grajos, una mula ensillada y
enfrenada; todo lo cual confirmó en ellos más la sospecha de que aquel que
huía era el dueño de la mula y del cojín.
Estándola mirando, oyeron un silbo como de pastor que guardaba ganado, y a
deshora, a su siniestra mano, parecieron una buena cantidad de cabras, y
tras ellas, por cima de la montaña, pareció el cabrero que las guardaba,
que era un hombre anciano. Diole voces don Quijote, y rogóle que bajase
donde estaban. Él respondió a gritos que quién les había traído por aquel
lugar, pocas o ningunas veces pisado sino de pies de cabras o de lobos y
otras fieras que por allí andaban. Respondióle Sancho que bajase, que de
todo le darían buena cuenta. Bajó el cabrero, y, en llegando adonde don
Quijote estaba, dijo:
— Apostaré que está mirando la mula de alquiler que está muerta en esa
hondonada. Pues a buena fe que ha ya seis meses que está en ese lugar.
Díganme: ¿han topado por ahí a su dueño?
— No hemos topado a nadie —respondió don Quijote—, sino a un cojín y a una
maletilla que no lejos deste lugar hallamos.
— También la hallé yo —respondió el cabrero—, mas nunca la quise alzar ni
llegar a ella, temeroso de algún desmán y de que no me la pidiesen por de
hurto; que es el diablo sotil, y debajo de los pies se levanta allombre
cosa donde tropiece y caya, sin saber cómo ni cómo no.
— Eso mesmo es lo que yo digo —respondió Sancho—: que también la hallé yo, y
no quise llegar a ella con un tiro de piedra; allí la dejé y allí se queda
como se estaba, que no quiero perro con cencerro.
— Decidme, buen hombre —dijo don Quijote—, ¿sabéis vos quién sea el dueño
destas prendas?
— Lo que sabré yo decir —dijo el cabrero— es que «habrá al pie de seis
meses, poco más a menos, que llegó a una majada de pastores, que estará
como tres leguas deste lugar, un mancebo de gentil talle y apostura,
caballero sobre esa mesma mula que ahí está muerta, y con el mesmo cojín y
maleta que decís que hallastes y no tocastes. Preguntónos que cuál parte
desta sierra era la más áspera y escondida; dijímosle que era esta donde
ahora estamos; y es ansí la verdad, porque si entráis media legua más
adentro, quizá no acertaréis a salir; y estoy maravillado de cómo habéis
podido llegar aquí, porque no hay camino ni senda que a este lugar
encamine. Digo, pues, que, en oyendo nuestra respuesta el mancebo, volvió
las riendas y encaminó hacia el lugar donde le señalamos, dejándonos a
todos contentos de su buen talle, y admirados de su demanda y de la priesa
con que le víamos caminar y volverse hacia la sierra; y desde entonces
nunca más le vimos, hasta que desde allí a algunos días salió al camino a
uno de nuestros pastores, y, sin decille nada, se llegó a él y le dio
muchas puñadas y coces, y luego se fue a la borrica del hato y le quitó
cuanto pan y queso en ella traía; y, con estraña ligereza, hecho esto, se
volvió a emboscar en la sierra. Como esto supimos algunos cabreros, le
anduvimos a buscar casi dos días por lo más cerrado desta sierra, al cabo
de los cuales le hallamos metido en el hueco de un grueso y valiente
alcornoque. Salió a nosotros con mucha mansedumbre, ya roto el vestido, y
el rostro disfigurado y tostado del sol, de tal suerte que apenas le
conocíamos, sino que los vestidos, aunque rotos, con la noticia que dellos
teníamos, nos dieron a entender que era el que buscábamos. Saludónos
cortésmente, y en pocas y muy buenas razones nos dijo que no nos
maravillásemos de verle andar de aquella suerte, porque así le convenía
para cumplir cierta penitencia que por sus muchos pecados le había sido
impuesta. Rogámosle que nos dijese quién era, mas nunca lo pudimos acabar
con él. Pedímosle también que, cuando hubiese menester el sustento, sin el
cual no podía pasar, nos dijese dónde le hallaríamos, porque con mucho amor
y cuidado se lo llevaríamos; y que si esto tampoco fuese de su gusto, que,
a lo menos, saliese a pedirlo, y no a quitarlo a los pastores. Agradeció
nuestro ofrecimiento, pidió perdón de los asaltos pasados, y ofreció de
pedillo de allí adelante por amor de Dios, sin dar molestia alguna a nadie.
En cuanto lo que tocaba a la estancia de su habitación, dijo que no tenía
otra que aquella que le ofrecía la ocasión donde le tomaba la noche; y
acabó su plática con un tan tierno llanto, que bien fuéramos de piedra los
que escuchado le habíamos, si en él no le acompañáramos, considerándole
cómo le habíamos visto la vez primera, y cuál le veíamos entonces. Porque,
como tengo dicho, era un muy gentil y agraciado mancebo, y en sus corteses
y concertadas razones mostraba ser bien nacido y muy cortesana persona;
que, puesto que éramos rústicos los que le escuchábamos, su gentileza era
tanta, que bastaba a darse a conocer a la mesma rusticidad. Y, estando en
lo mejor de su plática, paró y enmudecióse; clavó los ojos en el suelo por
un buen espacio, en el cual todos estuvimos quedos y suspensos, esperando
en qué había de parar aquel embelesamiento, con no poca lástima de verlo;
porque, por lo que hacía de abrir los ojos, estar fijo mirando al suelo sin
mover pestaña gran rato, y otras veces cerrarlos, apretando los labios y
enarcando las cejas, fácilmente conocimos que algún accidente de locura le
había sobrevenido. Mas él nos dio a entender presto ser verdad lo que
pensábamos, porque se levantó con gran furia del suelo, donde se había
echado, y arremetió con el primero que halló junto a sí, con tal denuedo y
rabia que, si no se le quitáramos, le matara a puñadas y a bocados; y todo
esto hacía, diciendo: ''¡Ah, fementido Fernando! ¡Aquí, aquí me pagarás la
sinrazón que me heciste: estas manos te sacarán el corazón, donde albergan
y tienen manida todas las maldades juntas, principalmente la fraude y el
engaño!'' Y a éstas añadía otras razones, que todas se encaminaban a decir
mal de aquel Fernando y a tacharle de traidor y fementido. Quitámossele,
pues, con no poca pesadumbre, y él, sin decir más palabra, se apartó de
nosotros y se emboscó corriendo por entre estos jarales y malezas, de modo
que nos imposibilitó el seguille. Por esto conjeturamos que la locura le
venía a tiempos, y que alguno que se llamaba Fernando le debía de haber
hecho alguna mala obra, tan pesada cuanto lo mostraba el término a que le
había conducido. Todo lo cual se ha confirmado después acá con las veces,
que han sido muchas, que él ha salido al camino, unas a pedir a los
pastores le den de lo que llevan para comer y otras a quitárselo por
fuerza; porque cuando está con el accidente de la locura, aunque los
pastores se lo ofrezcan de buen grado, no lo admite, sino que lo toma a
puñadas; y cuando está en su seso, lo pide por amor de Dios, cortés y
comedidamente, y rinde por ello muchas gracias, y no con falta de lágrimas.
Y en verdad os digo, señores —prosiguió el cabrero—, que ayer determinamos
yo y cuatro zagales, los dos criados y los dos amigos míos, de buscarle
hasta tanto que le hallemos, y, después de hallado, ya por fuerza ya por
grado, le hemos de llevar a la villa de Almodóvar, que está de aquí ocho
leguas, y allí le curaremos, si es que su mal tiene cura, o sabremos quién
es cuando esté en sus seso, y si tiene parientes a quien dar noticia de su
desgracia». Esto es, señores, lo que sabré deciros de lo que me habéis
preguntado; y entended que el dueño de las prendas que hallastes es el
mesmo que vistes pasar con tanta ligereza como desnudez —que ya le había
dicho don Quijote cómo había visto pasar aquel hombre saltando por la
sierra.
El cual quedó admirado de lo que al cabrero había oído, y quedó con más
deseo de saber quién era el desdichado loco; y propuso en sí lo mesmo que
ya tenía pensado: de buscalle por toda la montaña, sin dejar rincón ni
cueva en ella que no mirase, hasta hallarle. Pero hízolo mejor la suerte de
lo que él pensaba ni esperaba, porque en aquel mesmo instante pareció, por
entre una quebrada de una sierra que salía donde ellos estaban, el mancebo
que buscaba, el cual venía hablando entre sí cosas que no podían ser
entendidas de cerca, cuanto más de lejos. Su traje era cual se ha pintado,
sólo que, llegando cerca, vio don Quijote que un coleto hecho pedazos que
sobre sí traía era de ámbar; por donde acabó de entender que persona que
tales hábitos traía no debía de ser de ínfima calidad.
En llegando el mancebo a ellos, les saludó con una voz desentonada y
bronca, pero con mucha cortesía. Don Quijote le volvió las saludes con no
menos comedimiento, y, apeándose de Rocinante, con gentil continente y
donaire, le fue a abrazar y le tuvo un buen espacio estrechamente entre sus
brazos, como si de luengos tiempos le hubiera conocido. El otro, a quien
podemos llamar el Roto de la Mala Figura —como a don Quijote el de la
Triste—, después de haberse dejado abrazar, le apartó un poco de sí, y,
puestas sus manos en los hombros de don Quijote, le estuvo mirando, como
que quería ver si le conocía; no menos admirado quizá de ver la figura,
talle y armas de don Quijote, que don Quijote lo estaba de verle a él. En
resolución, el primero que habló después del abrazamiento fue el Roto, y
dijo lo que se dirá adelante.
Capítulo XXIV. Donde se prosigue la aventura de la Sierra Morena
Dice la historia que era grandísima la atención con que don Quijote
escuchaba al astroso Caballero de la Sierra, el cual, prosiguiendo su
plática, dijo:
— Por cierto, señor, quienquiera que seáis, que yo no os conozco, yo os
agradezco las muestras y la cortesía que conmigo habéis usado; y quisiera
yo hallarme en términos que con más que la voluntad pudiera servir la que
habéis mostrado tenerme en el buen acogimiento que me habéis hecho, mas no
quiere mi suerte darme otra cosa con que corresponda a las buenas obras que
me hacen, que buenos deseos de satisfacerlas.
— Los que yo tengo —respondió don Quijote— son de serviros; tanto, que tenía
determinado de no salir destas sierras hasta hallaros y saber de vos si el
dolor que en la estrañeza de vuestra vida mostráis tener se podía hallar
algún género de remedio; y si fuera menester buscarle, buscarle con la
diligencia posible. Y, cuando vuestra desventura fuera de aquellas que
tienen cerradas las puertas a todo género de consuelo, pensaba ayudaros a
llorarla y plañirla como mejor pudiera, que todavía es consuelo en las
desgracias hallar quien se duela dellas. Y, si es que mi buen intento
merece ser agradecido con algún género de cortesía, yo os suplico, señor,
por la mucha que veo que en vos se encierra, y juntamente os conjuro por la
cosa que en esta vida más habéis amado o amáis, que me digáis quién sois y
la causa que os ha traído a vivir y a morir entre estas soledades como
bruto animal, pues moráis entre ellos tan ajeno de vos mismo cual lo
muestra vuestro traje y persona. Y juro —añadió don Quijote—, por la orden
de caballería que recebí, aunque indigno y pecador, y por la profesión de
caballero andante, que si en esto, señor, me complacéis, de serviros con
las veras a que me obliga el ser quien soy: ora remediando vuestra
desgracia, si tiene remedio, ora ayudándoos a llorarla, como os lo he
prometido.
El Caballero del Bosque, que de tal manera oyó hablar al de la Triste
Figura, no hacía sino mirarle, y remirarle y tornarle a mirar de arriba
abajo; y, después que le hubo bien mirado, le dijo:
— Si tienen algo que darme a comer, por amor de Dios que me lo den; que,
después de haber comido, yo haré todo lo que se me manda, en agradecimiento
de tan buenos deseos como aquí se me han mostrado.
Luego sacaron, Sancho de su costal y el cabrero de su zurrón, con que
satisfizo el Roto su hambre, comiendo lo que le dieron como persona
atontada, tan apriesa que no daba espacio de un bocado al otro, pues antes
los engullía que tragaba; y, en tanto que comía, ni él ni los que le
miraban hablaban palabra. Como acabó de comer, les hizo de señas que le
siguiesen, como lo hicieron, y él los llevó a un verde pradecillo que a la
vuelta de una peña poco desviada de allí estaba. En llegando a él se tendió
en el suelo, encima de la yerba, y los demás hicieron lo mismo; y todo esto
sin que ninguno hablase, hasta que el Roto, después de haberse acomodado en
su asiento, dijo:
— Si gustáis, señores, que os diga en breves razones la inmensidad de mis
desventuras, habéisme de prometer de que con ninguna pregunta, ni otra
cosa, no interromperéis el hilo de mi triste historia; porque en el punto
que lo hagáis, en ése se quedará lo que fuere contando.
Estas razones del Roto trujeron a la memoria a don Quijote el cuento que le
había contado su escudero, cuando no acertó el número de las cabras que
habían pasado el río y se quedó la historia pendiente. Pero, volviendo al
Roto, prosiguió diciendo:
— Esta prevención que hago es porque querría pasar brevemente por el cuento
de mis desgracias; que el traerlas a la memoria no me sirve de otra cosa
que añadir otras de nuevo, y, mientras menos me preguntáredes, más presto
acabaré yo de decillas, puesto que no dejaré por contar cosa alguna que sea
de importancia para no satisfacer del todo a vuestro deseo.
Don Quijote se lo prometió, en nombre de los demás, y él, con este seguro,
comenzó desta manera:
— «Mi nombre es Cardenio; mi patria, una ciudad de las mejores desta
Andalucía; mi linaje, noble; mis padres, ricos; mi desventura, tanta que la
deben de haber llorado mis padres y sentido mi linaje, sin poderla aliviar
con su riqueza; que para remediar desdichas del cielo poco suelen valer los
bienes de fortuna. Vivía en esta mesma tierra un cielo, donde puso el amor
toda la gloria que yo acertara a desearme: tal es la hermosura de Luscinda,
doncella tan noble y tan rica como yo, pero de más ventura y de menos
firmeza de la que a mis honrados pensamientos se debía. A esta Luscinda
amé, quise y adoré desde mis tiernos y primeros años, y ella me quiso a mí
con aquella sencillez y buen ánimo que su poca edad permitía. Sabían
nuestros padres nuestros intentos, y no les pesaba dello, porque bien veían
que, cuando pasaran adelante, no podían tener otro fin que el de casarnos,
cosa que casi la concertaba la igualdad de nuestro linaje y riquezas.
Creció la edad, y con ella el amor de entrambos, que al padre de Luscinda
le pareció que por buenos respetos estaba obligado a negarme la entrada de
su casa, casi imitando en esto a los padres de aquella Tisbe tan decantada
de los poetas. Y fue esta negación añadir llama a llama y deseo a deseo,
porque, aunque pusieron silencio a las lenguas, no le pudieron poner a las
plumas, las cuales, con más libertad que las lenguas, suelen dar a entender
a quien quieren lo que en el alma está encerrado; que muchas veces la
presencia de la cosa amada turba y enmudece la intención más determinada y
la lengua más atrevida. ¡Ay cielos, y cuántos billetes le escribí! ¡Cuán
regaladas y honestas respuestas tuve! ¡Cuántas canciones compuse y cuántos
enamorados versos, donde el alma declaraba y trasladaba sus sentimientos,
pintaba sus encendidos deseos, entretenía sus memorias y recreaba su
voluntad!
»En efeto, viéndome apurado, y que mi alma se consumía con el deseo de
verla, determiné poner por obra y acabar en un punto lo que me pareció que
más convenía para salir con mi deseado y merecido premio; y fue el
pedírsela a su padre por legítima esposa, como lo hice; a lo que él me
respondió que me agradecía la voluntad que mostraba de honralle, y de
querer honrarme con prendas suyas, pero que, siendo mi padre vivo, a él
tocaba de justo derecho hacer aquella demanda; porque, si no fuese con
mucha voluntad y gusto suyo, no era Luscinda mujer para tomarse ni darse a
hurto.
»Yo le agradecí su buen intento, pareciéndome que llevaba razón en lo que
decía, y que mi padre vendría en ello como yo se lo dijese; y con este
intento, luego en aquel mismo instante, fui a decirle a mi padre lo que
deseaba. Y, al tiempo que entré en un aposento donde estaba, le hallé con
una carta abierta en la mano, la cual, antes que yo le dijese palabra, me
la dio y me dijo: ''Por esa carta verás, Cardenio, la voluntad que el duque
Ricardo tiene de hacerte merced''.» Este duque Ricardo, como ya vosotros,
señores, debéis de saber, es un grande de España que tiene su estado en lo
mejor desta Andalucía. «Tomé y leí la carta, la cual venía tan encarecida
que a mí mesmo me pareció mal si mi padre dejaba de cumplir lo que en ella
se le pedía, que era que me enviase luego donde él estaba; que quería que
fuese compañero, no criado, de su hijo el mayor, y que él tomaba a cargo el
ponerme en estado que correspondiese a la estimación en que me tenía. Leí
la carta y enmudecí leyéndola, y más cuando oí que mi padre me decía: ''De
aquí a dos días te partirás, Cardenio, a hacer la voluntad del duque; y da
gracias a Dios que te va abriendo camino por donde alcances lo que yo sé
que mereces''. Añadió a éstas otras razones de padre consejero.
»Llegóse el término de mi partida, hablé una noche a Luscinda, díjele todo
lo que pasaba, y lo mesmo hice a su padre, suplicándole se entretuviese
algunos días y dilatase el darle estado hasta que yo viese lo que Ricardo
me quería. Él me lo prometió y ella me lo confirmó con mil juramentos y mil
desmayos. Vine, en fin, donde el duque Ricardo estaba. Fui dél tan bien
recebido y tratado, que desde luego comenzó la envidia a hacer su oficio,
teniéndomela los criados antiguos, pareciéndoles que las muestras que el
duque daba de hacerme merced habían de ser en perjuicio suyo. Pero el que
más se holgó con mi ida fue un hijo segundo del duque, llamado Fernando,
mozo gallardo, gentilhombre, liberal y enamorado, el cual, en poco tiempo,
quiso que fuese tan su amigo, que daba que decir a todos; y, aunque el
mayor me quería bien y me hacía merced, no llegó al estremo con que don
Fernando me quería y trataba.
»Es, pues, el caso que, como entre los amigos no hay cosa secreta que no se
comunique, y la privanza que yo tenía con don Fernando dejada de serlo por
ser amistad, todos sus pensamientos me declaraba, especialmente uno
enamorado, que le traía con un poco de desasosiego. Quería bien a una
labradora, vasalla de su padre (y ella los tenía muy ricos), y era tan
hermosa, recatada, discreta y honesta que nadie que la conocía se
determinaba en cuál destas cosas tuviese más excelencia ni más se
aventajase. Estas tan buenas partes de la hermosa labradora redujeron a tal
término los deseos de don Fernando, que se determinó, para poder alcanzarlo
y conquistar la entereza de la labradora, darle palabra de ser su esposo,
porque de otra manera era procurar lo imposible. Yo, obligado de su
amistad, con las mejores razones que supe y con los más vivos ejemplos que
pude, procuré estorbarle y apartarle de tal propósito. Pero, viendo que no
aprovechaba, determiné de decirle el caso al duque Ricardo, su padre. Mas
don Fernando, como astuto y discreto, se receló y temió desto, por
parecerle que estaba yo obligado, en vez de buen criado, no tener
encubierta cosa que tan en perjuicio de la honra de mi señor el duque
venía; y así, por divertirme y engañarme, me dijo que no hallaba otro mejor
remedio para poder apartar de la memoria la hermosura que tan sujeto le
tenía, que el ausentarse por algunos meses; y que quería que el ausencia
fuese que los dos nos viniésemos en casa de mi padre, con ocasión que
darían al duque que venía a ver y a feriar unos muy buenos caballos que en
mi ciudad había, que es madre de los mejores del mundo.
»Apenas le oí yo decir esto, cuando, movido de mi afición, aunque su
determinación no fuera tan buena, la aprobara yo por una de las más
acertadas que se podían imaginar, por ver cuán buena ocasión y coyuntura se
me ofrecía de volver a ver a mi Luscinda. Con este pensamiento y deseo,
aprobé su parecer y esforcé su propósito, diciéndole que lo pusiese por
obra con la brevedad posible, porque, en efeto, la ausencia hacía su
oficio, a pesar de los más firmes pensamientos. Ya cuando él me vino a
decir esto, según después se supo, había gozado a la labradora con título
de esposo, y esperaba ocasión de descubrirse a su salvo, temeroso de lo que
el duque su padre haría cuando supiese su disparate.
»Sucedió, pues, que, como el amor en los mozos, por la mayor parte, no lo
es, sino apetito, el cual, como tiene por último fin el deleite, en
llegando a alcanzarle se acaba y ha de volver atrás aquello que parecía
amor, porque no puede pasar adelante del término que le puso naturaleza, el
cual término no le puso a lo que es verdadero amor...; quiero decir que,
así como don Fernando gozó a la labradora, se le aplacaron sus deseos y se
resfriaron sus ahíncos; y si primero fingía quererse ausentar, por
remediarlos, ahora de veras procuraba irse, por no ponerlos en ejecución.
Diole el duque licencia, y mandóme que le acompañase. Venimos a mi ciudad,
recibióle mi padre como quien era; vi yo luego a Luscinda, tornaron a
vivir, aunque no habían estado muertos ni amortiguados, mis deseos, de los
cuales di cuenta, por mi mal, a don Fernando, por parecerme que, en la ley
de la mucha amistad que mostraba, no le debía encubrir nada. Alabéle la
hermosura, donaire y discreción de Luscinda de tal manera, que mis
alabanzas movieron en él los deseos de querer ver doncella de tantas buenas
partes adornada. Cumplíselos yo, por mi corta suerte, enseñándosela una
noche, a la luz de una vela, por una ventana por donde los dos solíamos
hablarnos. Viola en sayo, tal, que todas las bellezas hasta entonces por él
vistas las puso en olvido. Enmudeció, perdió el sentido, quedó absorto y,
finalmente, tan enamorado cual lo veréis en el discurso del cuento de mi
desventura. Y, para encenderle más el deseo, que a mí me celaba y al cielo
a solas descubría, quiso la fortuna que hallase un día un billete suyo
pidiéndome que la pidiese a su padre por esposa, tan discreto, tan honesto
y tan enamorado que, en leyéndolo, me dijo que en sola Luscinda se
encerraban todas las gracias de hermosura y de entendimiento que en las
demás mujeres del mundo estaban repartidas.
»Bien es verdad que quiero confesar ahora que, puesto que yo veía con cuán
justas causas don Fernando a Luscinda alababa, me pesaba de oír aquellas
alabanzas de su boca, y comencé a temer y a recelarme dél, porque no se
pasaba momento donde no quisiese que tratásemos de Luscinda, y él movía la
plática, aunque la trujese por los cabellos; cosa que despertaba en mí un
no sé qué de celos, no porque yo temiese revés alguno de la bondad y de la
fe de Luscinda, pero, con todo eso, me hacía temer mi suerte lo mesmo que
ella me aseguraba. Procuraba siempre don Fernando leer los papeles que yo a
Luscinda enviaba y los que ella me respondía, a título que de la discreción
de los dos gustaba mucho. Acaeció, pues, que, habiéndome pedido Luscinda un
libro de caballerías en que leer, de quien era ella muy aficionada, que era
el de Amadís de Gaula...»
No hubo bien oído don Quijote nombrar libro de caballerías, cuando dijo:
— Con que me dijera vuestra merced, al principio de su historia, que su
merced de la señora Luscinda era aficionada a libros de caballerías, no
fuera menester otra exageración para darme a entender la alteza de su
entendimiento, porque no le tuviera tan bueno como vos, señor, le habéis
pintado, si careciera del gusto de tan sabrosa leyenda: así que, para
conmigo, no es menester gastar más palabras en declararme su hermosura,
valor y entendimiento; que, con sólo haber entendido su afición, la
confirmo por la más hermosa y más discreta mujer del mundo. Y quisiera yo,
señor, que vuestra merced le hubiera enviado junto con Amadís de Gaula al
bueno de Don Rugel de Grecia, que yo sé que gustara la señora Luscinda
mucho de Daraida y Geraya, y de las discreciones del pastor Darinel y de
aquellos admirables versos de sus bucólicas, cantadas y representadas por
él con todo donaire, discreción y desenvoltura. Pero tiempo podrá venir en
que se enmiende esa falta, y no dura más en hacerse la enmienda de cuanto
quiera vuestra merced ser servido de venirse conmigo a mi aldea, que allí
le podré dar más de trecientos libros, que son el regalo de mi alma y el
entretenimiento de mi vida; aunque tengo para mí que ya no tengo ninguno,
merced a la malicia de malos y envidiosos encantadores. Y perdóneme vuestra
merced el haber contravenido a lo que prometimos de no interromper su
plática, pues, en oyendo cosas de caballerías y de caballeros andantes, así
es en mi mano dejar de hablar en ellos, como lo es en la de los rayos del
sol dejar de calentar, ni humedecer en los de la luna. Así que, perdón y
proseguir, que es lo que ahora hace más al caso.
En tanto que don Quijote estaba diciendo lo que queda dicho, se le había
caído a Cardenio la cabeza sobre el pecho, dando muestras de estar
profundamente pensativo. Y, puesto que dos veces le dijo don Quijote que
prosiguiese su historia, ni alzaba la cabeza ni respondía palabra; pero, al
cabo de un buen espacio, la levantó y dijo:
— No se me puede quitar del pensamiento, ni habrá quien me lo quite en el
mundo, ni quien me dé a entender otra cosa (y sería un majadero el que lo
contrario entendiese o creyese), sino que aquel bellaconazo del maestro
Elisabat estaba amancebado con la reina Madésima.
— Eso no, ¡voto a tal! —respondió con mucha cólera don Quijote (y arrojóle,
como tenía de costumbre)—; y ésa es una muy gran malicia, o bellaquería,
por mejor decir: la reina Madásima fue muy principal señora, y no se ha de
presumir que tan alta princesa se había de amancebar con un sacapotras; y
quien lo contrario entendiere, miente como muy gran bellaco. Y yo se lo
daré a entender, a pie o a caballo, armado o desarmado, de noche o de día,
o como más gusto le diere.
Estábale mirando Cardenio muy atentamente, al cual ya había venido el
accidente de su locura y no estaba para proseguir su historia; ni tampoco
don Quijote se la oyera, según le había disgustado lo que de Madásima le
había oído. ¡Estraño caso; que así volvió por ella como si verdaderamente
fuera su verdadera y natural señora: tal le tenían sus descomulgados
libros! Digo, pues, que, como ya Cardenio estaba loco y se oyó tratar de
mentís y de bellaco, con otros denuestos semejantes, parecióle mal la
burla, y alzó un guijarro que halló junto a sí, y dio con él en los pechos
tal golpe a don Quijote que le hizo caer de espaldas. Sancho Panza, que de
tal modo vio parar a su señor, arremetió al loco con el puño cerrado; y el
Roto le recibió de tal suerte que con una puñada dio con él a sus pies, y
luego se subió sobre él y le brumó las costillas muy a su sabor. El
cabrero, que le quiso defender, corrió el mesmo peligro. Y, después que los
tuvo a todos rendidos y molidos, los dejó y se fue, con gentil sosiego, a
emboscarse en la montaña.
Levantóse Sancho, y, con la rabia que tenía de verse aporreado tan sin
merecerlo, acudió a tomar la venganza del cabrero, diciéndole que él tenía
la culpa de no haberles avisado que a aquel hombre le tomaba a tiempos la
locura; que, si esto supieran, hubieran estado sobre aviso para poderse
guardar. Respondió el cabrero que ya lo había dicho, y que si él no lo
había oído, que no era suya la culpa. Replicó Sancho Panza, y tornó a
replicar el cabrero, y fue el fin de las réplicas asirse de las barbas y
darse tales puñadas que, si don Quijote no los pusiera en paz, se hicieran
pedazos. Decía Sancho, asido con el cabrero:
— Déjeme vuestra merced, señor Caballero de la Triste Figura, que en éste,
que es villano como yo y no está armado caballero, bien puedo a mi salvo
satisfacerme del agravio que me ha hecho, peleando con él mano a mano, como
hombre honrado.
— Así es —dijo don Quijote—, pero yo sé que él no tiene ninguna culpa de lo
sucedido.
Con esto los apaciguó, y don Quijote volvió a preguntar al cabrero si sería
posible hallar a Cardenio, porque quedaba con grandísimo deseo de saber el
fin de su historia. Díjole el cabrero lo que primero le había dicho, que
era no saber de cierto su manida; pero que, si anduviese mucho por aquellos
contornos, no dejaría de hallarle, o cuerdo o loco.
Capítulo XXV. Que trata de las estrañas cosas que en Sierra Morena
sucedieron al valiente caballero de la Mancha, y de la imitación que hizo a
la penitencia de Beltenebros
Despidióse del cabrero don Quijote, y, subiendo otra vez sobre Rocinante,
mandó a Sancho que le siguiese, el cual lo hizo, con su jumento, de muy
mala gana. Íbanse poco a poco entrando en lo más áspero de la montaña, y
Sancho iba muerto por razonar con su amo, y deseaba que él comenzase la
plática, por no contravenir a lo que le tenía mandado; mas, no pudiendo
sufrir tanto silencio, le dijo:
— Señor don Quijote, vuestra merced me eche su bendición y me dé licencia;
que desde aquí me quiero volver a mi casa, y a mi mujer y a mis hijos, con
los cuales, por lo menos, hablaré y departiré todo lo que quisiere; porque
querer vuestra merced que vaya con él por estas soledades, de día y de
noche, y que no le hable cuando me diere gusto es enterrarme en vida. Si ya
quisiera la suerte que los animales hablaran, como hablaban en tiempos de
Guisopete, fuera menos mal, porque departiera yo con mi jumento lo que me
viniera en gana, y con esto pasara mi mala ventura; que es recia cosa, y
que no se puede llevar en paciencia, andar buscando aventuras toda la vida
y no hallar sino coces y manteamientos, ladrillazos y puñadas, y, con todo
esto, nos hemos de coser la boca, sin osar decir lo que el hombre tiene en
su corazón, como si fuera mudo.
— Ya te entiendo, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—: tú mueres porque te alce
el entredicho que te tengo puesto en la lengua. Dale por alzado y di lo que
quisieres, con condición que no ha de durar este alzamiento más de en
cuanto anduviéremos por estas sierras.
— Sea ansí —dijo Sancho—: hable yo ahora, que después Dios sabe lo que será;
y, comenzando a gozar de ese salvoconduto, digo que ¿qué le iba a vuestra
merced en volver tanto por aquella reina Magimasa, o como se llama? O, ¿qué
hacía al caso que aquel abad fuese su amigo o no? Que, si vuestra merced
pasara con ello, pues no era su juez, bien creo yo que el loco pasara
adelante con su historia, y se hubieran ahorrado el golpe del guijarro, y
las coces, y aun más de seis torniscones.
— A fe, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que si tú supieras, como yo lo sé,
cuán honrada y cuán principal señora era la reina Madásima, yo sé que
dijeras que tuve mucha paciencia, pues no quebré la boca por donde tales
blasfemias salieron; porque es muy gran blasfemia decir ni pensar que una
reina esté amancebada con un cirujano. La verdad del cuento es que aquel
maestro Elisabat, que el loco dijo, fue un hombre muy prudente y de muy
sanos consejos, y sirvió de ayo y de médico a la reina; pero pensar que
ella era su amiga es disparate digno de muy gran castigo. Y, porque veas
que Cardenio no supo lo que dijo, has de advertir que cuando lo dijo ya
estaba sin juicio.
— Eso digo yo —dijo Sancho—: que no había para qué hacer cuenta de las
palabras de un loco, porque si la buena suerte no ayudara a vuestra merced
y encaminara el guijarro a la cabeza, como le encaminó al pecho, buenos
quedáramos por haber vuelto por aquella mi señora, que Dios cohonda. Pues,
¡montas que no se librara Cardenio por loco!
— Contra cuerdos y contra locos está obligado cualquier caballero andante a
volver por la honra de las mujeres, cualesquiera que sean, cuanto más por
las reinas de tan alta guisa y pro como fue la reina Madásima, a quien yo
tengo particular afición por sus buenas partes; porque, fuera de haber sido
fermosa, además fue muy prudente y muy sufrida en sus calamidades, que las
tuvo muchas; y los consejos y compañía del maestro Elisabat le fue y le
fueron de mucho provecho y alivio para poder llevar sus trabajos con
prudencia y paciencia. Y de aquí tomó ocasión el vulgo ignorante y mal
intencionado de decir y pensar que ella era su manceba; y mienten, digo
otra vez, y mentirán otras docientas, todos los que tal pensaren y dijeren.
— Ni yo lo digo ni lo pienso —respondió Sancho—: allá se lo hayan; con su
pan se lo coman. Si fueron amancebados, o no, a Dios habrán dado la cuenta.
De mis viñas vengo, no sé nada; no soy amigo de saber vidas ajenas; que el
que compra y miente, en su bolsa lo siente. Cuanto más, que desnudo nací,
desnudo me hallo: ni pierdo ni gano; mas que lo fuesen, ¿qué me va a mí? Y
muchos piensan que hay tocinos y no hay estacas. Mas, ¿quién puede poner
puertas al campo? Cuanto más, que de Dios dijeron.
— ¡Válame Dios —dijo don Quijote—, y qué de necedades vas, Sancho,
ensartando! ¿Qué va de lo que tratamos a los refranes que enhilas? Por tu
vida, Sancho, que calles; y de aquí adelante, entremétete en espolear a tu
asno, y deja de hacello en lo que no te importa. Y entiende con todos tus
cinco sentidos que todo cuanto yo he hecho, hago e hiciere, va muy puesto
en razón y muy conforme a las reglas de caballería, que las sé mejor que
cuantos caballeros las profesaron en el mundo.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, y ¿es buena regla de caballería que andemos
perdidos por estas montañas, sin senda ni camino, buscando a un loco, el
cual, después de hallado, quizá le vendrá en voluntad de acabar lo que dejó
comenzado, no de su cuento, sino de la cabeza de vuestra merced y de mis
costillas, acabándonoslas de romper de todo punto?
— Calla, te digo otra vez, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—; porque te hago saber
que no sólo me trae por estas partes el deseo de hallar al loco, cuanto el
que tengo de hacer en ellas una hazaña con que he de ganar perpetuo nombre
y fama en todo lo descubierto de la tierra; y será tal, que he de echar con
ella el sello a todo aquello que puede hacer perfecto y famoso a un andante
caballero.
— Y ¿es de muy gran peligro esa hazaña? —preguntó Sancho Panza.
— No —respondió el de la Triste Figura—, puesto que de tal manera podía
correr el dado, que echásemos azar en lugar de encuentro; pero todo ha de
estar en tu diligencia.
— ¿En mi diligencia? —dijo Sancho.
— Sí —dijo don Quijote—, porque si vuelves presto de adonde pienso enviarte,
presto se acabará mi pena y presto comenzará mi gloria. Y, porque no es
bien que te tenga más suspenso, esperando en lo que han de parar mis
razones, quiero, Sancho, que sepas que el famoso Amadís de Gaula fue uno de
los más perfectos caballeros andantes. No he dicho bien fue uno: fue el
solo, el primero, el único, el señor de todos cuantos hubo en su tiempo en
el mundo. Mal año y mal mes para don Belianís y para todos aquellos que
dijeren que se le igualó en algo, porque se engañan, juro cierto. Digo
asimismo que, cuando algún pintor quiere salir famoso en su arte, procura
imitar los originales de los más únicos pintores que sabe; y esta mesma
regla corre por todos los más oficios o ejercicios de cuenta que sirven
para adorno de las repúblicas. Y así lo ha de hacer y hace el que quiere
alcanzar nombre de prudente y sufrido, imitando a Ulises, en cuya persona y
trabajos nos pinta Homero un retrato vivo de prudencia y de sufrimiento;
como también nos mostró Virgilio, en persona de Eneas, el valor de un hijo
piadoso y la sagacidad de un valiente y entendido capitán, no pintándolo ni
descubriéndolo como ellos fueron, sino como habían de ser, para quedar
ejemplo a los venideros hombres de sus virtudes. Desta mesma suerte, Amadís
fue el norte, el lucero, el sol de los valientes y enamorados caballeros, a
quien debemos de imitar todos aquellos que debajo de la bandera de amor y
de la caballería militamos. Siendo, pues, esto ansí, como lo es, hallo yo,
Sancho amigo, que el caballero andante que más le imitare estará más cerca
de alcanzar la perfeción de la caballería. Y una de las cosas en que más
este caballero mostró su prudencia, valor, valentía, sufrimiento, firmeza y
amor, fue cuando se retiró, desdeñado de la señora Oriana, a hacer
penitencia en la Peña Pobre, mudado su nombre en el de Beltenebros, nombre,
por cierto, significativo y proprio para la vida que él de su voluntad
había escogido. Ansí que, me es a mí más fácil imitarle en esto que no en
hender gigantes, descabezar serpientes, matar endriagos, desbaratar
ejércitos, fracasar armadas y deshacer encantamentos. Y, pues estos lugares
son tan acomodados para semejantes efectos, no hay para qué se deje pasar
la ocasión, que ahora con tanta comodidad me ofrece sus guedejas.
— En efecto —dijo Sancho—, ¿qué es lo que vuestra merced quiere hacer en
este tan remoto lugar?
— ¿Ya no te he dicho —respondió don Quijote— que quiero imitar a Amadís,
haciendo aquí del desesperado, del sandio y del furioso, por imitar
juntamente al valiente don Roldán, cuando halló en una fuente las señales
de que Angélica la Bella había cometido vileza con Medoro, de cuya
pesadumbre se volvió loco y arrancó los árboles, enturbió las aguas de las
claras fuentes, mató pastores, destruyó ganados, abrasó chozas, derribó
casas, arrastró yeguas y hizo otras cien mil insolencias, dignas de eterno
nombre y escritura? Y, puesto que yo no pienso imitar a Roldán, o Orlando,
o Rotolando (que todos estos tres nombres tenía), parte por parte en todas
las locuras que hizo, dijo y pensó, haré el bosquejo, como mejor pudiere,
en las que me pareciere ser más esenciales. Y podrá ser que viniese a
contentarme con sola la imitación de Amadís, que sin hacer locuras de daño,
sino de lloros y sentimientos, alcanzó tanta fama como el que más.
— Paréceme a mí —dijo Sancho— que los caballeros que lo tal ficieron fueron
provocados y tuvieron causa para hacer esas necedades y penitencias, pero
vuestra merced, ¿qué causa tiene para volverse loco? ¿Qué dama le ha
desdeñado, o qué señales ha hallado que le den a entender que la señora
Dulcinea del Toboso ha hecho alguna niñería con moro o cristiano?
— Ahí esta el punto —respondió don Quijote— y ésa es la fineza de mi
negocio; que volverse loco un caballero andante con causa, ni grado ni
gracias: el toque está desatinar sin ocasión y dar a entender a mi dama que
si en seco hago esto, ¿qué hiciera en mojado? Cuanto más, que harta ocasión
tengo en la larga ausencia que he hecho de la siempre señora mía Dulcinea
del Toboso; que, como ya oíste decir a aquel pastor de marras, Ambrosio:
quien está ausente todos los males tiene y teme. Así que, Sancho amigo, no
gastes tiempo en aconsejarme que deje tan rara, tan felice y tan no vista
imitación. Loco soy, loco he de ser hasta tanto que tú vuelvas con la
respuesta de una carta que contigo pienso enviar a mi señora Dulcinea; y si
fuere tal cual a mi fe se le debe, acabarse ha mi sandez y mi penitencia; y
si fuere al contrario, seré loco de veras, y, siéndolo, no sentiré nada.
Ansí que, de cualquiera manera que responda, saldré del conflito y trabajo
en que me dejares, gozando el bien que me trujeres, por cuerdo, o no
sintiendo el mal que me aportares, por loco. Pero dime, Sancho, ¿traes bien
guardado el yelmo de Mambrino?; que ya vi que le alzaste del suelo cuando
aquel desagradecido le quiso hacer pedazos. Pero no pudo, donde se puede
echar de ver la fineza de su temple.
A lo cual respondió Sancho:
— Vive Dios, señor Caballero de la Triste Figura, que no puedo sufrir ni
llevar en paciencia algunas cosas que vuestra merced dice, y que por ellas
vengo a imaginar que todo cuanto me dice de caballerías y de alcanzar
reinos e imperios, de dar ínsulas y de hacer otras mercedes y grandezas,
como es uso de caballeros andantes, que todo debe de ser cosa de viento y
mentira, y todo pastraña, o patraña, o como lo llamáremos. Porque quien
oyere decir a vuestra merced que una bacía de barbero es el yelmo de
Mambrino, y que no salga de este error en más de cuatro días, ¿qué ha de
pensar, sino que quien tal dice y afirma debe de tener güero el juicio? La
bacía yo la llevo en el costal, toda abollada, y llévola para aderezarla en
mi casa y hacerme la barba en ella, si Dios me diere tanta gracia que algún
día me vea con mi mujer y hijos.
— Mira, Sancho, por el mismo que denantes juraste, te juro —dijo don
Quijote— que tienes el más corto entendimiento que tiene ni tuvo escudero
en el mundo. ¿Que es posible que en cuanto ha que andas conmigo no has
echado de ver que todas las cosas de los caballeros andantes parecen
quimeras, necedades y desatinos, y que son todas hechas al revés? Y no
porque sea ello ansí, sino porque andan entre nosotros siempre una caterva
de encantadores que todas nuestras cosas mudan y truecan y les vuelven
según su gusto, y según tienen la gana de favorecernos o destruirnos; y
así, eso que a ti te parece bacía de barbero, me parece a mí el yelmo de
Mambrino, y a otro le parecerá otra cosa. Y fue rara providencia del sabio
que es de mi parte hacer que parezca bacía a todos lo que real y
verdaderamente es yelmo de Mambrino, a causa que, siendo él de tanta
estima, todo el mundo me perseguirá por quitármele; pero, como ven que no
es más de un bacín de barbero, no se curan de procuralle, como se mostró
bien en el que quiso rompelle y le dejó en el suelo sin llevarle; que a fe
que si le conociera, que nunca él le dejara. Guárdale, amigo, que por ahora
no le he menester; que antes me tengo de quitar todas estas armas y quedar
desnudo como cuando nací, si es que me da en voluntad de seguir en mi
penitencia más a Roldán que a Amadís.
Llegaron, en estas pláticas, al pie de una alta montaña que, casi como
peñón tajado, estaba sola entre otras muchas que la rodeaban. Corría por su
falda un manso arroyuelo, y hacíase por toda su redondez un prado tan verde
y vicioso, que daba contento a los ojos que le miraban. Había por allí
muchos árboles silvestres y algunas plantas y flores, que hacían el lugar
apacible. Este sitio escogió el Caballero de la Triste Figura para hacer su
penitencia; y así, en viéndole, comenzó a decir en voz alta, como si
estuviera sin juicio:
— Éste es el lugar, ¡oh cielos!, que diputo y escojo para llorar la
desventura en que vosotros mesmos me habéis puesto. Éste es el sitio donde
el humor de mis ojos acrecentará las aguas deste pequeño arroyo, y mis
continos y profundos sospiros moverán a la contina las hojas destos
montaraces árboles, en testimonio y señal de la pena que mi asendereado
corazón padece. ¡Oh vosotros, quienquiera que seáis, rústicos dioses que en
este inhabitable lugar tenéis vuestra morada, oíd las quejas deste
desdichado amante, a quien una luenga ausencia y unos imaginados celos han
traído a lamentarse entre estas asperezas, y a quejarse de la dura
condición de aquella ingrata y bella, término y fin de toda humana
hermosura! ¡Oh vosotras, napeas y dríadas, que tenéis por costumbre de
habitar en las espesuras de los montes, así los ligeros y lascivos sátiros,
de quien sois, aunque en vano, amadas, no perturben jamás vuestro dulce
sosiego, que me ayudéis a lamentar mi desventura, o, a lo menos, no os
canséis de oílla! ¡Oh Dulcinea del Toboso, día de mi noche, gloria de mi
pena, norte de mis caminos, estrella de mi ventura, así el cielo te la dé
buena en cuanto acertares a pedirle, que consideres el lugar y el estado a
que tu ausencia me ha conducido, y que con buen término correspondas al que
a mi fe se le debe! ¡Oh solitarios árboles, que desde hoy en adelante
habéis de hacer compañía a mi soledad, dad indicio, con el blando
movimiento de vuestras ramas, que no os desagrade mi presencia! ¡Oh tú,
escudero mío, agradable compañero en más prósperos y adversos sucesos, toma
bien en la memoria lo que aquí me verás hacer, para que lo cuentes y
recetes a la causa total de todo ello!
Y, diciendo esto, se apeó de Rocinante, y en un momento le quitó el freno y
la silla; y, dándole una palmada en las ancas, le dijo:
— Libertad te da el que sin ella queda, ¡oh caballo tan estremado por tus
obras cuan desdichado por tu suerte! Vete por do quisieres, que en la
frente llevas escrito que no te igualó en ligereza el Hipogrifo de Astolfo,
ni el nombrado Frontino, que tan caro le costó a Bradamante.
Viendo esto Sancho, dijo:
— Bien haya quien nos quitó ahora del trabajo de desenalbardar al rucio; que
a fe que no faltaran palmadicas que dalle, ni cosas que decille en su
alabanza; pero si él aquí estuviera, no consintiera yo que nadie le
desalbardara, pues no había para qué, que a él no le tocaban las generales
de enamorado ni de desesperado, pues no lo estaba su amo, que era yo,
cuando Dios quería. Y en verdad, señor Caballero de la Triste Figura, que
si es que mi partida y su locura de vuestra merced va de veras, que será
bien tornar a ensillar a Rocinante, para que supla la falta del rucio,
porque será ahorrar tiempo a mi ida y vuelta; que si la hago a pie, no sé
cuándo llegaré ni cuándo volveré, porque, en resolución, soy mal caminante.
— Digo, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que sea como tú quisieres, que no me
parece mal tu designio; y digo que de aquí a tres días te partirás, porque
quiero que en este tiempo veas lo que por ella hago y digo, para que se lo
digas.
— Pues, ¿qué más tengo de ver —dijo Sancho— que lo que he visto?
— ¡Bien estás en el cuento! —respondió don Quijote—. Ahora me falta rasgar
las vestiduras, esparcir las armas y darme de calabazadas por estas peñas,
con otras cosas deste jaez que te han de admirar.
— Por amor de Dios —dijo Sancho—, que mire vuestra merced cómo se da esas
calabazadas; que a tal peña podrá llegar, y en tal punto, que con la
primera se acabase la máquina desta penitencia; y sería yo de parecer que,
ya que vuestra merced le parece que son aquí necesarias calabazadas y que
no se puede hacer esta obra sin ellas, se contentase, pues todo esto es
fingido y cosa contrahecha y de burla, se contentase, digo, con dárselas en
el agua, o en alguna cosa blanda, como algodón; y déjeme a mí el cargo, que
yo diré a mi señora que vuestra merced se las daba en una punta de peña más
dura que la de un diamante.
— Yo agradezco tu buena intención, amigo Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, mas
quiérote hacer sabidor de que todas estas cosas que hago no son de burlas,
sino muy de veras; porque de otra manera, sería contravenir a las órdenes
de caballería, que nos mandan que no digamos mentira alguna, pena de
relasos, y el hacer una cosa por otra lo mesmo es que mentir. Ansí que, mis
calabazadas han de ser verdaderas, firmes y valederas, sin que lleven nada
del sofístico ni del fantástico. Y será necesario que me dejes algunas
hilas para curarme, pues que la ventura quiso que nos faltase el bálsamo
que perdimos.
— Más fue perder el asno —respondió Sancho—, pues se perdieron en él las
hilas y todo. Y ruégole a vuestra merced que no se acuerde más de aquel
maldito brebaje; que en sólo oírle mentar se me revuelve el alma, no que el
estómago. Y más le ruego: que haga cuenta que son ya pasados los tres días
que me ha dado de término para ver las locuras que hace, que ya las doy por
vistas y por pasadas en cosa juzgada, y diré maravillas a mi señora; y
escriba la carta y despácheme luego, porque tengo gran deseo de volver a
sacar a vuestra merced deste purgatorio donde le dejo.
— ¿Purgatorio le llamas, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote—. Mejor hicieras de
llamarle infierno, y aun peor, si hay otra cosa que lo sea.
— Quien ha infierno —respondió Sancho—, nula es retencio, según he oído
decir.
— No entiendo qué quiere decir retencio —dijo don Quijote.
— Retencio es —respondió Sancho— que quien está en el infierno nunca sale
dél, ni puede. Lo cual será al revés en vuestra merced, o a mí me andarán
mal los pies, si es que llevo espuelas para avivar a Rocinante; y póngame
yo una por una en el Toboso, y delante de mi señora Dulcinea, que yo le
diré tales cosas de las necedades y locuras, que todo es uno, que vuestra
merced ha hecho y queda haciendo, que la venga a poner más blanda que un
guante, aunque la halle más dura que un alcornoque; con cuya respuesta
dulce y melificada volveré por los aires, como brujo, y sacaré a vuestra
merced deste purgatorio, que parece infierno y no lo es, pues hay esperanza
de salir dél, la cual, como tengo dicho, no la tienen de salir los que
están en el infierno, ni creo que vuestra merced dirá otra cosa.
— Así es la verdad —dijo el de la Triste Figura—; pero, ¿qué haremos para
escribir la carta?
— Y la libranza pollinesca también —añadió Sancho.
— Todo irá inserto —dijo don Quijote—; y sería bueno, ya que no hay papel,
que la escribiésemos, como hacían los antiguos, en hojas de árboles, o en
unas tablitas de cera; aunque tan dificultoso será hallarse eso ahora como
el papel. Mas ya me ha venido a la memoria dónde será bien, y aun más que
bien, escribilla: que es en el librillo de memoria que fue de Cardenio; y
tú tendrás cuidado de hacerla trasladar en papel, de buena letra, en el
primer lugar que hallares, donde haya maestro de escuela de muchachos, o si
no, cualquiera sacristán te la trasladará; y no se la des a trasladar a
ningún escribano, que hacen letra procesada, que no la entenderá Satanás.
— Pues, ¿qué se ha de hacer de la firma? —dijo Sancho.
— Nunca las cartas de Amadís se firman —respondió don Quijote.
— Está bien —respondió Sancho—, pero la libranza forzosamente se ha de
firmar, y ésa, si se traslada, dirán que la firma es falsa y quedaréme sin
pollinos.
— La libranza irá en el mesmo librillo firmada; que, en viéndola, mi sobrina
no pondrá dificultad en cumplilla. Y, en lo que toca a la carta de amores,
pondrás por firma: "Vuestro hasta la muerte, el Caballero de la Triste
Figura". Y hará poco al caso que vaya de mano ajena, porque, a lo que yo me
sé acordar, Dulcinea no sabe escribir ni leer, y en toda su vida ha visto
letra mía ni carta mía, porque mis amores y los suyos han sido siempre
platónicos, sin estenderse a más que a un honesto mirar. Y aun esto tan de
cuando en cuando, que osaré jurar con verdad que en doce años que ha que la
quiero más que a la lumbre destos ojos que han de comer la tierra, no la he
visto cuatro veces; y aun podrá ser que destas cuatro veces no hubiese ella
echado de ver la una que la miraba: tal es el recato y encerramiento con
que sus padres, Lorenzo Corchuelo, y su madre, Aldonza Nogales, la han
criado.
— ¡Ta, ta! —dijo Sancho—. ¿Que la hija de Lorenzo Corchuelo es la señora
Dulcinea del Toboso, llamada por otro nombre Aldonza Lorenzo?
— Ésa es —dijo don Quijote—, y es la que merece ser señora de todo el
universo.
— Bien la conozco —dijo Sancho—, y sé decir que tira tan bien una barra como
el más forzudo zagal de todo el pueblo. ¡Vive el Dador, que es moza de
chapa, hecha y derecha y de pelo en pecho, y que puede sacar la barba del
lodo a cualquier caballero andante, o por andar, que la tuviere por señora!
¡Oh hideputa, qué rejo que tiene, y qué voz! Sé decir que se puso un día
encima del campanario del aldea a llamar unos zagales suyos que andaban en
un barbecho de su padre, y, aunque estaban de allí más de media legua, así
la oyeron como si estuvieran al pie de la torre. Y lo mejor que tiene es
que no es nada melindrosa, porque tiene mucho de cortesana: con todos se
burla y de todo hace mueca y donaire. Ahora digo, señor Caballero de la
Triste Figura, que no solamente puede y debe vuestra merced hacer locuras
por ella, sino que, con justo título, puede desesperarse y ahorcarse; que
nadie habrá que lo sepa que no diga que hizo demasiado de bien, puesto que
le lleve el diablo. Y querría ya verme en camino, sólo por vella; que ha
muchos días que no la veo, y debe de estar ya trocada, porque gasta mucho
la faz de las mujeres andar siempre al campo, al sol y al aire. Y confieso
a vuestra merced una verdad, señor don Quijote: que hasta aquí he estado en
una grande ignorancia; que pensaba bien y fielmente que la señora Dulcinea
debía de ser alguna princesa de quien vuestra merced estaba enamorado, o
alguna persona tal, que mereciese los ricos presentes que vuestra merced le
ha enviado: así el del vizcaíno como el de los galeotes, y otros muchos que
deben ser, según deben de ser muchas las vitorias que vuestra merced ha
ganado y ganó en el tiempo que yo aún no era su escudero. Pero, bien
considerado, ¿qué se le ha de dar a la señora Aldonza Lorenzo, digo, a la
señora Dulcinea del Toboso, de que se le vayan a hincar de rodillas delante
della los vencidos que vuestra merced le envía y ha de enviar? Porque
podría ser que, al tiempo que ellos llegasen, estuviese ella rastrillando
lino, o trillando en las eras, y ellos se corriesen de verla, y ella se
riese y enfadase del presente.
— Ya te tengo dicho antes de agora muchas veces, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—,
que eres muy grande hablador, y que, aunque de ingenio boto, muchas veces
despuntas de agudo. Mas, para que veas cuán necio eres tú y cuán discreto
soy yo, quiero que me oyas un breve cuento. «Has de saber que una viuda
hermosa, moza, libre y rica, y, sobre todo, desenfadada, se enamoró de un
mozo motilón, rollizo y de buen tomo. Alcanzólo a saber su mayor, y un día
dijo a la buena viuda, por vía de fraternal reprehensión: ''Maravillado
estoy, señora, y no sin mucha causa, de que una mujer tan principal, tan
hermosa y tan rica como vuestra merced, se haya enamorado de un hombre tan
soez, tan bajo y tan idiota como fulano, habiendo en esta casa tantos
maestros, tantos presentados y tantos teólogos, en quien vuestra merced
pudiera escoger como entre peras, y decir: "Éste quiero, aquéste no
quiero"''. Mas ella le respondió, con mucho donaire y desenvoltura:
''Vuestra merced, señor mío, está muy engañado, y piensa muy a lo antiguo
si piensa que yo he escogido mal en fulano, por idiota que le parece, pues,
para lo que yo le quiero, tanta filosofía sabe, y más, que Aristóteles''».
Así que, Sancho, por lo que yo quiero a Dulcinea del Toboso, tanto vale
como la más alta princesa de la tierra. Sí, que no todos los poetas que
alaban damas, debajo de un nombre que ellos a su albedrío les ponen, es
verdad que las tienen. ¿Piensas tú que las Amariles, las Filis, las
Silvias, las Dianas, las Galateas, las Alidas y otras tales de que los
libros, los romances, las tiendas de los barberos, los teatros de las
comedias, están llenos, fueron verdaderamente damas de carne y hueso, y de
aquéllos que las celebran y celebraron? No, por cierto, sino que las más se
las fingen, por dar subjeto a sus versos y porque los tengan por enamorados
y por hombres que tienen valor para serlo. Y así, bástame a mí pensar y
creer que la buena de Aldonza Lorenzo es hermosa y honesta; y en lo del
linaje importa poco, que no han de ir a hacer la información dél para darle
algún hábito, y yo me hago cuenta que es la más alta princesa del mundo.
Porque has de saber, Sancho, si no lo sabes, que dos cosas solas incitan a
amar más que otras, que son la mucha hermosura y la buena fama; y estas dos
cosas se hallan consumadamente en Dulcinea, porque en ser hermosa ninguna
le iguala, y en la buena fama, pocas le llegan. Y para concluir con todo,
yo imagino que todo lo que digo es así, sin que sobre ni falte nada; y
píntola en mi imaginación como la deseo, así en la belleza como en la
principalidad, y ni la llega Elena, ni la alcanza Lucrecia, ni otra alguna
de las famosas mujeres de las edades pretéritas, griega, bárbara o latina.
Y diga cada uno lo que quisiere; que si por esto fuere reprehendido de los
ignorantes, no seré castigado de los rigurosos.
— Digo que en todo tiene vuestra merced razón —respondió Sancho—, y que yo
soy un asno. Mas no sé yo para qué nombro asno en mi boca, pues no se ha de
mentar la soga en casa del ahorcado. Pero venga la carta, y a Dios, que me
mudo.
Sacó el libro de memoria don Quijote, y, apartándose a una parte, con mucho
sosiego comenzó a escribir la carta; y, en acabándola, llamó a Sancho y le
dijo que se la quería leer, porque la tomase de memoria, si acaso se le
perdiese por el camino, porque de su desdicha todo se podía temer. A lo
cual respondió Sancho:
— Escríbala vuestra merced dos o tres veces ahí en el libro y démele, que yo
le llevaré bien guardado, porque pensar que yo la he de tomar en la memoria
es disparate: que la tengo tan mala que muchas veces se me olvida cómo me
llamo. Pero, con todo eso, dígamela vuestra merced, que me holgaré mucho de
oílla, que debe de ir como de molde.
— Escucha, que así dice —dijo don Quijote:
Carta de don Quijote a Dulcinea del Toboso
Soberana y alta señora:
El ferido de punta de ausencia y el llagado de las telas del corazón,
dulcísima Dulcinea del Toboso, te envía la salud que él no tiene. Si tu
fermosura me desprecia, si tu valor no es en mi pro, si tus desdenes son en
mi afincamiento, maguer que yo sea asaz de sufrido, mal podré sostenerme en
esta cuita, que, además de ser fuerte, es muy duradera. Mi buen escudero
Sancho te dará entera relación, ¡oh bella ingrata, amada enemiga mía!, del
modo que por tu causa quedo. Si gustares de acorrerme, tuyo soy; y si no,
haz lo que te viniere en gusto; que, con acabar mi vida, habré satisfecho a
tu crueldad y a mi deseo.
Tuyo hasta la muerte,
El Caballero de la Triste Figura.
— Por vida de mi padre —dijo Sancho en oyendo la carta—, que es la más alta
cosa que jamás he oído. ¡Pesia a mí, y cómo que le dice vuestra merced ahí
todo cuanto quiere, y qué bien que encaja en la firma El Caballero de la
Triste Figura! Digo de verdad que es vuestra merced el mesmo diablo, y que
no haya cosa que no sepa.
— Todo es menester —respondió don Quijote— para el oficio que trayo.
— Ea, pues —dijo Sancho—, ponga vuestra merced en esotra vuelta la cédula de
los tres pollinos y fírmela con mucha claridad, porque la conozcan en
viéndola.
— Que me place —dijo don Quijote.
Y, habiéndola escrito,se la leyó; que decía ansí:
Mandará vuestra merced, por esta primera de pollinos, señora sobrina, dar a
Sancho Panza, mi escudero, tres de los cinco que dejé en casa y están a
cargo de vuestra merced. Los cuales tres pollinos se los mando librar y
pagar por otros tantos aquí recebidos de contado, que consta, y con su
carta de pago serán bien dados. Fecha en las entrañas de Sierra Morena, a
veinte y dos de agosto deste presente año.
— Buena está —dijo Sancho—; fírmela vuestra merced.
— No es menester firmarla —dijo don Quijote—, sino solamente poner mi
rúbrica, que es lo mesmo que firma, y para tres asnos, y aun para
trecientos, fuera bastante.
— Yo me confío de vuestra merced —respondió Sancho—. Déjeme, iré a ensillar
a Rocinante, y aparéjese vuestra merced a echarme su bendición, que luego
pienso partirme, sin ver las sandeces que vuestra merced ha de hacer, que
yo diré que le vi hacer tantas que no quiera más.
— Por lo menos quiero, Sancho, y porque es menester ansí, quiero, digo, que
me veas en cueros, y hacer una o dos docenas de locuras, que las haré en
menos de media hora, porque, habiéndolas tú visto por tus ojos, puedas
jurar a tu salvo en las demás que quisieres añadir; y asegúrote que no
dirás tú tantas cuantas yo pienso hacer.
— Por amor de Dios, señor mío, que no vea yo en cueros a vuestra merced, que
me dará mucha lástima y no podré dejar de llorar; y tengo tal la cabeza,
del llanto que anoche hice por el rucio, que no estoy para meterme en
nuevos lloros; y si es que vuestra merced gusta de que yo vea algunas
locuras, hágalas vestido, breves y las que le vinieren más a cuento. Cuanto
más, que para mí no era menester nada deso, y, como ya tengo dicho, fuera
ahorrar el camino de mi vuelta, que ha de ser con las nuevas que vuestra
merced desea y merece. Y si no, aparéjese la señora Dulcinea; que si no
responde como es razón, voto hago solene a quien puedo que le tengo de
sacar la buena respuesta del estómago a coces y a bofetones. Porque, ¿dónde
se ha de sufrir que un caballero andante, tan famoso como vuestra merced,
se vuelva loco, sin qué ni para qué, por una...? No me lo haga decir la
señora, porque por Dios que despotrique y lo eche todo a doce, aunque nunca
se venda. ¡Bonico soy yo para eso! ¡Mal me conoce! ¡Pues, a fe que si me
conociese, que me ayunase!
— A fe, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que, a lo que parece, que no estás tú más
cuerdo que yo.
— No estoy tan loco —respondió Sancho—, mas estoy más colérico. Pero,
dejando esto aparte, ¿qué es lo que ha de comer vuestra merced en tanto que
yo vuelvo? ¿Ha de salir al camino, como Cardenio, a quitárselo a los
pastores?
— No te dé pena ese cuidado —respondió don Quijote—, porque, aunque tuviera,
no comiera otra cosa que las yerbas y frutos que este prado y estos árboles
me dieren, que la fineza de mi negocio está en no comer y en hacer otras
asperezas equivalentes.
— A Dios, pues. Pero, ¿sabe vuestra merced qué temo? Que no tengo de acertar
a volver a este lugar donde agora le dejo, según está de escondido.
— Toma bien las señas, que yo procuraré no apartarme destos contornos —dijo
don Quijote—, y aun tendré cuidado de subirme por estos más altos riscos,
por ver si te descubro cuando vuelvas. Cuanto más, que lo más acertado
será, para que no me yerres y te pierdas, que cortes algunas retamas de las
muchas que por aquí hay y las vayas poniendo de trecho a trecho, hasta
salir a lo raso, las cuales te servirán de mojones y señales para que me
halles cuando vuelvas, a imitación del hilo del laberinto de Teseo.
— Así lo haré —respondió Sancho Panza.
Y, cortando algunos, pidió la bendición a su señor, y, no sin muchas
lágrimas de entrambos, se despidió dél. Y, subiendo sobre Rocinante, a
quien don Quijote encomendó mucho, y que mirase por él como por su propria
persona, se puso en camino del llano, esparciendo de trecho a trecho los
ramos de la retama, como su amo se lo había aconsejado. Y así, se fue,
aunque todavía le importunaba don Quijote que le viese siquiera hacer dos
locuras. Mas no hubo andado cien pasos, cuando volvió y dijo:
— Digo, señor, que vuestra merced ha dicho muy bien: que, para que pueda
jurar sin cargo de conciencia que le he visto hacer locuras, será bien que
vea siquiera una, aunque bien grande la he visto en la quedada de vuestra
merced.
— ¿No te lo decía yo? —dijo don Quijote—. Espérate, Sancho, que en un credo
las haré.
Y, desnudándose con toda priesa las calzones, quedó en carnes y en pañales,
y luego, sin más ni más, dio dos zapatetas en el aire y dos tumbas, la
cabeza abajo y los pies en alto, descubriendo cosas que, por no verlas otra
vez, volvió Sancho la rienda a Rocinante y se dio por contento y satisfecho
de que podía jurar que su amo quedaba loco. Y así, le dejaremos ir su
camino, hasta la vuelta, que fue breve.
Capítulo XXVI. Donde se prosiguen las finezas que de enamorado hizo don
Quijote en Sierra Morena
Y, volviendo a contar lo que hizo el de la Triste Figura después que se vio
solo, dice la historia que, así como don Quijote acabó de dar las tumbas o
vueltas, de medio abajo desnudo y de medio arriba vestido, y que vio que
Sancho se había ido sin querer aguardar a ver más sandeces, se subió sobre
una punta de una alta peña y allí tornó a pensar lo que otras muchas veces
había pensado, sin haberse jamás resuelto en ello. Y era que cuál sería
mejor y le estaría más a cuento: imitar a Roldán en las locuras desaforadas
que hizo, o Amadís en las malencónicas. Y, hablando entre sí mesmo, decía:
— Si Roldán fue tan buen caballero y tan valiente como todos dicen, ¿qué
maravilla?, pues, al fin, era encantado y no le podía matar nadie si no era
metiéndole un alfiler de a blanca por la planta del pie, y él traía siempre
los zapatos con siete suelas de hierro. Aunque no le valieron tretas contra
Bernardo del Carpio, que se las entendió y le ahogó entre los brazos, en
Roncesvalles. Pero, dejando en él lo de la valentía a una parte, vengamos a
lo de perder el juicio, que es cierto que le perdió, por las señales que
halló en la fontana y por las nuevas que le dio el pastor de que Angélica
había dormido más de dos siestas con Medoro, un morillo de cabellos
enrizados y paje de Agramante; y si él entendió que esto era verdad y que
su dama le había cometido desaguisado, no hizo mucho en volverse loco. Pero
yo, ¿cómo puedo imitalle en las locuras, si no le imito en la ocasión
dellas? Porque mi Dulcinea del Toboso osaré yo jurar que no ha visto en
todos los días de su vida moro alguno, ansí como él es, en su mismo traje,
y que se está hoy como la madre que la parió; y haríale agravio manifiesto
si, imaginando otra cosa della, me volviese loco de aquel género de locura
de Roldán el furioso. Por otra parte, veo que Amadís de Gaula, sin perder
el juicio y sin hacer locuras, alcanzó tanta fama de enamorado como el que
más; porque lo que hizo, según su historia, no fue más de que, por verse
desdeñado de su señora Oriana, que le había mandado que no pareciese ante
su presencia hasta que fuese su voluntad, de que se retiró a la Peña Pobre
en compañía de un ermitaño, y allí se hartó de llorar y de encomendarse a
Dios, hasta que el cielo le acorrió, en medio de su mayor cuita y
necesidad. Y si esto es verdad, como lo es, ¿para qué quiero yo tomar
trabajo agora de desnudarme del todo, ni dar pesadumbre a estos árboles,
que no me han hecho mal alguno? Ni tengo para qué enturbiar el agua clara
destos arroyos, los cuales me han de dar de beber cuando tenga gana. Viva
la memoria de Amadís, y sea imitado de don Quijote de la Mancha en todo lo
que pudiere; del cual se dirá lo que del otro se dijo: que si no acabó
grandes cosas, murió por acometellas; y si yo no soy desechado ni desdeñado
de Dulcinea del Toboso, bástame, como ya he dicho, estar ausente della. Ea,
pues, manos a la obra: venid a mi memoria, cosas de Amadís, y enseñadme por
dónde tengo de comenzar a imitaros. Mas ya sé que lo más que él hizo fue
rezar y encomendarse a Dios; pero, ¿qué haré de rosario, que no le tengo?
En esto le vino al pensamiento cómo le haría, y fue que rasgó una gran tira
de las faldas de la camisa, que andaban colgando, y diole once ñudos, el
uno más gordo que los demás, y esto le sirvió de rosario el tiempo que allí
estuvo, donde rezó un millón de avemarías. Y lo que le fatigaba mucho era
no hallar por allí otro ermitaño que le confesase y con quien consolarse. Y
así, se entretenía paseándose por el pradecillo, escribiendo y grabando por
las cortezas de los árboles y por la menuda arena muchos versos, todos
acomodados a su tristeza, y algunos en alabanza de Dulcinea. Mas los que se
pudieron hallar enteros y que se pudiesen leer, después que a él allí le
hallaron, no fueron más que estos que aquí se siguen:
Árboles, yerbas y plantas
que en aqueste sitio estáis,
tan altos, verdes y tantas,
si de mi mal no os holgáis,
escuchad mis quejas santas.
Mi dolor no os alborote,
aunque más terrible sea,
pues, por pagaros escote,
aquí lloró don Quijote
ausencias de Dulcinea
del Toboso.
Es aquí el lugar adonde
el amador más leal
de su señora se esconde,
y ha venido a tanto mal
sin saber cómo o por dónde.
Tráele amor al estricote,
que es de muy mala ralea;
y así, hasta henchir un pipote,
aquí lloró don Quijote
ausencias de Dulcinea
del Toboso.
Buscando las aventuras
por entre las duras peñas,
maldiciendo entrañas duras,
que entre riscos y entre breñas
halla el triste desventuras,
hirióle amor con su azote,
no con su blanda correa;
y, en tocándole el cogote,
aquí lloró don Quijote
ausencias de Dulcinea
del Toboso.
No causó poca risa en los que hallaron los versos referidos el añadidura
del Toboso al nombre de Dulcinea, porque imaginaron que debió de imaginar
don Quijote que si, en nombrando a Dulcinea, no decía también del Toboso,
no se podría entender la copla; y así fue la verdad, como él después
confesó. Otros muchos escribió, pero, como se ha dicho, no se pudieron
sacar en limpio, ni enteros, más destas tres coplas. En esto, y en suspirar
y en llamar a los faunos y silvanos de aquellos bosques, a las ninfas de
los ríos, a la dolorosa y húmida Eco, que le respondiese, consolasen y
escuchasen, se entretenía, y en buscar algunas yerbas con que sustentarse
en tanto que Sancho volvía; que, si como tardó tres días, tardara tres
semanas, el Caballero de la Triste Figura quedara tan desfigurado que no le
conociera la madre que lo parió.
Y será bien dejalle, envuelto entre sus suspiros y versos, por contar lo
que le avino a Sancho Panza en su mandadería. Y fue que, en saliendo al
camino real, se puso en busca del Toboso, y otro día llegó a la venta donde
le había sucedido la desgracia de la manta; y no la hubo bien visto, cuando
le pareció que otra vez andaba en los aires, y no quiso entrar dentro,
aunque llegó a hora que lo pudiera y debiera hacer, por ser la del comer y
llevar en deseo de gustar algo caliente; que había grandes días que todo
era fiambre.
Esta necesidad le forzó a que llegase junto a la venta, todavía dudoso si
entraría o no. Y, estando en esto, salieron de la venta dos personas que
luego le conocieron; y dijo el uno al otro:
— Dígame, señor licenciado, aquel del caballo, ¿no es Sancho Panza, el que
dijo el ama de nuestro aventurero que había salido con su señor por
escudero?
— Sí es —dijo el licenciado—; y aquél es el caballo de nuestro don Quijote.
Y conociéronle tan bien como aquellos que eran el cura y el barbero de su
mismo lugar, y los que hicieron el escrutinio y acto general de los libros.
Los cuales, así como acabaron de conocer a Sancho Panza y a Rocinante,
deseosos de saber de don Quijote, se fueron a él; y el cura le llamó por su
nombre, diciéndole:
— Amigo Sancho Panza, ¿adónde queda vuestro amo?
Conociólos luego Sancho Panza, y determinó de encubrir el lugar y la suerte
donde y como su amo quedaba; y así, les respondió que su amo quedaba
ocupado en cierta parte y en cierta cosa que le era de mucha importancia,
la cual él no podía descubrir, por los ojos que en la cara tenía.
— No, no —dijo el barbero—, Sancho Panza; si vos no nos decís dónde queda,
imaginaremos, como ya imaginamos, que vos le habéis muerto y robado, pues
venís encima de su caballo. En verdad que nos habéis de dar el dueño del
rocín, o sobre eso, morena.
— No hay para qué conmigo amenazas, que yo no soy hombre que robo ni mato a
nadie: a cada uno mate su ventura, o Dios, que le hizo. Mi amo queda
haciendo penitencia en la mitad desta montaña, muy a su sabor.
Y luego, de corrida y sin parar, les contó de la suerte que quedaba, las
aventuras que le habían sucedido y cómo llevaba la carta a la señora
Dulcinea del Toboso, que era la hija de Lorenzo Corchuelo, de quien estaba
enamorado hasta los hígados.
Quedaron admirados los dos de lo que Sancho Panza les contaba; y, aunque ya
sabían la locura de don Quijote y el género della, siempre que la oían se
admiraban de nuevo. Pidiéronle a Sancho Panza que les enseñase la carta que
llevaba a la señora Dulcinea del Toboso. Él dijo que iba escrita en un
libro de memoria y que era orden de su señor que la hiciese trasladar en
papel en el primer lugar que llegase; a lo cual dijo el cura que se la
mostrase, que él la trasladaría de muy buena letra. Metió la mano en el
seno Sancho Panza, buscando el librillo, pero no le halló, ni le podía
hallar si le buscara hasta agora, porque se había quedado don Quijote con
él y no se le había dado, ni a él se le acordó de pedírsele.
Cuando Sancho vio que no hallaba el libro, fuésele parando mortal el
rostro; y, tornándose a tentar todo el cuerpo muy apriesa, tornó a echar de
ver que no le hallaba; y, sin más ni más, se echó entrambos puños a las
barbas y se arrancó la mitad de ellas, y luego, apriesa y sin cesar, se dio
media docena de puñadas en el rostro y en las narices, que se las bañó
todas en sangre. Visto lo cual por el cura y el barbero, le dijeron que qué
le había sucedido, que tan mal se paraba.
— ¿Qué me ha de suceder —respondió Sancho—, sino el haber perdido de una
mano a otra, en un estante, tres pollinos, que cada uno era como un
castillo?
— ¿Cómo es eso? —replicó el barbero.
— He perdido el libro de memoria —respondió Sancho—, donde venía carta para
Dulcinea y una cédula firmada de su señor, por la cual mandaba que su
sobrina me diese tres pollinos, de cuatro o cinco que estaban en casa.
Y, con esto, les contó la pérdida del rucio. Consolóle el cura, y díjole
que, en hallando a su señor, él le haría revalidar la manda y que tornase a
hacer la libranza en papel, como era uso y costumbre, porque las que se
hacían en libros de memoria jamás se acetaban ni cumplían.
Con esto se consoló Sancho, y dijo que, como aquello fuese ansí, que no le
daba mucha pena la pérdida de la carta de Dulcinea, porque él la sabía casi
de memoria, de la cual se podría trasladar donde y cuando quisiesen.
— Decildo, Sancho, pues —dijo el barbero—, que después la trasladaremos.
Paróse Sancho Panza a rascar la cabeza para traer a la memoria la carta, y
ya se ponía sobre un pie, y ya sobre otro; unas veces miraba al suelo,
otras al cielo; y, al cabo de haberse roído la mitad de la yema de un dedo,
teniendo suspensos a los que esperaban que ya la dijese, dijo al cabo de
grandísimo rato:
— Por Dios, señor licenciado, que los diablos lleven la cosa que de la carta
se me acuerda; aunque en el principio decía: «Alta y sobajada señora».
— No diría —dijo el barbero— sobajada, sino sobrehumana o soberana señora.
— Así es —dijo Sancho—. Luego, si mal no me acuerdo, proseguía..., si mal no
me acuerdo: «el llego y falto de sueño, y el ferido besa a vuestra merced
las manos, ingrata y muy desconocida hermosa», y no sé qué decía de salud y
de enfermedad que le enviaba, y por aquí iba escurriendo, hasta que acababa
en «Vuestro hasta la muerte, el Caballero de la Triste Figura».
No poco gustaron los dos de ver la buena memoria de Sancho Panza, y
alabáronsela mucho, y le pidieron que dijese la carta otras dos veces, para
que ellos, ansimesmo, la tomasen de memoria para trasladalla a su tiempo.
Tornóla a decir Sancho otras tres veces, y otras tantas volvió a decir
otros tres mil disparates. Tras esto, contó asimesmo las cosas de su amo,
pero no habló palabra acerca del manteamiento que le había sucedido en
aquella venta, en la cual rehusaba entrar. Dijo también como su señor, en
trayendo que le trujese buen despacho de la señora Dulcinea del Toboso, se
había de poner en camino a procurar cómo ser emperador, o, por lo menos,
monarca; que así lo tenían concertado entre los dos, y era cosa muy fácil
venir a serlo, según era el valor de su persona y la fuerza de su brazo; y
que, en siéndolo, le había de casar a él, porque ya sería viudo, que no
podía ser menos, y le había de dar por mujer a una doncella de la
emperatriz, heredera de un rico y grande estado de tierra firme, sin
ínsulos ni ínsulas, que ya no las quería.
Decía esto Sancho con tanto reposo, limpiándose de cuando en cuando las
narices, y con tan poco juicio, que los dos se admiraron de nuevo,
considerando cuán vehemente había sido la locura de don Quijote, pues había
llevado tras sí el juicio de aquel pobre hombre. No quisieron cansarse en
sacarle del error en que estaba, pareciéndoles que, pues no le dañaba nada
la conciencia, mejor era dejarle en él, y a ellos les sería de más gusto
oír sus necedades. Y así, le dijeron que rogase a Dios por la salud de su
señor, que cosa contingente y muy agible era venir, con el discurso del
tiempo, a ser emperador, como él decía, o, por lo menos, arzobispo, o otra
dignidad equivalente. A lo cual respondió Sancho:
— Señores, si la fortuna rodease las cosas de manera que a mi amo le viniese
en voluntad de no ser emperador, sino de ser arzobispo, querría yo saber
agora qué suelen dar los arzobispos andantes a sus escuderos.
— Suélenles dar —respondió el cura— algún beneficio, simple o curado, o
alguna sacristanía, que les vale mucho de renta rentada, amén del pie de
altar, que se suele estimar en otro tanto.
— Para eso será menester —replicó Sancho— que el escudero no sea casado y
que sepa ayudar a misa, por lo menos; y si esto es así, ¡desdichado de yo,
que soy casado y no sé la primera letra del ABC! ¿Qué será de mí si a mi
amo le da antojo de ser arzobispo, y no emperador, como es uso y costumbre
de los caballeros andantes?
— No tengáis pena, Sancho amigo —dijo el barbero—, que aquí rogaremos a
vuestro amo y se lo aconsejaremos, y aun se lo pondremos en caso de
conciencia, que sea emperador y no arzobispo, porque le será más fácil, a
causa de que él es más valiente que estudiante.
— Así me ha parecido a mí —respondió Sancho—, aunque sé decir que para todo
tiene habilidad. Lo que yo pienso hacer de mi parte es rogarle a Nuestro
Señor que le eche a aquellas partes donde él más se sirva y adonde a mí más
mercedes me haga.
— Vos lo decís como discreto —dijo el cura— y lo haréis como buen cristiano.
Mas lo que ahora se ha de hacer es dar orden como sacar a vuestro amo de
aquella inútil penitencia que decís que queda haciendo; y, para pensar el
modo que hemos de tener, y para comer, que ya es hora, será bien nos
entremos en esta venta.
Sancho dijo que entrasen ellos, que él esperaría allí fuera y que después
les diría la causa por que no entraba ni le convenía entrar en ella; mas
que les rogaba que le sacasen allí algo de comer que fuese cosa caliente,
y, ansimismo, cebada para Rocinante. Ellos se entraron y le dejaron, y, de
allí a poco, el barbero le sacó de comer. Después, habiendo bien pensado
entre los dos el modo que tendrían para conseguir lo que deseaban, vino el
cura en un pensamiento muy acomodado al gusto de don Quijote y para lo que
ellos querían. Y fue que dijo al barbero que lo que había pensado era que
él se vestiría en hábito de doncella andante, y que él procurase ponerse lo
mejor que pudiese como escudero, y que así irían adonde don Quijote estaba,
fingiendo ser ella una doncella afligida y menesterosa, y le pediría un
don, el cual él no podría dejársele de otorgar, como valeroso caballero
andante. Y que el don que le pensaba pedir era que se viniese con ella
donde ella le llevase, a desfacelle un agravio que un mal caballero le
tenía fecho; y que le suplicaba, ansimesmo, que no la mandase quitar su
antifaz, ni la demandase cosa de su facienda, fasta que la hubiese fecho
derecho de aquel mal caballero; y que creyese, sin duda, que don Quijote
vendría en todo cuanto le pidiese por este término; y que desta manera le
sacarían de allí y le llevarían a su lugar, donde procurarían ver si tenía
algún remedio su estraña locura.
Capítulo XXVII. De cómo salieron con su intención el cura y el barbero, con
otras cosas dignas de que se cuenten en esta grande historia
No le pareció mal al barbero la invención del cura, sino tan bien, que
luego la pusieron por obra. Pidiéronle a la ventera una saya y unas tocas,
dejándole en prendas una sotana nueva del cura. El barbero hizo una gran
barba de una cola rucia o roja de buey, donde el ventero tenía colgado el
peine. Preguntóles la ventera que para qué le pedían aquellas cosas. El
cura le contó en breves razones la locura de don Quijote, y cómo convenía
aquel disfraz para sacarle de la montaña, donde a la sazón estaba. Cayeron
luego el ventero y la ventera en que el loco era su huésped, el del
bálsamo, y el amo del manteado escudero, y contaron al cura todo lo que con
él les había pasado, sin callar lo que tanto callaba Sancho. En resolución,
la ventera vistió al cura de modo que no había más que ver: púsole una saya
de paño, llena de fajas de terciopelo negro de un palmo en ancho, todas
acuchilladas, y unos corpiños de terciopelo verde, guarnecidos con unos
ribetes de raso blanco, que se debieron de hacer, ellos y la saya, en
tiempo del rey Wamba. No consintió el cura que le tocasen, sino púsose en
la cabeza un birretillo de lienzo colchado que llevaba para dormir de
noche, y ciñóse por la frente una liga de tafetán negro, y con otra liga
hizo un antifaz, con que se cubrió muy bien las barbas y el rostro;
encasquetóse su sombrero, que era tan grande que le podía servir de
quitasol, y, cubriéndose su herreruelo, subió en su mula a mujeriegas, y el
barbero en la suya, con su barba que le llegaba a la cintura, entre roja y
blanca, como aquella que, como se ha dicho, era hecha de la cola de un buey
barroso.
Despidiéronse de todos, y de la buena de Maritornes, que prometió de rezar
un rosario, aunque pecadora, porque Dios les diese buen suceso en tan arduo
y tan cristiano negocio como era el que habían emprendido.
Mas, apenas hubo salido de la venta, cuando le vino al cura un pensamiento:
que hacía mal en haberse puesto de aquella manera, por ser cosa indecente
que un sacerdote se pusiese así, aunque le fuese mucho en ello; y,
diciéndoselo al barbero, le rogó que trocasen trajes, pues era más justo
que él fuese la doncella menesterosa, y que él haría el escudero, y que así
se profanaba menos su dignidad; y que si no lo quería hacer, determinaba de
no pasar adelante, aunque a don Quijote se le llevase el diablo.
En esto, llegó Sancho, y de ver a los dos en aquel traje no pudo tener la
risa. En efeto, el barbero vino en todo aquello que el cura quiso, y,
trocando la invención, el cura le fue informando el modo que había de tener
y las palabras que había de decir a don Quijote para moverle y forzarle a
que con él se viniese, y dejase la querencia del lugar que había escogido
para su vana penitencia. El barbero respondió que, sin que se le diese
lición, él lo pondría bien en su punto. No quiso vestirse por entonces,
hasta que estuviesen junto de donde don Quijote estaba; y así, dobló sus
vestidos, y el cura acomodó su barba, y siguieron su camino, guiándolos
Sancho Panza; el cual les fue contando lo que les aconteció con el loco que
hallaron en la sierra, encubriendo, empero, el hallazgo de la maleta y de
cuanto en ella venía; que, maguer que tonto, era un poco codicioso el
mancebo.
Otro día llegaron al lugar donde Sancho había dejado puestas las señales de
las ramas para acertar el lugar donde había dejado a su señor; y, en
reconociéndole, les dijo como aquélla era la entrada, y que bien se podían
vestir, si era que aquello hacía al caso para la libertad de su señor;
porque ellos le habían dicho antes que el ir de aquella suerte y vestirse
de aquel modo era toda la importancia para sacar a su amo de aquella mala
vida que había escogido, y que le encargaban mucho que no dijese a su amo
quien ellos eran, ni que los conocía; y que si le preguntase, como se lo
había de preguntar, si dio la carta a Dulcinea, dijese que sí, y que, por
no saber leer, le había respondido de palabra, diciéndole que le mandaba,
so pena de la su desgracia, que luego al momento se viniese a ver con ella,
que era cosa que le importaba mucho; porque con esto y con lo que ellos
pensaban decirle tenían por cosa cierta reducirle a mejor vida, y hacer con
él que luego se pusiese en camino para ir a ser emperador o monarca; que en
lo de ser arzobispo no había de qué temer.
Todo lo escuchó Sancho, y lo tomó muy bien en la memoria, y les agradeció
mucho la intención que tenían de aconsejar a su señor fuese emperador y no
arzobispo, porque él tenía para sí que, para hacer mercedes a sus
escuderos, más podían los emperadores que los arzobispos andantes. También
les dijo que sería bien que él fuese delante a buscarle y darle la
respuesta de su señora, que ya sería ella bastante a sacarle de aquel
lugar, sin que ellos se pusiesen en tanto trabajo. Parecióles bien lo que
Sancho Panza decía, y así, determinaron de aguardarle hasta que volviese
con las nuevas del hallazgo de su amo.
Entróse Sancho por aquellas quebradas de la sierra, dejando a los dos en
una por donde corría un pequeño y manso arroyo, a quien hacían sombra
agradable y fresca otras peñas y algunos árboles que por allí estaban. El
calor, y el día que allí llegaron, era de los del mes de agosto, que por
aquellas partes suele ser el ardor muy grande; la hora, las tres de la
tarde: todo lo cual hacía al sitio más agradable, y que convidase a que en
él esperasen la vuelta de Sancho, como lo hicieron.
Estando, pues, los dos allí, sosegados y a la sombra, llegó a sus oídos una
voz que, sin acompañarla son de algún otro instrumento, dulce y
regaladamente sonaba, de que no poco se admiraron, por parecerles que aquél
no era lugar donde pudiese haber quien tan bien cantase. Porque, aunque
suele decirse que por las selvas y campos se hallan pastores de voces
estremadas, más son encarecimientos de poetas que verdades; y más, cuando
advirtieron que lo que oían cantar eran versos, no de rústicos ganaderos,
sino de discretos cortesanos. Y confirmó esta verdad haber sido los versos
que oyeron éstos:
¿Quién menoscaba mis bienes?
Desdenes.
Y ¿quién aumenta mis duelos?
Los celos.
Y ¿quién prueba mi paciencia?
Ausencia.
De ese modo, en mi dolencia
ningún remedio se alcanza,
pues me matan la esperanza
desdenes, celos y ausencia.
¿Quién me causa este dolor?
Amor.
Y ¿quién mi gloria repugna?
Fortuna.
Y ¿quién consiente en mi duelo?
El cielo
De ese modo, yo recelo
morir deste mal estraño,
pues se aumentan en mi daño,
amor, fortuna y el cielo.
¿Quién mejorará mi suerte?
La muerte.
Y el bien de amor, ¿quién le alcanza?
Mudanza.
Y sus males, ¿quién los cura?
Locura.
De ese modo, no es cordura
querer curar la pasión
cuando los remedios son
muerte, mudanza y locura.
La hora, el tiempo, la soledad, la voz y la destreza del que cantaba causó
admiración y contento en los dos oyentes, los cuales se estuvieron quedos,
esperando si otra alguna cosa oían; pero, viendo que duraba algún tanto el
silencio, determinaron de salir a buscar el músico que con tan buena voz
cantaba. Y, queriéndolo poner en efeto, hizo la mesma voz que no se
moviesen, la cual llegó de nuevo a sus oídos, cantando este soneto:
Soneto
Santa amistad, que con ligeras alas,
tu apariencia quedándose en el suelo,
entre benditas almas, en el cielo,
subiste alegre a las impíreas salas,
desde allá, cuando quieres, nos señalas
la justa paz cubierta con un velo,
por quien a veces se trasluce el celo
de buenas obras que, a la fin, son malas.
Deja el cielo, ¡oh amistad!, o no permitas
que el engaño se vista tu librea,
con que destruye a la intención sincera;
que si tus apariencias no le quitas,
presto ha de verse el mundo en la pelea
de la discorde confusión primera.
El canto se acabó con un profundo suspiro, y los dos, con atención,
volvieron a esperar si más se cantaba; pero, viendo que la música se había
vuelto en sollozos y en lastimeros ayes, acordaron de saber quién era el
triste, tan estremado en la voz como doloroso en los gemidos; y no
anduvieron mucho, cuando, al volver de una punta de una peña, vieron a un
hombre del mismo talle y figura que Sancho Panza les había pintado cuando
les contó el cuento de Cardenio; el cual hombre, cuando los vio, sin
sobresaltarse, estuvo quedo, con la cabeza inclinada sobre el pecho a guisa
de hombre pensativo, sin alzar los ojos a mirarlos más de la vez primera,
cuando de improviso llegaron.
El cura, que era hombre bien hablado (como el que ya tenía noticia de su
desgracia, pues por las señas le había conocido), se llegó a él, y con
breves aunque muy discretas razones le rogó y persuadió que aquella tan
miserable vida dejase, porque allí no la perdiese, que era la desdicha
mayor de las desdichas. Estaba Cardenio entonces en su entero juicio, libre
de aquel furioso accidente que tan a menudo le sacaba de sí mismo; y así,
viendo a los dos en traje tan no usado de los que por aquellas soledades
andaban, no dejó de admirarse algún tanto, y más cuando oyó que le habían
hablado en su negocio como en cosa sabida —porque las razones que el cura
le dijo así lo dieron a entender—; y así, respondió desta manera:
— Bien veo yo, señores, quienquiera que seáis, que el cielo, que tiene
cuidado de socorrer a los buenos, y aun a los malos muchas veces, sin yo
merecerlo, me envía, en estos tan remotos y apartados lugares del trato
común de las gentes, algunas personas que, poniéndome delante de los ojos
con vivas y varias razones cuán sin ella ando en hacer la vida que hago,
han procurado sacarme désta a mejor parte; pero, como no saben que sé yo
que en saliendo deste daño he de caer en otro mayor, quizá me deben de
tener por hombre de flacos discursos, y aun, lo que peor sería, por de
ningún juicio. Y no sería maravilla que así fuese, porque a mí se me
trasluce que la fuerza de la imaginación de mis desgracias es tan intensa y
puede tanto en mi perdición que, sin que yo pueda ser parte a estobarlo,
vengo a quedar como piedra, falto de todo buen sentido y conocimiento; y
vengo a caer en la cuenta desta verdad, cuando algunos me dicen y muestran
señales de las cosas que he hecho en tanto que aquel terrible accidente me
señorea, y no sé más que dolerme en vano y maldecir sin provecho mi
ventura, y dar por disculpa de mis locuras el decir la causa dellas a
cuantos oírla quieren; porque, viendo los cuerdos cuál es la causa, no se
maravillarán de los efetos, y si no me dieren remedio, a lo menos no me
darán culpa, convirtiéndoseles el enojo de mi desenvoltura en lástima de
mis desgracias. Y si es que vosotros, señores, venís con la mesma intención
que otros han venido, antes que paséis adelante en vuestras discretas
persuasiones, os ruego que escuchéis el cuento, que no le tiene, de mis
desventuras; porque quizá, después de entendido, ahorraréis del trabajo que
tomaréis en consolar un mal que de todo consuelo es incapaz.
Los dos, que no deseaban otra cosa que saber de su mesma boca la causa de
su daño, le rogaron se la contase, ofreciéndole de no hacer otra cosa de la
que él quisiese, en su remedio o consuelo; y con esto, el triste caballero
comenzó su lastimera historia, casi por las mesmas palabras y pasos que la
había contado a don Quijote y al cabrero pocos días atrás, cuando, por
ocasión del maestro Elisabat y puntualidad de don Quijote en guardar el
decoro a la caballería, se quedó el cuento imperfeto, como la historia lo
deja contado. Pero ahora quiso la buena suerte que se detuvo el accidente
de la locura y le dio lugar de contarlo hasta el fin; y así, llegando al
paso del billete que había hallado don Fernando entre el libro de Amadís de
Gaula, dijo Cardenio que le tenía bien en la memoria, y que decía desta
manera:
«Luscinda a Cardenio
Cada día descubro en vos valores que me obligan y fuerzan a que en más os
estime; y así, si quisiéredes sacarme desta deuda sin ejecutarme en la
honra, lo podréis muy bien hacer. Padre tengo, que os conoce y que me
quiere bien, el cual, sin forzar mi voluntad, cumplirá la que será justo
que vos tengáis, si es que me estimáis como decís y como yo creo.
— »Por este billete me moví a pedir a Luscinda por esposa, como ya os he
contado, y éste fue por quien quedó Luscinda en la opinión de don Fernando
por una de las más discretas y avisadas mujeres de su tiempo; y este
billete fue el que le puso en deseo de destruirme, antes que el mío se
efetuase. Díjele yo a don Fernando en lo que reparaba el padre de Luscinda,
que era en que mi padre se la pidiese, lo cual yo no le osaba decir,
temeroso que no vendría en ello, no porque no tuviese bien conocida la
calidad, bondad, virtud y hermosura de Luscinda, y que tenía partes
bastantes para enoblecer cualquier otro linaje de España, sino porque yo
entendía dél que deseaba que no me casase tan presto, hasta ver lo que el
duque Ricardo hacía conmigo. En resolución, le dije que no me aventuraba a
decírselo a mi padre, así por aquel inconveniente como por otros muchos que
me acobardaban, sin saber cuáles eran, sino que me parecía que lo que yo
desease jamás había de tener efeto.
»A todo esto me respondió don Fernando que él se encargaba de hablar a mi
padre y hacer con él que hablase al de Luscinda. ¡Oh Mario ambicioso, oh
Catilina cruel, oh Sila facinoroso, oh Galalón embustero, oh Vellido
traidor, oh Julián vengativo, oh Judas codicioso! Traidor, cruel, vengativo
y embustero, ¿qué deservicios te había hecho este triste, que con tanta
llaneza te descubrió los secretos y contentos de su corazón? ¿Qué ofensa te
hice? ¿Qué palabras te dije, o qué consejos te di, que no fuesen todos
encaminados a acrecentar tu honra y tu provecho? Mas, ¿de qué me quejo?,
¡desventurado de mí!, pues es cosa cierta que cuando traen las desgracias
la corriente de las estrellas, como vienen de alto a bajo, despeñándose con
furor y con violencia, no hay fuerza en la tierra que las detenga, ni
industria humana que prevenirlas pueda. ¿Quién pudiera imaginar que don
Fernando, caballero ilustre, discreto, obligado de mis servicios, poderoso
para alcanzar lo que el deseo amoroso le pidiese dondequiera que le
ocupase, se había de enconar, como suele decirse, en tomarme a mí una sola
oveja, que aún no poseía? Pero quédense estas consideraciones aparte, como
inútiles y sin provecho, y añudemos el roto hilo de mi desdichada historia.
»Digo, pues, que, pareciéndole a don Fernando que mi presencia le era
inconveniente para poner en ejecución su falso y mal pensamiento, determinó
de enviarme a su hermano mayor, con ocasión de pedirle unos dineros para
pagar seis caballos, que de industria, y sólo para este efeto de que me
ausentase (para poder mejor salir con su dañado intento), el mesmo día que
se ofreció hablar a mi padre los compró, y quiso que yo viniese por el
dinero. ¿Pude yo prevenir esta traición? ¿Pude, por ventura, caer en
imaginarla? No, por cierto; antes, con grandísimo gusto, me ofrecí a partir
luego, contento de la buena compra hecha. Aquella noche hablé con Luscinda,
y le dije lo que con don Fernando quedaba concertado, y que tuviese firme
esperanza de que tendrían efeto nuestros buenos y justos deseos. Ella me
dijo, tan segura como yo de la traición de don Fernando, que procurase
volver presto, porque creía que no tardaría más la conclusión de nuestras
voluntades que tardase mi padre de hablar al suyo. No sé qué se fue, que,
en acabando de decirme esto, se le llenaron los ojos de lágrimas y un nudo
se le atravesó en la garganta, que no le dejaba hablar palabra de otras
muchas que me pareció que procuraba decirme.
»Quedé admirado deste nuevo accidente, hasta allí jamás en ella visto,
porque siempre nos hablábamos, las veces que la buena fortuna y mi
diligencia lo concedía, con todo regocijo y contento, sin mezclar en
nuestras pláticas lágrimas, suspiros, celos, sospechas o temores. Todo era
engrandecer yo mi ventura, por habérmela dado el cielo por señora:
exageraba su belleza, admirábame de su valor y entendimiento. Volvíame ella
el recambio, alabando en mí lo que, como enamorada, le parecía digno de
alabanza. Con esto, nos contábamos cien mil niñerías y acaecimientos de
nuestros vecinos y conocidos, y a lo que más se entendía mi desenvoltura
era a tomarle, casi por fuerza, una de sus bellas y blancas manos, y
llegarla a mi boca, según daba lugar la estrecheza de una baja reja que nos
dividía. Pero la noche que precedió al triste día de mi partida, ella
lloró, gimió y suspiró, y se fue, y me dejó lleno de confusión y
sobresalto, espantado de haber visto tan nuevas y tan tristes muestras de
dolor y sentimiento en Luscinda. Pero, por no destruir mis esperanzas, todo
lo atribuí a la fuerza del amor que me tenía y al dolor que suele causar la
ausencia en los que bien se quieren.
»En fin, yo me partí triste y pensativo, llena el alma de imaginaciones y
sospechas, sin saber lo que sospechaba ni imaginaba: claros indicios que me
mostraban el triste suceso y desventura que me estaba guardada. Llegué al
lugar donde era enviado. Di las cartas al hermano de don Fernando. Fui bien
recebido, pero no bien despachado, porque me mandó aguardar, bien a mi
disgusto, ocho días, y en parte donde el duque, su padre, no me viese,
porque su hermano le escribía que le enviase cierto dinero sin su
sabiduría. Y todo fue invención del falso don Fernando, pues no le faltaban
a su hermano dineros para despacharme luego. Orden y mandato fue éste que
me puso en condición de no obedecerle, por parecerme imposible sustentar
tantos días la vida en el ausencia de Luscinda, y más, habiéndola dejado
con la tristeza que os he contado; pero, con todo esto, obedecí, como buen
criado, aunque veía que había de ser a costa de mi salud.
»Pero, a los cuatro días que allí llegué, llegó un hombre en mi busca con
una carta, que me dio, que en el sobrescrito conocí ser de Luscinda, porque
la letra dél era suya. Abríla, temeroso y con sobresalto, creyendo que cosa
grande debía de ser la que la había movido a escribirme estando ausente,
pues presente pocas veces lo hacía. Preguntéle al hombre, antes de leerla,
quién se la había dado y el tiempo que había tardado en el camino. Díjome
que acaso, pasando por una calle de la ciudad a la hora de medio día, una
señora muy hermosa le llamó desde una ventana, los ojos llenos de lágrimas,
y que con mucha priesa le dijo: ''Hermano: si sois cristiano, como
parecéis, por amor de Dios os ruego que encaminéis luego luego esta carta
al lugar y a la persona que dice el sobrescrito, que todo es bien conocido,
y en ello haréis un gran servicio a nuestro Señor; y, para que no os falte
comodidad de poderlo hacer, tomad lo que va en este pañuelo''. ''Y,
diciendo esto, me arrojó por la ventana un pañuelo, donde venían atados
cien reales y esta sortija de oro que aquí traigo, con esa carta que os he
dado. Y luego, sin aguardar respuesta mía, se quitó de la ventana; aunque
primero vio cómo yo tomé la carta y el pañuelo, y, por señas, le dije que
haría lo que me mandaba. Y así, viéndome tan bien pagado del trabajo que
podía tomar en traérosla y conociendo por el sobrescrito que érades vos a
quien se enviaba, porque yo, señor, os conozco muy bien, y obligado
asimesmo de las lágrimas de aquella hermosa señora, determiné de no fiarme
de otra persona, sino venir yo mesmo a dárosla; y en diez y seis horas que
ha que se me dio, he hecho el camino, que sabéis que es de diez y ocho
leguas''.
»En tanto que el agradecido y nuevo correo esto me decía, estaba yo colgado
de sus palabras, temblándome las piernas de manera que apenas podía
sostenerme. En efeto, abrí la carta y vi que contenía estas razones:
La palabra que don Fernando os dio de hablar a vuestro padre para que
hablase al mío, la ha cumplido más en su gusto que en vuestro provecho.
Sabed, señor, que él me ha pedido por esposa, y mi padre, llevado de la
ventaja que él piensa que don Fernando os hace, ha venido en lo que quiere,
con tantas veras que de aquí a dos días se ha de hacer el desposorio, tan
secreto y tan a solas, que sólo han de ser testigos los cielos y alguna
gente de casa. Cual yo quedo, imaginaldo; si os cumple venir, veldo; y si
os quiero bien o no, el suceso deste negocio os lo dará a entender. A Dios
plega que ésta llegue a vuestras manos antes que la mía se vea en condición
de juntarse con la de quien tan mal sabe guardar la fe que promete.
»Éstas, en suma, fueron las razones que la carta contenía y las que me
hicieron poner luego en camino, sin esperar otra respuesta ni otros
dineros; que bien claro conocí entonces que no la compra de los caballos,
sino la de su gusto, había movido a don Fernando a enviarme a su hermano.
El enojo que contra don Fernando concebí, junto con el temor de perder la
prenda que con tantos años de servicios y deseos tenía granjeada, me
pusieron alas, pues, casi como en vuelo, otro día me puse en mi lugar, al
punto y hora que convenía para ir a hablar a Luscinda. Entré secreto, y
dejé una mula en que venía en casa del buen hombre que me había llevado la
carta; y quiso la suerte que entonces la tuviese tan buena que hallé a
Luscinda puesta a la reja, testigo de nuestros amores. Conocióme Luscinda
luego, y conocíla yo; mas no como debía ella conocerme y yo conocerla.
Pero, ¿quién hay en el mundo que se pueda alabar que ha penetrado y sabido
el confuso pensamiento y condición mudable de una mujer? Ninguno, por
cierto.
»Digo, pues, que, así como Luscinda me vio, me dijo: ''Cardenio, de boda
estoy vestida; ya me están aguardando en la sala don Fernando el traidor y
mi padre el codicioso, con otros testigos, que antes lo serán de mi muerte
que de mi desposorio. No te turbes, amigo, sino procura hallarte presente a
este sacrificio, el cual si no pudiere ser estorbado de mis razones, una
daga llevo escondida que podrá estorbar más determinadas fuerzas, dando fin
a mi vida y principio a que conozcas la voluntad que te he tenido y
tengo''. Yo le respondí turbado y apriesa, temeroso no me faltase lugar
para responderla: ''Hagan, señora, tus obras verdaderas tus palabras; que
si tú llevas daga para acreditarte, aquí llevo yo espada para defenderte
con ella o para matarme si la suerte nos fuere contraria''. No creo que
pudo oír todas estas razones, porque sentí que la llamaban apriesa, porque
el desposado aguardaba. Cerróse con esto la noche de mi tristeza, púsoseme
el sol de mi alegría: quedé sin luz en los ojos y sin discurso en el
entendimiento. No acertaba a entrar en su casa, ni podía moverme a parte
alguna; pero, considerando cuánto importaba mi presencia para lo que
suceder pudiese en aquel caso, me animé lo más que pude y entré en su casa.
Y, como ya sabía muy bien todas sus entradas y salidas, y más con el
alboroto que de secreto en ella andaba, nadie me echó de ver. Así que, sin
ser visto, tuve lugar de ponerme en el hueco que hacía una ventana de la
mesma sala, que con las puntas y remates de dos tapices se cubría, por
entre las cuales podía yo ver, sin ser visto, todo cuanto en la sala se
hacía.
»¿Quién pudiera decir ahora los sobresaltos que me dio el corazón mientras
allí estuve, los pensamientos que me ocurrieron, las consideraciones que
hice?, que fueron tantas y tales, que ni se pueden decir ni aun es bien que
se digan. Basta que sepáis que el desposado entró en la sala sin otro
adorno que los mesmos vestidos ordinarios que solía. Traía por padrino a un
primo hermano de Luscinda, y en toda la sala no había persona de fuera,
sino los criados de casa. De allí a un poco, salió de una recámara
Luscinda, acompañada de su madre y de dos doncellas suyas, tan bien
aderezada y compuesta como su calidad y hermosura merecían, y como quien
era la perfeción de la gala y bizarría cortesana. No me dio lugar mi
suspensión y arrobamiento para que mirase y notase en particular lo que
traía vestido; sólo pude advertir a las colores, que eran encarnado y
blanco, y en las vislumbres que las piedras y joyas del tocado y de todo el
vestido hacían, a todo lo cual se aventajaba la belleza singular de sus
hermosos y rubios cabellos; tales que, en competencia de las preciosas
piedras y de las luces de cuatro hachas que en la sala estaban, la suya con
más resplandor a los ojos ofrecían. ¡Oh memoria, enemiga mortal de mi
descanso! ¿De qué sirve representarme ahora la incomparable belleza de
aquella adorada enemiga mía? ¿No será mejor, cruel memoria, que me acuerdes
y representes lo que entonces hizo, para que, movido de tan manifiesto
agravio, procure, ya que no la venganza, a lo menos perder la vida?» No os
canséis, señores, de oír estas digresiones que hago; que no es mi pena de
aquellas que puedan ni deban contarse sucintamente y de paso, pues cada
circunstancia suya me parece a mí que es digna de un largo discurso.
A esto le respondió el cura que no sólo no se cansaban en oírle, sino que
les daba mucho gusto las menudencias que contaba, por ser tales, que
merecían no pasarse en silencio, y la mesma atención que lo principal del
cuento.
— «Digo, pues —prosiguió Cardenio—, que, estando todos en la sala, entró el
cura de la perroquia, y, tomando a los dos por la mano para hacer lo que en
tal acto se requiere, al decir: ''¿Queréis, señora Luscinda, al señor don
Fernando, que está presente, por vuestro legítimo esposo, como lo manda la
Santa Madre Iglesia?'', yo saqué toda la cabeza y cuello de entre los
tapices, y con atentísimos oídos y alma turbada me puse a escuchar lo que
Luscinda respondía, esperando de su respuesta la sentencia de mi muerte o
la confirmación de mi vida. ¡Oh, quién se atreviera a salir entonces,
diciendo a voces!: ''¡Ah Luscinda, Luscinda, mira lo que haces, considera
lo que me debes, mira que eres mía y que no puedes ser de otro! Advierte
que el decir tú sí y el acabárseme la vida ha de ser todo a un punto. ¡Ah
traidor don Fernando, robador de mi gloria, muerte de mi vida! ¿Qué
quieres? ¿Qué pretendes? Considera que no puedes cristianamente llegar al
fin de tus deseos, porque Luscinda es mi esposa y yo soy su marido''. ¡Ah,
loco de mí, ahora que estoy ausente y lejos del peligro, digo que había de
hacer lo que no hice! ¡Ahora que dejé robar mi cara prenda, maldigo al
robador, de quien pudiera vengarme si tuviera corazón para ello como le
tengo para quejarme! En fin, pues fui entonces cobarde y necio, no es mucho
que muera ahora corrido, arrepentido y loco.
»Estaba esperando el cura la respuesta de Luscinda, que se detuvo un buen
espacio en darla, y, cuando yo pensé que sacaba la daga para acreditarse, o
desataba la lengua para decir alguna verdad o desengaño que en mi provecho
redundase, oigo que dijo con voz desmayada y flaca: ''Sí quiero''; y lo
mesmo dijo don Fernando; y, dándole el anillo, quedaron en disoluble nudo
ligados. Llegó el desposado a abrazar a su esposa, y ella, poniéndose la
mano sobre el corazón, cayó desmayada en los brazos de su madre. Resta
ahora decir cuál quedé yo viendo, en el sí que había oído, burladas mis
esperanzas, falsas las palabras y promesas de Luscinda: imposibilitado de
cobrar en algún tiempo el bien que en aquel instante había perdido. Quedé
falto de consejo, desamparado, a mi parecer, de todo el cielo, hecho
enemigo de la tierra que me sustentaba, negándome el aire aliento para mis
suspiros y el agua humor para mis ojos; sólo el fuego se acrecentó de
manera que todo ardía de rabia y de celos.
»Alborotáronse todos con el desmayo de Luscinda, y, desabrochándole su
madre el pecho para que le diese el aire, se descubrió en él un papel
cerrado, que don Fernando tomó luego y se le puso a leer a la luz de una de
las hachas; y, en acabando de leerle, se sentó en una silla y se puso la
mano en la mejilla, con muestras de hombre muy pensativo, sin acudir a los
remedios que a su esposa se hacían para que del desmayo volviese. Yo,
viendo alborotada toda la gente de casa, me aventuré a salir, ora fuese
visto o no, con determinación que si me viesen, de hacer un desatino tal,
que todo el mundo viniera a entender la justa indignación de mi pecho en el
castigo del falso don Fernando, y aun en el mudable de la desmayada
traidora. Pero mi suerte, que para mayores males, si es posible que los
haya, me debe tener guardado, ordenó que en aquel punto me sobrase el
entendimiento que después acá me ha faltado; y así, sin querer tomar
venganza de mis mayores enemigos (que, por estar tan sin pensamiento mío,
fuera fácil tomarla), quise tomarla de mi mano y ejecutar en mí la pena que
ellos merecían; y aun quizá con más rigor del que con ellos se usara si
entonces les diera muerte, pues la que se recibe repentina presto acaba la
pena; mas la que se dilata con tormentos siempre mata, sin acabar la vida.
»En fin, yo salí de aquella casa y vine a la de aquél donde había dejado la
mula; hice que me la ensillase, sin despedirme dél subí en ella, y salí de
la ciudad, sin osar, como otro Lot, volver el rostro a miralla; y cuando me
vi en el campo solo, y que la escuridad de la noche me encubría y su
silencio convidaba a quejarme, sin respeto o miedo de ser escuchado ni
conocido, solté la voz y desaté la lengua en tantas maldiciones de Luscinda
y de don Fernando, como si con ellas satisficiera el agravio que me habían
hecho. Dile títulos de cruel, de ingrata, de falsa y desagradecida; pero,
sobre todos, de codiciosa, pues la riqueza de mi enemigo la había cerrado
los ojos de la voluntad, para quitármela a mí y entregarla a aquél con
quien más liberal y franca la fortuna se había mostrado; y, en mitad de la
fuga destas maldiciones y vituperios, la desculpaba, diciendo que no era
mucho que una doncella recogida en casa de sus padres, hecha y acostumbrada
siempre a obedecerlos, hubiese querido condecender con su gusto, pues le
daban por esposo a un caballero tan principal, tan rico y tan gentil hombre
que, a no querer recebirle, se podía pensar, o que no tenía juicio, o que
en otra parte tenía la voluntad: cosa que redundaba tan en perjuicio de su
buena opinión y fama. Luego volvía diciendo que, puesto que ella dijera que
yo era su esposo, vieran ellos que no había hecho en escogerme tan mala
elección, que no la disculparan, pues antes de ofrecérseles don Fernando no
pudieran ellos mesmos acertar a desear, si con razón midiesen su deseo,
otro mejor que yo para esposo de su hija; y que bien pudiera ella, antes de
ponerse en el trance forzoso y último de dar la mano, decir que ya yo le
había dado la mía; que yo viniera y concediera con todo cuanto ella
acertara a fingir en este caso.
»En fin, me resolví en que poco amor, poco juicio, mucha ambición y deseos
de grandezas hicieron que se olvidase de las palabras con que me había
engañado, entretenido y sustentado en mis firmes esperanzas y honestos
deseos. Con estas voces y con esta inquietud caminé lo que quedaba de
aquella noche, y di al amanecer en una entrada destas sierras, por las
cuales caminé otros tres días, sin senda ni camino alguno, hasta que vine a
parar a unos prados, que no sé a qué mano destas montañas caen, y allí
pregunté a unos ganaderos que hacia dónde era lo más áspero destas sierras.
Dijéronme que hacia esta parte. Luego me encaminé a ella, con intención de
acabar aquí la vida, y, en entrando por estas asperezas, del cansancio y de
la hambre se cayó mi mula muerta, o, lo que yo más creo, por desechar de sí
tan inútil carga como en mí llevaba. Yo quedé a pie, rendido de la
naturaleza, traspasado de hambre, sin tener, ni pensar buscar, quien me
socorriese.
»De aquella manera estuve no sé qué tiempo, tendido en el suelo, al cabo
del cual me levanté sin hambre, y hallé junto a mí a unos cabreros, que,
sin duda, debieron ser los que mi necesidad remediaron, porque ellos me
dijeron de la manera que me habían hallado, y cómo estaba diciendo tantos
disparates y desatinos, que daba indicios claros de haber perdido el
juicio; y yo he sentido en mí, después acá, que no todas veces le tengo
cabal, sino tan desmedrado y flaco que hago mil locuras, rasgándome los
vestidos, dando voces por estas soledades, maldiciendo mi ventura y
repitiendo en vano el nombre amado de mi enemiga, sin tener otro discurso
ni intento entonces que procurar acabar la vida voceando; y cuando en mí
vuelvo, me hallo tan cansado y molido, que apenas puedo moverme. Mi más
común habitación es en el hueco de un alcornoque, capaz de cubrir este
miserable cuerpo. Los vaqueros y cabreros que andan por estas montañas,
movidos de caridad, me sustentan, poniéndome el manjar por los caminos y
por las peñas por donde entienden que acaso podré pasar y hallarlo; y así,
aunque entonces me falte el juicio, la necesidad natural me da a conocer el
mantenimiento, y despierta en mí el deseo de apetecerlo y la voluntad de
tomarlo. Otras veces me dicen ellos, cuando me encuentran con juicio, que
yo salgo a los caminos y que se lo quito por fuerza, aunque me lo den de
grado, a los pastores que vienen con ello del lugar a las majadas.
»Desta manera paso mi miserable y estrema vida, hasta que el cielo sea
servido de conducirle a su último fin, o de ponerle en mi memoria, para que
no me acuerde de la hermosura y de la traición de Luscinda y del agravio de
don Fernando; que si esto él hace sin quitarme la vida, yo volveré a mejor
discurso mis pensamientos; donde no, no hay sino rogarle que absolutamente
tenga misericordia de mi alma, que yo no siento en mí valor ni fuerzas para
sacar el cuerpo desta estrecheza en que por mi gusto he querido ponerle».
Ésta es, ¡oh señores!, la amarga historia de mi desgracia: decidme si es
tal, que pueda celebrarse con menos sentimientos que los que en mí habéis
visto; y no os canséis en persuadirme ni aconsejarme lo que la razón os
dijere que puede ser bueno para mi remedio, porque ha de aprovechar conmigo
lo que aprovecha la medicina recetada de famoso médico al enfermo que
recebir no la quiere. Yo no quiero salud sin Luscinda; y, pues ella gustó
de ser ajena, siendo, o debiendo ser, mía, guste yo de ser de la
desventura, pudiendo haber sido de la buena dicha. Ella quiso, con su
mudanza, hacer estable mi perdición; yo querré, con procurar perderme,
hacer contenta su voluntad, y será ejemplo a los por venir de que a mí solo
faltó lo que a todos los desdichados sobra, a los cuales suele ser consuelo
la imposibilidad de tenerle, y en mí es causa de mayores sentimientos y
males, porque aun pienso que no se han de acabar con la muerte.
Aquí dio fin Cardenio a su larga plática y tan desdichada como amorosa
historia. Y, al tiempo que el cura se prevenía para decirle algunas razones
de consuelo, le suspendió una voz que llegó a sus oídos, que en lastimados
acentos oyeron que decía lo que se dirá en la cuarta parte desta narración,
que en este punto dio fin a la tercera el sabio y atentado historiador Cide
Hamete Benengeli.
Cuarta parte del ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha
Capítulo XXVIII. Que trata de la nueva y agradable aventura que al cura y
barbero sucedió en la mesma sierra
Felicísimos y venturosos fueron los tiempos donde se echó al mundo el
audacísimo caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, pues por haber tenido tan
honrosa determinación como fue el querer resucitar y volver al mundo la ya
perdida y casi muerta orden de la andante caballería, gozamos ahora, en
esta nuestra edad, necesitada de alegres entretenimientos, no sólo de la
dulzura de su verdadera historia, sino de los cuentos y episodios della,
que, en parte, no son menos agradables y artificiosos y verdaderos que la
misma historia; la cual, prosiguiendo su rastrillado, torcido y aspado
hilo, cuenta que, así como el cura comenzó a prevenirse para consolar a
Cardenio, lo impidió una voz que llegó a sus oídos, que, con tristes
acentos, decía desta manera:
— ¡Ay Dios! ¿Si será posible que he ya hallado lugar que pueda servir de
escondida sepultura a la carga pesada deste cuerpo, que tan contra mi
voluntad sostengo? Sí será, si la soledad que prometen estas sierras no me
miente. ¡Ay, desdichada, y cuán más agradable compañía harán estos riscos y
malezas a mi intención, pues me darán lugar para que con quejas comunique
mi desgracia al cielo, que no la de ningún hombre humano, pues no hay
ninguno en la tierra de quien se pueda esperar consejo en las dudas, alivio
en las quejas, ni remedio en los males!
Todas estas razones oyeron y percibieron el cura y los que con él estaban,
y por parecerles, como ello era, que allí junto las decían, se levantaron a
buscar el dueño, y no hubieron andado veinte pasos, cuando detrás de un
peñasco vieron, sentado al pie de un fresno, a un mozo vestido como
labrador, al cual, por tener inclinado el rostro, a causa de que se lavaba
los pies en el arroyo que por allí corría, no se le pudieron ver por
entonces. Y ellos llegaron con tanto silencio que dél no fueron sentidos,
ni él estaba a otra cosa atento que a lavarse los pies, que eran tales, que
no parecían sino dos pedazos de blanco cristal que entre las otras piedras
del arroyo se habían nacido. Suspendióles la blancura y belleza de los
pies, pareciéndoles que no estaban hechos a pisar terrones, ni a andar tras
el arado y los bueyes, como mostraba el hábito de su dueño; y así, viendo
que no habían sido sentidos, el cura, que iba delante, hizo señas a los
otros dos que se agazapasen o escondiesen detrás de unos pedazos de peña
que allí había, y así lo hicieron todos, mirando con atención lo que el
mozo hacía; el cual traía puesto un capotillo pardo de dos haldas, muy
ceñido al cuerpo con una toalla blanca. Traía, ansimesmo, unos calzones y
polainas de paño pardo, y en la cabeza una montera parda. Tenía las
polainas levantadas hasta la mitad de la pierna, que, sin duda alguna, de
blanco alabastro parecía. Acabóse de lavar los hermosos pies, y luego, con
un paño de tocar, que sacó debajo de la montera, se los limpió; y, al
querer quitársele, alzó el rostro, y tuvieron lugar los que mirándole
estaban de ver una hermosura incomparable; tal, que Cardenio dijo al cura,
con voz baja:
— Ésta, ya que no es Luscinda, no es persona humana, sino divina.
El mozo se quitó la montera, y, sacudiendo la cabeza a una y a otra parte,
se comenzaron a descoger y desparcir unos cabellos, que pudieran los del
sol tenerles envidia. Con esto conocieron que el que parecía labrador era
mujer, y delicada, y aun la más hermosa que hasta entonces los ojos de los
dos habían visto, y aun los de Cardenio, si no hubieran mirado y conocido a
Luscinda; que después afirmó que sola la belleza de Luscinda podía
contender con aquélla. Los luengos y rubios cabellos no sólo le cubrieron
las espaldas, mas toda en torno la escondieron debajo de ellos; que si no
eran los pies, ninguna otra cosa de su cuerpo se parecía: tales y tantos
eran. En esto, les sirvió de peine unas manos, que si los pies en el agua
habían parecido pedazos de cristal, las manos en los cabellos semejaban
pedazos de apretada nieve; todo lo cual, en más admiración y en más deseo
de saber quién era ponía a los tres que la miraban.
Por esto determinaron de mostrarse, y, al movimiento que hicieron de
ponerse en pie, la hermosa moza alzó la cabeza, y, apartándose los cabellos
de delante de los ojos con entrambas manos, miró los que el ruido hacían; y
apenas los hubo visto, cuando se levantó en pie, y, sin aguardar a calzarse
ni a recoger los cabellos, asió con mucha presteza un bulto, como de ropa,
que junto a sí tenía, y quiso ponerse en huida, llena de turbación y
sobresalto; mas no hubo dado seis pasos cuando, no pudiendo sufrir los
delicados pies la aspereza de las piedras, dio consigo en el suelo. Lo cual
visto por los tres, salieron a ella, y el cura fue el primero que le dijo:
— Deteneos, señora, quienquiera que seáis, que los que aquí veis sólo tienen
intención de serviros. No hay para qué os pongáis en tan impertinente
huida, porque ni vuestros pies lo podrán sufrir ni nosotros consentir.
A todo esto, ella no respondía palabra, atónita y confusa. Llegaron, pues,
a ella, y, asiéndola por la mano el cura, prosiguió diciendo:
— Lo que vuestro traje, señora, nos niega, vuestros cabellos nos descubren:
señales claras que no deben de ser de poco momento las causas que han
disfrazado vuestra belleza en hábito tan indigno, y traídola a tanta
soledad como es ésta, en la cual ha sido ventura el hallaros, si no para
dar remedio a vuestros males, a lo menos para darles consejo, pues ningún
mal puede fatigar tanto, ni llegar tan al estremo de serlo, mientras no
acaba la vida, que rehúya de no escuchar siquiera el consejo que con buena
intención se le da al que lo padece. Así que, señora mía, o señor mío, o lo
que vos quisierdes ser, perded el sobresalto que nuestra vista os ha
causado y contadnos vuestra buena o mala suerte; que en nosotros juntos, o
en cada uno, hallaréis quien os ayude a sentir vuestras desgracias.
En tanto que el cura decía estas razones, estaba la disfrazada moza como
embelesada, mirándolos a todos, sin mover labio ni decir palabra alguna:
bien así como rústico aldeano que de improviso se le muestran cosas raras y
dél jamás vistas. Mas, volviendo el cura a decirle otras razones al mesmo
efeto encaminadas, dando ella un profundo suspiro, rompió el silencio y
dijo:
— Pues que la soledad destas sierras no ha sido parte para encubrirme, ni la
soltura de mis descompuestos cabellos no ha permitido que sea mentirosa mi
lengua, en balde sería fingir yo de nuevo ahora lo que, si se me creyese,
sería más por cortesía que por otra razón alguna. Presupuesto esto, digo,
señores, que os agradezco el ofrecimiento que me habéis hecho, el cual me
ha puesto en obligación de satisfaceros en todo lo que me habéis pedido,
puesto que temo que la relación que os hiciere de mis desdichas os ha de
causar, al par de la compasión, la pesadumbre, porque no habéis de hallar
remedio para remediarlas ni consuelo para entretenerlas. Pero, con todo
esto, porque no ande vacilando mi honra en vuestras intenciones, habiéndome
ya conocido por mujer y viéndome moza, sola y en este traje, cosas todas
juntas, y cada una por sí, que pueden echar por tierra cualquier honesto
crédito, os habré de decir lo que quisiera callar si pudiera.
Todo esto dijo sin parar la que tan hermosa mujer parecía, con tan suelta
lengua, con voz tan suave, que no menos les admiró su discreción que su
hermosura. Y, tornándole a hacer nuevos ofrecimientos y nuevos ruegos para
que lo prometido cumpliese, ella, sin hacerse más de rogar, calzándose con
toda honestidad y recogiendo sus cabellos, se acomodó en el asiento de una
piedra, y, puestos los tres alrededor della, haciéndose fuerza por detener
algunas lágrimas que a los ojos se le venían, con voz reposada y clara,
comenzó la historia de su vida desta manera:
— «En esta Andalucía hay un lugar de quien toma título un duque, que le hace
uno de los que llaman grandes en España. Éste tiene dos hijos: el mayor,
heredero de su estado, y, al parecer, de sus buenas costumbres; y el menor,
no sé yo de qué sea heredero, sino de las traiciones de Vellido y de los
embustes de Galalón. Deste señor son vasallos mis padres, humildes en
linaje, pero tan ricos que si los bienes de su naturaleza igualaran a los
de su fortuna, ni ellos tuvieran más que desear ni yo temiera verme en la
desdicha en que me veo; porque quizá nace mi poca ventura de la que no
tuvieron ellos en no haber nacido ilustres. Bien es verdad que no son tan
bajos que puedan afrentarse de su estado, ni tan altos que a mí me quiten
la imaginación que tengo de que de su humildad viene mi desgracia. Ellos,
en fin, son labradores, gente llana, sin mezcla de alguna raza mal sonante,
y, como suele decirse, cristianos viejos ranciosos; pero tan ricos que su
riqueza y magnífico trato les va poco a poco adquiriendo nombre de
hidalgos, y aun de caballeros. Puesto que de la mayor riqueza y nobleza que
ellos se preciaban era de tenerme a mí por hija; y, así por no tener otra
ni otro que los heredase como por ser padres, y aficionados, yo era una de
las más regaladas hijas que padres jamás regalaron. Era el espejo en que se
miraban, el báculo de su vejez, y el sujeto a quien encaminaban,
midiéndolos con el cielo, todos sus deseos; de los cuales, por ser ellos
tan buenos, los míos no salían un punto. Y del mismo modo que yo era señora
de sus ánimos, ansí lo era de su hacienda: por mí se recebían y despedían
los criados; la razón y cuenta de lo que se sembraba y cogía pasaba por mi
mano; los molinos de aceite, los lagares de vino, el número del ganado
mayor y menor, el de las colmenas. Finalmente, de todo aquello que un tan
rico labrador como mi padre puede tener y tiene, tenía yo la cuenta, y era
la mayordoma y señora, con tanta solicitud mía y con tanto gusto suyo, que
buenamente no acertaré a encarecerlo. Los ratos que del día me quedaban,
después de haber dado lo que convenía a los mayorales, a capataces y a
otros jornaleros, los entretenía en ejercicios que son a las doncellas tan
lícitos como necesarios, como son los que ofrece la aguja y la almohadilla,
y la rueca muchas veces; y si alguna, por recrear el ánimo, estos
ejercicios dejaba, me acogía al entretenimiento de leer algún libro devoto,
o a tocar una arpa, porque la experiencia me mostraba que la música compone
los ánimos descompuestos y alivia los trabajos que nacen del espíritu.
»Ésta, pues, era la vida que yo tenía en casa de mis padres, la cual, si
tan particularmente he contado, no ha sido por ostentación ni por dar a
entender que soy rica, sino porque se advierta cuán sin culpa me he venido
de aquel buen estado que he dicho al infelice en que ahora me hallo. Es,
pues, el caso que, pasando mi vida en tantas ocupaciones y en un
encerramiento tal que al de un monesterio pudiera compararse, sin ser
vista, a mi parecer, de otra persona alguna que de los criados de casa,
porque los días que iba a misa era tan de mañana, y tan acompañada de mi
madre y de otras criadas, y yo tan cubierta y recatada que apenas vían mis
ojos más tierra de aquella donde ponía los pies; y, con todo esto, los del
amor, o los de la ociosidad, por mejor decir, a quien los de lince no
pueden igualarse, me vieron, puestos en la solicitud de don Fernando, que
éste es el nombre del hijo menor del duque que os he contado».
No hubo bien nombrado a don Fernando la que el cuento contaba, cuando a
Cardenio se le mudó la color del rostro, y comenzó a trasudar, con tan
grande alteración que el cura y el barbero, que miraron en ello, temieron
que le venía aquel accidente de locura que habían oído decir que de cuando
en cuando le venía. Mas Cardenio no hizo otra cosa que trasudar y estarse
quedo, mirando de hito en hito a la labradora, imaginando quién ella era;
la cual, sin advertir en los movimientos de Cardenio, prosiguió su
historia, diciendo:
— «Y no me hubieron bien visto cuando, según él dijo después, quedó tan
preso de mis amores cuanto lo dieron bien a entender sus demostraciones.
Mas, por acabar presto con el cuento, que no le tiene, de mis desdichas,
quiero pasar en silencio las diligencias que don Fernando hizo para
declararme su voluntad. Sobornó toda la gente de mi casa, dio y ofreció
dádivas y mercedes a mis parientes. Los días eran todos de fiesta y de
regocijo en mi calle; las noches no dejaban dormir a nadie las músicas. Los
billetes que, sin saber cómo, a mis manos venían, eran infinitos, llenos de
enamoradas razones y ofrecimientos, con menos letras que promesas y
juramentos. Todo lo cual no sólo no me ablandaba, pero me endurecía de
manera como si fuera mi mortal enemigo, y que todas las obras que para
reducirme a su voluntad hacía, las hiciera para el efeto contrario; no
porque a mí me pareciese mal la gentileza de don Fernando, ni que tuviese a
demasía sus solicitudes; porque me daba un no sé qué de contento verme tan
querida y estimada de un tan principal caballero, y no me pesaba ver en sus
papeles mis alabanzas: que en esto, por feas que seamos las mujeres, me
parece a mí que siempre nos da gusto el oír que nos llaman hermosas.
»Pero a todo esto se opone mi honestidad y los consejos continuos que mis
padres me daban, que ya muy al descubierto sabían la voluntad de don
Fernando, porque ya a él no se le daba nada de que todo el mundo la
supiese. Decíanme mis padres que en sola mi virtud y bondad dejaban y
depositaban su honra y fama, y que considerase la desigualdad que había
entre mí y don Fernando, y que por aquí echaría de ver que sus
pensamientos, aunque él dijese otra cosa, mas se encaminaban a su gusto que
a mi provecho; y que si yo quisiese poner en alguna manera algún
inconveniente para que él se dejase de su injusta pretensión, que ellos me
casarían luego con quien yo más gustase: así de los más principales de
nuestro lugar como de todos los circunvecinos, pues todo se podía esperar
de su mucha hacienda y de mi buena fama. Con estos ciertos prometimientos,
y con la verdad que ellos me decían, fortificaba yo mi entereza, y jamás
quise responder a don Fernando palabra que le pudiese mostrar, aunque de
muy lejos, esperanza de alcanzar su deseo.
»Todos estos recatos míos, que él debía de tener por desdenes, debieron de
ser causa de avivar más su lascivo apetito, que este nombre quiero dar a la
voluntad que me mostraba; la cual, si ella fuera como debía, no la
supiérades vosotros ahora, porque hubiera faltado la ocasión de decírosla.
Finalmente, don Fernando supo que mis padres andaban por darme estado, por
quitalle a él la esperanza de poseerme, o, a lo menos, porque yo tuviese
más guardas para guardarme; y esta nueva o sospecha fue causa para que
hiciese lo que ahora oiréis. Y fue que una noche, estando yo en mi aposento
con sola la compañía de una doncella que me servía, teniendo bien cerradas
las puertas, por temor que, por descuido, mi honestidad no se viese en
peligro, sin saber ni imaginar cómo, en medio destos recatos y
prevenciones, y en la soledad deste silencio y encierro, me le hallé
delante, cuya vista me turbó de manera que me quitó la de mis ojos y me
enmudeció la lengua; y así, no fui poderosa de dar voces, ni aun él creo
que me las dejara dar, porque luego se llegó a mí, y, tomándome entre sus
brazos (porque yo, como digo, no tuve fuerzas para defenderme, según estaba
turbada), comenzó a decirme tales razones, que no sé cómo es posible que
tenga tanta habilidad la mentira que las sepa componer de modo que parezcan
tan verdaderas. Hacía el traidor que sus lágrimas acreditasen sus palabras
y los suspiros su intención. Yo, pobrecilla, sola entre los míos, mal
ejercitada en casos semejantes, comencé, no sé en qué modo, a tener por
verdaderas tantas falsedades, pero no de suerte que me moviesen a compasión
menos que buena sus lágrimas y suspiros.
»Y así, pasándoseme aquel sobresalto primero, torné algún tanto a cobrar
mis perdidos espíritus, y con más ánimo del que pensé que pudiera tener, le
dije: ''Si como estoy, señor, en tus brazos, estuviera entre los de un león
fiero y el librarme dellos se me asegurara con que hiciera, o dijera, cosa
que fuera en perjuicio de mi honestidad, así fuera posible hacella o
decilla como es posible dejar de haber sido lo que fue. Así que, si tú
tienes ceñido mi cuerpo con tus brazos, yo tengo atada mi alma con mis
buenos deseos, que son tan diferentes de los tuyos como lo verás si con
hacerme fuerza quisieres pasar adelante en ellos. Tu vasalla soy, pero no
tu esclava; ni tiene ni debe tener imperio la nobleza de tu sangre para
deshonrar y tener en poco la humildad de la mía; y en tanto me estimo yo,
villana y labradora, como tú, señor y caballero. Conmigo no han de ser de
ningún efecto tus fuerzas, ni han de tener valor tus riquezas, ni tus
palabras han de poder engañarme, ni tus suspiros y lágrimas enternecerme.
Si alguna de todas estas cosas que he dicho viera yo en el que mis padres
me dieran por esposo, a su voluntad se ajustara la mía, y mi voluntad de la
suya no saliera; de modo que, como quedara con honra, aunque quedara sin
gusto, de grado te entregara lo que tú, señor, ahora con tanta fuerza
procuras. Todo esto he dicho porque no es pensar que de mí alcance cosa
alguna el que no fuere mi ligítimo esposo''. ''Si no reparas más que en
eso, bellísima Dorotea —(que éste es el nombre desta desdichada), dijo el
desleal caballero—, ves: aquí te doy la mano de serlo tuyo, y sean testigos
desta verdad los cielos, a quien ninguna cosa se asconde, y esta imagen de
Nuestra Señora que aquí tienes''.»
Cuando Cardenio le oyó decir que se llamaba Dorotea, tornó de nuevo a sus
sobresaltos y acabó de confirmar por verdadera su primera opinión; pero no
quiso interromper el cuento, por ver en qué venía a parar lo que él ya casi
sabía; sólo dijo:
— ¿Que Dorotea es tu nombre, señora? Otra he oído yo decir del mesmo, que
quizá corre parejas con tus desdichas. Pasa adelante, que tiempo vendrá en
que te diga cosas que te espanten en el mesmo grado que te lastimen.
Reparó Dorotea en las razones de Cardenio y en su estraño y desastrado
traje, y rogóle que si alguna cosa de su hacienda sabía, se la dijese
luego; porque si algo le había dejado bueno la fortuna, era el ánimo que
tenía para sufrir cualquier desastre que le sobreviniese, segura de que, a
su parecer, ninguno podía llegar que el que tenía acrecentase un punto.
— No le perdiera yo, señora —respondió Cardenio—, en decirte lo que pienso,
si fuera verdad lo que imagino; y hasta ahora no se pierde coyuntura, ni a
ti te importa nada el saberlo.
— Sea lo que fuere —respondió Dorotea—, «lo que en mi cuento pasa fue que,
tomando don Fernando una imagen que en aquel aposento estaba, la puso por
testigo de nuestro desposorio. Con palabras eficacísimas y juramentos
estraordinarios, me dio la palabra de ser mi marido, puesto que, antes que
acabase de decirlas, le dije que mirase bien lo que hacía y que considerase
el enojo que su padre había de recebir de verle casado con una villana
vasalla suya; que no le cegase mi hermosura, tal cual era, pues no era
bastante para hallar en ella disculpa de su yerro, y que si algún bien me
quería hacer, por el amor que me tenía, fuese dejar correr mi suerte a lo
igual de lo que mi calidad podía, porque nunca los tan desiguales
casamientos se gozan ni duran mucho en aquel gusto con que se comienzan.
»Todas estas razones que aquí he dicho le dije, y otras muchas de que no me
acuerdo, pero no fueron parte para que él dejase de seguir su intento, bien
ansí como el que no piensa pagar, que, al concertar de la barata, no repara
en inconvenientes. Yo, a esta sazón, hice un breve discurso conmigo, y me
dije a mí mesma: ''Sí, que no seré yo la primera que por vía de matrimonio
haya subido de humilde a grande estado, ni será don Fernando el primero a
quien hermosura, o ciega afición, que es lo más cierto, haya hecho tomar
compañía desigual a su grandeza. Pues si no hago ni mundo ni uso nuevo,
bien es acudir a esta honra que la suerte me ofrece, puesto que en éste no
dure más la voluntad que me muestra de cuanto dure el cumplimiento de su
deseo; que, en fin, para con Dios seré su esposa. Y si quiero con desdenes
despedille, en término le veo que, no usando el que debe, usará el de la
fuerza y vendré a quedar deshonrada y sin disculpa de la culpa que me podía
dar el que no supiere cuán sin ella he venido a este punto. Porque, ¿qué
razones serán bastantes para persuadir a mis padres, y a otros, que este
caballero entró en mi aposento sin consentimiento mío?''
»Todas estas demandas y respuestas revolví yo en un instante en la
imaginación; y, sobre todo, me comenzaron a hacer fuerza y a inclinarme a
lo que fue, sin yo pensarlo, mi perdición: los juramentos de don Fernando,
los testigos que ponía, las lágrimas que derramaba, y, finalmente, su
dispusición y gentileza, que, acompañada con tantas muestras de verdadero
amor, pudieran rendir a otro tan libre y recatado corazón como el mío.
Llamé a mi criada, para que en la tierra acompañase a los testigos del
cielo; tornó don Fernando a reiterar y confirmar sus juramentos; añadió a
los primeros nuevos santos por testigos; echóse mil futuras maldiciones, si
no cumpliese lo que me prometía; volvió a humedecer sus ojos y a acrecentar
sus suspiros; apretóme más entre sus brazos, de los cuales jamás me había
dejado; y con esto, y con volverse a salir del aposento mi doncella, yo
dejé de serlo y él acabó de ser traidor y fementido.
»El día que sucedió a la noche de mi desgracia se venía aun no tan apriesa
como yo pienso que don Fernando deseaba, porque, después de cumplido
aquello que el apetito pide, el mayor gusto que puede venir es apartarse de
donde le alcanzaron. Digo esto porque don Fernando dio priesa por partirse
de mí, y, por industria de mi doncella, que era la misma que allí le había
traído, antes que amaneciese se vio en la calle. Y, al despedirse de mí,
aunque no con tanto ahínco y vehemencia como cuando vino, me dijo que
estuviese segura de su fe y de ser firmes y verdaderos sus juramentos; y,
para más confirmación de su palabra, sacó un rico anillo del dedo y lo puso
en el mío. En efecto, él se fue y yo quedé ni sé si triste o alegre; esto
sé bien decir: que quedé confusa y pensativa, y casi fuera de mí con el
nuevo acaecimiento, y no tuve ánimo, o no se me acordó, de reñir a mi
doncella por la traición cometida de encerrar a don Fernando en mi mismo
aposento, porque aún no me determinaba si era bien o mal el que me había
sucedido. Díjele, al partir, a don Fernando que por el mesmo camino de
aquélla podía verme otras noches, pues ya era suya, hasta que, cuando él
quisiese, aquel hecho se publicase. Pero no vino otra alguna, si no fue la
siguiente, ni yo pude verle en la calle ni en la iglesia en más de un mes;
que en vano me cansé en solicitallo, puesto que supe que estaba en la villa
y que los más días iba a caza, ejercicio de que él era muy aficionado.
»Estos días y estas horas bien sé yo que para mí fueron aciagos y
menguadas, y bien sé que comencé a dudar en ellos, y aun a descreer de la
fe de don Fernando; y sé también que mi doncella oyó entonces las palabras
que en reprehensión de su atrevimiento antes no había oído; y sé que me fue
forzoso tener cuenta con mis lágrimas y con la compostura de mi rostro, por
no dar ocasión a que mis padres me preguntasen que de qué andaba
descontenta y me obligasen a buscar mentiras que decilles. Pero todo esto
se acabó en un punto, llegándose uno donde se atropellaron respectos y se
acabaron los honrados discursos, y adonde se perdió la paciencia y salieron
a plaza mis secretos pensamientos. Y esto fue porque, de allí a pocos días,
se dijo en el lugar como en una ciudad allí cerca se había casado don
Fernando con una doncella hermosísima en todo estremo, y de muy principales
padres, aunque no tan rica que, por la dote, pudiera aspirar a tan noble
casamiento. Díjose que se llamaba Luscinda, con otras cosas que en sus
desposorios sucedieron dignas de admiración.»
Oyó Cardenio el nombre de Luscinda, y no hizo otra cosa que encoger los
hombros, morderse los labios, enarcar las cejas y dejar de allí a poco caer
por sus ojos dos fuentes de lágrimas. Mas no por esto dejó Dorotea de
seguir su cuento, diciendo:
— «Llegó esta triste nueva a mis oídos, y, en lugar de helárseme el corazón
en oílla, fue tanta la cólera y rabia que se encendió en él, que faltó poco
para no salirme por las calles dando voces, publicando la alevosía y
traición que se me había hecho. Mas templóse esta furia por entonces con
pensar de poner aquella mesma noche por obra lo que puse: que fue ponerme
en este hábito, que me dio uno de los que llaman zagales en casa de los
labradores, que era criado de mi padre, al cual descubrí toda mi
desventura, y le rogué me acompañase hasta la ciudad donde entendí que mi
enemigo estaba. Él, después que hubo reprehendido mi atrevimiento y afeado
mi determinación, viéndome resuelta en mi parecer, se ofreció a tenerme
compañía, como él dijo, hasta el cabo del mundo. Luego, al momento, encerré
en una almohada de lienzo un vestido de mujer, y algunas joyas y dineros,
por lo que podía suceder. Y en el silencio de aquella noche, sin dar cuenta
a mi traidora doncella, salí de mi casa, acompañada de mi criado y de
muchas imaginaciones, y me puse en camino de la ciudad a pie, llevada en
vuelo del deseo de llegar, ya que no a estorbar lo que tenía por hecho, a
lo menos a decir a don Fernando me dijese con qué alma lo había hecho.
»Llegué en dos días y medio donde quería, y, en entrando por la ciudad,
pregunté por la casa de los padres de Luscinda, y al primero a quien hice
la pregunta me respondió más de lo que yo quisiera oír. Díjome la casa y
todo lo que había sucedido en el desposorio de su hija, cosa tan pública en
la ciudad, que se hace en corrillos para contarla por toda ella. Díjome que
la noche que don Fernando se desposó con Luscinda, después de haber ella
dado el sí de ser su esposa, le había tomado un recio desmayo, y que,
llegando su esposo a desabrocharle el pecho para que le diese el aire, le
halló un papel escrito de la misma letra de Luscinda, en que decía y
declaraba que ella no podía ser esposa de don Fernando, porque lo era de
Cardenio, que, a lo que el hombre me dijo, era un caballero muy principal
de la mesma ciudad; y que si había dado el sí a don Fernando, fue por no
salir de la obediencia de sus padres. En resolución, tales razones dijo que
contenía el papel, que daba a entender que ella había tenido intención de
matarse en acabándose de desposar, y daba allí las razones por que se había
quitado la vida. Todo lo cual dicen que confirmó una daga que le hallaron
no sé en qué parte de sus vestidos. Todo lo cual visto por don Fernando,
pareciéndole que Luscinda le había burlado y escarnecido y tenido en poco,
arremetió a ella, antes que de su desmayo volviese, y con la misma daga que
le hallaron la quiso dar de puñaladas; y lo hiciera si sus padres y los que
se hallaron presentes no se lo estorbaran. Dijeron más: que luego se
ausentó don Fernando, y que Luscinda no había vuelto de su parasismo hasta
otro día, que contó a sus padres cómo ella era verdadera esposa de aquel
Cardenio que he dicho. Supe más: que el Cardenio, según decían, se halló
presente en los desposorios, y que, en viéndola desposada, lo cual él jamás
pensó, se salió de la ciudad desesperado, dejándole primero escrita una
carta, donde daba a entender el agravio que Luscinda le había hecho, y de
cómo él se iba adonde gentes no le viesen.
»Esto todo era público y notorio en toda la ciudad, y todos hablaban dello;
y más hablaron cuando supieron que Luscinda había faltado de casa de sus
padres y de la ciudad, pues no la hallaron en toda ella, de que perdían el
juicio sus padres y no sabían qué medio se tomar para hallarla. Esto que
supe puso en bando mis esperanzas, y tuve por mejor no haber hallado a don
Fernando, que no hallarle casado, pareciéndome que aún no estaba del todo
cerrada la puerta a mi remedio, dándome yo a entender que podría ser que el
cielo hubiese puesto aquel impedimento en el segundo matrimonio, por
atraerle a conocer lo que al primero debía, y a caer en la cuenta de que
era cristiano y que estaba más obligado a su alma que a los respetos
humanos. Todas estas cosas revolvía en mi fantasía, y me consolaba sin
tener consuelo, fingiendo unas esperanzas largas y desmayadas, para
entretener la vida, que ya aborrezco.
»Estando, pues, en la ciudad, sin saber qué hacerme, pues a don Fernando no
hallaba, llegó a mis oídos un público pregón, donde se prometía grande
hallazgo a quien me hallase, dando las señas de la edad y del mesmo traje
que traía; y oí decir que se decía que me había sacado de casa de mis
padres el mozo que conmigo vino, cosa que me llegó al alma, por ver cuán de
caída andaba mi crédito, pues no bastaba perderle con mi venida, sino
añadir el con quién, siendo subjeto tan bajo y tan indigno de mis buenos
pensamientos. Al punto que oí el pregón, me salí de la ciudad con mi
criado, que ya comenzaba a dar muestras de titubear en la fe que de
fidelidad me tenía prometida, y aquella noche nos entramos por lo espeso
desta montaña, con el miedo de no ser hallados. Pero, como suele decirse
que un mal llama a otro, y que el fin de una desgracia suele ser principio
de otra mayor, así me sucedió a mí, porque mi buen criado, hasta entonces
fiel y seguro, así como me vio en esta soledad, incitado de su mesma
bellaquería antes que de mi hermosura, quiso aprovecharse de la ocasión
que, a su parecer, estos yermos le ofrecían; y, con poca vergüenza y menos
temor de Dios ni respeto mío, me requirió de amores; y, viendo que yo con
feas y justas palabras respondía a las desvergüenzas de sus propósitos,
dejó aparte los ruegos, de quien primero pensó aprovecharse, y comenzó a
usar de la fuerza. Pero el justo cielo, que pocas o ningunas veces deja de
mirar y favorecer a las justas intenciones, favoreció las mías, de manera
que con mis pocas fuerzas, y con poco trabajo, di con él por un
derrumbadero, donde le dejé, ni sé si muerto o si vivo; y luego, con más
ligereza que mi sobresalto y cansancio pedían, me entré por estas montañas,
sin llevar otro pensamiento ni otro disignio que esconderme en ellas y huir
de mi padre y de aquellos que de su parte me andaban buscando.
»Con este deseo, ha no sé cuántos meses que entré en ellas, donde hallé un
ganadero que me llevó por su criado a un lugar que está en las entrañas
desta sierra, al cual he servido de zagal todo este tiempo, procurando
estar siempre en el campo por encubrir estos cabellos que ahora, tan si
pensarlo, me han descubierto. Pero toda mi industria y toda mi solicitud
fue y ha sido de ningún provecho, pues mi amo vino en conocimiento de que
yo no era varón, y nació en él el mesmo mal pensamiento que en mi criado;
y, como no siempre la fortuna con los trabajos da los remedios, no hallé
derrumbadero ni barranco de donde despeñar y despenar al amo, como le hallé
para el criado; y así, tuve por menor inconveniente dejalle y asconderme de
nuevo entre estas asperezas que probar con él mis fuerzas o mis disculpas.
Digo, pues, que me torné a emboscar, y a buscar donde sin impedimento
alguno pudiese con suspiros y lágrimas rogar al cielo se duela de mi
desventura y me dé industria y favor para salir della, o para dejar la vida
entre estas soledades, sin que quede memoria desta triste, que tan sin
culpa suya habrá dado materia para que de ella se hable y murmure en la
suya y en las ajenas tierras.»
Capítulo XXIX. Que trata de la discreción de la hermosa Dorotea, con otras
cosas de mucho gusto y pasatiempo
— Esta es, señores, la verdadera historia de mi tragedia: mirad y juzgad
ahora si los suspiros que escuchastes, las palabras que oístes y las
lágrimas que de mis ojos salían, tenían ocasión bastante para mostrarse en
mayor abundancia; y, considerada la calidad de mi desgracia, veréis que
será en vano el consuelo, pues es imposible el remedio della. Sólo os ruego
(lo que con facilidad podréis y debéis hacer) que me aconsejéis dónde podré
pasar la vida sin que me acabe el temor y sobresalto que tengo de ser
hallada de los que me buscan; que, aunque sé que el mucho amor que mis
padres me tienen me asegura que seré dellos bien recebida, es tanta la
vergüenza que me ocupa sólo el pensar que, no como ellos pensaban, tengo de
parecer a su presencia, que tengo por mejor desterrarme para siempre de ser
vista que no verles el rostro, con pensamiento que ellos miran el mío ajeno
de la honestidad que de mí se debían de tener prometida.
Calló en diciendo esto, y el rostro se le cubrió de un color que mostró
bien claro el sentimiento y vergüenza del alma. En las suyas sintieron los
que escuchado la habían tanta lástima como admiración de su desgracia; y,
aunque luego quisiera el cura consolarla y aconsejarla, tomó primero la
mano Cardenio, diciendo:
— En fin, señora, que tú eres la hermosa Dorotea, la hija única del rico
Clenardo.
Admirada quedó Dorotea cuando oyó el nombre de su padre, y de ver cuán de
poco era el que le nombraba, porque ya se ha dicho de la mala manera que
Cardenio estaba vestido; y así, le dijo:
— Y ¿quién sois vos, hermano, que así sabéis el nombre de mi padre? Porque
yo, hasta ahora, si mal no me acuerdo, en todo el discurso del cuento de mi
desdicha no le he nombrado.
— Soy —respondió Cardenio— aquel sin ventura que, según vos, señora, habéis
dicho, Luscinda dijo que era su esposa. Soy el desdichado Cardenio, a quien
el mal término de aquel que a vos os ha puesto en el que estáis me ha
traído a que me veáis cual me veis: roto, desnudo, falto de todo humano
consuelo y, lo que es peor de todo, falto de juicio, pues no le tengo sino
cuando al cielo se le antoja dármele por algún breve espacio. Yo, Teodora,
soy el que me hallé presente a las sinrazones de don Fernando, y el que
aguardó oír el sí que de ser su esposa pronunció Luscinda. Yo soy el que no
tuvo ánimo para ver en qué paraba su desmayo, ni lo que resultaba del papel
que le fue hallado en el pecho, porque no tuvo el alma sufrimiento para ver
tantas desventuras juntas; y así, dejé la casa y la paciencia, y una carta
que dejé a un huésped mío, a quien rogué que en manos de Luscinda la
pusiese, y víneme a estas soledades, con intención de acabar en ellas la
vida, que desde aquel punto aborrecí como mortal enemiga mía. Mas no ha
querido la suerte quitármela, contentándose con quitarme el juicio, quizá
por guardarme para la buena ventura que he tenido en hallaros; pues, siendo
verdad, como creo que lo es, lo que aquí habéis contado, aún podría ser que
a entrambos nos tuviese el cielo guardado mejor suceso en nuestros
desastres que nosotros pensamos. Porque, presupuesto que Luscinda no puede
casarse con don Fernando, por ser mía, ni don Fernando con ella, por ser
vuestro, y haberlo ella tan manifiestamente declarado, bien podemos esperar
que el cielo nos restituya lo que es nuestro, pues está todavía en ser, y
no se ha enajenado ni deshecho. Y, pues este consuelo tenemos, nacido no de
muy remota esperanza, ni fundado en desvariadas imaginaciones, suplícoos,
señora, que toméis otra resolución en vuestros honrados pensamientos, pues
yo la pienso tomar en los míos, acomodándoos a esperar mejor fortuna; que
yo os juro, por la fe de caballero y de cristiano, de no desampararos hasta
veros en poder de don Fernando, y que, cuando con razones no le pudiere
atraer a que conozca lo que os debe, de usar entonces la libertad que me
concede el ser caballero, y poder con justo título desafialle, en razón de
la sinrazón que os hace, sin acordarme de mis agravios, cuya venganza
dejaré al cielo por acudir en la tierra a los vuestros.
Con lo que Cardenio dijo se acabó de admirar Dorotea, y, por no saber qué
gracias volver a tan grandes ofrecimientos, quiso tomarle los pies para
besárselos; mas no lo consintió Cardenio, y el licenciado respondió por
entrambos, y aprobó el buen discurso de Cardenio, y, sobre todo, les rogó,
aconsejó y persuadió que se fuesen con él a su aldea, donde se podrían
reparar de las cosas que les faltaban, y que allí se daría orden cómo
buscar a don Fernando, o cómo llevar a Dorotea a sus padres, o hacer lo que
más les pareciese conveniente. Cardenio y Dorotea se lo agradecieron, y
acetaron la merced que se les ofrecía. El barbero, que a todo había estado
suspenso y callado, hizo también su buena plática y se ofreció con no menos
voluntad que el cura a todo aquello que fuese bueno para servirles.
Contó asimesmo con brevedad la causa que allí los había traído, con la
estrañeza de la locura de don Quijote, y cómo aguardaban a su escudero, que
había ido a buscalle. Vínosele a la memoria a Cardenio, como por sueños, la
pendencia que con don Quijote había tenido y contóla a los demás, mas no
supo decir por qué causa fue su quistión.
En esto, oyeron voces, y conocieron que el que las daba era Sancho Panza,
que, por no haberlos hallado en el lugar donde los dejó, los llamaba a
voces. Saliéronle al encuentro, y, preguntándole por don Quijote, les dijo
cómo le había hallado desnudo en camisa, flaco, amarillo y muerto de
hambre, y suspirando por su señora Dulcinea; y que, puesto que le había
dicho que ella le mandaba que saliese de aquel lugar y se fuese al del
Toboso, donde le quedaba esperando, había respondido que estaba determinado
de no parecer ante su fermosura fasta que hobiese fecho fazañas que le
ficiesen digno de su gracia. Y que si aquello pasaba adelante, corría
peligro de no venir a ser emperador, como estaba obligado, ni aun
arzobispo, que era lo menos que podía ser. Por eso, que mirasen lo que se
había de hacer para sacarle de allí.
El licenciado le respondió que no tuviese pena, que ellos le sacarían de
allí, mal que le pesase. Contó luego a Cardenio y a Dorotea lo que tenían
pensado para remedio de don Quijote, a lo menos para llevarle a su casa. A
lo cual dijo Dorotea que ella haría la doncella menesterosa mejor que el
barbero, y más, que tenía allí vestidos con que hacerlo al natural, y que
la dejasen el cargo de saber representar todo aquello que fuese menester
para llevar adelante su intento, porque ella había leído muchos libros de
caballerías y sabía bien el estilo que tenían las doncellas cuitadas cuando
pedían sus dones a los andantes caballeros.
— Pues no es menester más —dijo el cura— sino que luego se ponga por obra;
que, sin duda, la buena suerte se muestra en favor nuestro, pues, tan sin
pensarlo, a vosotros, señores, se os ha comenzado a abrir puerta para
vuestro remedio y a nosotros se nos ha facilitado la que habíamos menester.
Sacó luego Dorotea de su almohada una saya entera de cierta telilla rica y
una mantellina de otra vistosa tela verde, y de una cajita un collar y
otras joyas, con que en un instante se adornó de manera que una rica y gran
señora parecía. Todo aquello, y más, dijo que había sacado de su casa para
lo que se ofreciese, y que hasta entonces no se le había ofrecido ocasión
de habello menester. A todos contentó en estremo su mucha gracia, donaire y
hermosura, y confirmaron a don Fernando por de poco conocimiento, pues
tanta belleza desechaba.
Pero el que más se admiró fue Sancho Panza, por parecerle —como era así
verdad— que en todos los días de su vida había visto tan hermosa criatura;
y así, preguntó al cura con grande ahínco le dijese quién era aquella tan
fermosa señora, y qué era lo que buscaba por aquellos andurriales.
— Esta hermosa señora —respondió el cura—, Sancho hermano, es, como quien no
dice nada, es la heredera por línea recta de varón del gran reino de
Micomicón, la cual viene en busca de vuestro amo a pedirle un don, el cual
es que le desfaga un tuerto o agravio que un mal gigante le tiene fecho; y,
a la fama que de buen caballero vuestro amo tiene por todo lo descubierto,
de Guinea ha venido a buscarle esta princesa.
— Dichosa buscada y dichoso hallazgo —dijo a esta sazón Sancho Panza—, y más
si mi amo es tan venturoso que desfaga ese agravio y enderece ese tuerto,
matando a ese hideputa dese gigante que vuestra merced dice; que sí matará
si él le encuentra, si ya no fuese fantasma, que contra las fantasmas no
tiene mi señor poder alguno. Pero una cosa quiero suplicar a vuestra
merced, entre otras, señor licenciado, y es que, porque a mi amo no le tome
gana de ser arzobispo, que es lo que yo temo, que vuestra merced le
aconseje que se case luego con esta princesa, y así quedará imposibilitado
de recebir órdenes arzobispales y vendrá con facilidad a su imperio y yo al
fin de mis deseos; que yo he mirado bien en ello y hallo por mi cuenta que
no me está bien que mi amo sea arzobispo, porque yo soy inútil para la
Iglesia, pues soy casado, y andarme ahora a traer dispensaciones para poder
tener renta por la Iglesia, teniendo, como tengo, mujer y hijos, sería
nunca acabar. Así que, señor, todo el toque está en que mi amo se case
luego con esta señora, que hasta ahora no sé su gracia, y así, no la llamo
por su nombre.
— Llámase —respondió el cura— la princesa Micomicona, porque, llamándose su
reino Micomicón, claro está que ella se ha de llamar así.
— No hay duda en eso —respondió Sancho—, que yo he visto a muchos tomar el
apellido y alcurnia del lugar donde nacieron, llamándose Pedro de Alcalá,
Juan de Úbeda y Diego de Valladolid; y esto mesmo se debe de usar allá en
Guinea: tomar las reinas los nombres de sus reinos.
— Así debe de ser —dijo el cura—; y en lo del casarse vuestro amo, yo haré
en ello todos mis poderíos.
Con lo que quedó tan contento Sancho cuanto el cura admirado de su
simplicidad, y de ver cuán encajados tenía en la fantasía los mesmos
disparates que su amo, pues sin alguna duda se daba a entender que había de
venir a ser emperador.
Ya, en esto, se había puesto Dorotea sobre la mula del cura y el barbero se
había acomodado al rostro la barba de la cola de buey, y dijeron a Sancho
que los guiase adonde don Quijote estaba; al cual advirtieron que no dijese
que conocía al licenciado ni al barbero, porque en no conocerlos consistía
todo el toque de venir a ser emperador su amo; puesto que ni el cura ni
Cardenio quisieron ir con ellos, porque no se le acordase a don Quijote la
pendencia que con Cardenio había tenido, y el cura porque no era menester
por entonces su presencia. Y así, los dejaron ir delante, y ellos los
fueron siguiendo a pie, poco a poco. No dejó de avisar el cura lo que había
de hacer Dorotea; a lo que ella dijo que descuidasen, que todo se haría,
sin faltar punto, como lo pedían y pintaban los libros de caballerías.
Tres cuartos de legua habrían andado, cuando descubrieron a don Quijote
entre unas intricadas peñas, ya vestido, aunque no armado; y, así como
Dorotea le vio y fue informada de Sancho que aquél era don Quijote, dio del
azote a su palafrén, siguiéndole el bien barbado barbero. Y, en llegando
junto a él, el escudero se arrojó de la mula y fue a tomar en los brazos a
Dorotea, la cual, apeándose con grande desenvoltura, se fue a hincar de
rodillas ante las de don Quijote; y, aunque él pugnaba por levantarla,
ella, sin levantarse, le fabló en esta guisa:
— De aquí no me levantaré, ¡oh valeroso y esforzado caballero!, fasta que la
vuestra bondad y cortesía me otorgue un don, el cual redundará en honra y
prez de vuestra persona, y en pro de la más desconsolada y agraviada
doncella que el sol ha visto. Y si es que el valor de vuestro fuerte brazo
corresponde a la voz de vuestra inmortal fama, obligado estáis a favorecer
a la sin ventura que de tan lueñes tierras viene, al olor de vuestro famoso
nombre, buscándoos para remedio de sus desdichas.
— No os responderé palabra, fermosa señora —respondió don Quijote—, ni oiré
más cosa de vuestra facienda, fasta que os levantéis de tierra.
— No me levantaré, señor —respondió la afligida doncella—, si primero, por
la vuestra cortesía, no me es otorgado el don que pido.
— Yo vos le otorgo y concedo —respondió don Quijote—, como no se haya de
cumplir en daño o mengua de mi rey, de mi patria y de aquella que de mi
corazón y libertad tiene la llave.
— No será en daño ni en mengua de los que decís, mi buen señor —replicó la
dolorosa doncella.
Y, estando en esto, se llegó Sancho Panza al oído de su señor y muy pasito
le dijo:
— Bien puede vuestra merced, señor, concederle el don que pide, que no es
cosa de nada: sólo es matar a un gigantazo, y esta que lo pide es la alta
princesa Micomicona, reina del gran reino Micomicón de Etiopía.
— Sea quien fuere —respondió don Quijote—, que yo haré lo que soy obligado y
lo que me dicta mi conciencia, conforme a lo que profesado tengo.
Y, volviéndose a la doncella, dijo:
— La vuestra gran fermosura se levante, que yo le otorgo el don que pedirme
quisiere.
— Pues el que pido es —dijo la doncella— que la vuestra magnánima persona se
venga luego conmigo donde yo le llevare, y me prometa que no se ha de
entremeter en otra aventura ni demanda alguna hasta darme venganza de un
traidor que, contra todo derecho divino y humano, me tiene usurpado mi
reino.
— Digo que así lo otorgo —respondió don Quijote—, y así podéis, señora,
desde hoy más, desechar la malenconía que os fatiga y hacer que cobre
nuevos bríos y fuerzas vuestra desmayada esperanza; que, con el ayuda de
Dios y la de mi brazo, vos os veréis presto restituida en vuestro reino y
sentada en la silla de vuestro antiguo y grande estado, a pesar y a
despecho de los follones que contradecirlo quisieren. Y manos a labor, que
en la tardanza dicen que suele estar el peligro.
La menesterosa doncella pugnó, con mucha porfía, por besarle las manos, mas
don Quijote, que en todo era comedido y cortés caballero, jamás lo
consintió; antes, la hizo levantar y la abrazó con mucha cortesía y
comedimiento, y mandó a Sancho que requiriese las cinchas a Rocinante y le
armase luego al punto. Sancho descolgó las armas, que, como trofeo, de un
árbol estaban pendientes, y, requiriendo las cinchas, en un punto armó a su
señor; el cual, viéndose armado, dijo:
— Vamos de aquí, en el nombre de Dios, a favorecer esta gran señora.
Estábase el barbero aún de rodillas, teniendo gran cuenta de disimular la
risa y de que no se le cayese la barba, con cuya caída quizá quedaran todos
sin conseguir su buena intención; y, viendo que ya el don estaba concedido
y con la diligencia que don Quijote se alistaba para ir a cumplirle, se
levantó y tomó de la otra mano a su señora, y entre los dos la subieron en
la mula. Luego subió don Quijote sobre Rocinante, y el barbero se acomodó
en su cabalgadura, quedándose Sancho a pie, donde de nuevo se le renovó la
pérdida del rucio, con la falta que entonces le hacía; mas todo lo llevaba
con gusto, por parecerle que ya su señor estaba puesto en camino, y muy a
pique, de ser emperador; porque sin duda alguna pensaba que se había de
casar con aquella princesa, y ser, por lo menos, rey de Micomicón. Sólo le
daba pesadumbre el pensar que aquel reino era en tierra de negros, y que la
gente que por sus vasallos le diesen habían de ser todos negros; a lo cual
hizo luego en su imaginación un buen remedio, y díjose a sí mismo:
— ¿Qué se me da a mí que mis vasallos sean negros? ¿Habrá más que cargar con
ellos y traerlos a España, donde los podré vender, y adonde me los pagarán
de contado, de cuyo dinero podré comprar algún título o algún oficio con
que vivir descansado todos los días de mi vida? ¡No, sino dormíos, y no
tengáis ingenio ni habilidad para disponer de las cosas y para vender
treinta o diez mil vasallos en dácame esas pajas! Par Dios que los he de
volar, chico con grande, o como pudiere, y que, por negros que sean, los he
de volver blancos o amarillos. ¡Llegaos, que me mamo el dedo!
Con esto, andaba tan solícito y tan contento que se le olvidaba la
pesadumbre de caminar a pie.
Todo esto miraban de entre unas breñas Cardenio y el cura, y no sabían qué
hacerse para juntarse con ellos; pero el cura, que era gran tracista,
imaginó luego lo que harían para conseguir lo que deseaban; y fue que con
unas tijeras que traía en un estuche quitó con mucha presteza la barba a
Cardenio, y vistióle un capotillo pardo que él traía y diole un herreruelo
negro, y él se quedó en calzas y en jubón; y quedó tan otro de lo que antes
parecía Cardenio, que él mesmo no se conociera, aunque a un espejo se
mirara. Hecho esto, puesto ya que los otros habían pasado adelante en tanto
que ellos se disfrazaron, con facilidad salieron al camino real antes que
ellos, porque las malezas y malos pasos de aquellos lugares no concedían
que anduviesen tanto los de a caballo como los de a pie. En efeto, ellos se
pusieron en el llano, a la salida de la sierra, y, así como salió della don
Quijote y sus camaradas, el cura se le puso a mirar muy de espacio, dando
señales de que le iba reconociendo; y, al cabo de haberle una buena pieza
estado mirando, se fue a él abiertos los brazos y diciendo a voces:
— Para bien sea hallado el espejo de la caballería, el mi buen compatriote
don Quijote de la Mancha, la flor y la nata de la gentileza, el amparo y
remedio de los menesterosos, la quintaesencia de los caballeros andantes.
Y, diciendo esto, tenía abrazado por la rodilla de la pierna izquierda a
don Quijote; el cual, espantado de lo que veía y oía decir y hacer aquel
hombre, se le puso a mirar con atención, y, al fin, le conoció y quedó como
espantado de verle, y hizo grande fuerza por apearse; mas el cura no lo
consintió, por lo cual don Quijote decía:
— Déjeme vuestra merced, señor licenciado, que no es razón que yo esté a
caballo, y una tan reverenda persona como vuestra merced esté a pie.
— Eso no consentiré yo en ningún modo —dijo el cura—: estése la vuestra
grandeza a caballo, pues estando a caballo acaba las mayores fazañas y
aventuras que en nuestra edad se han visto; que a mí, aunque indigno
sacerdote, bastaráme subir en las ancas de una destas mulas destos señores
que con vuestra merced caminan, si no lo han por enojo. Y aun haré cuenta
que voy caballero sobre el caballo Pegaso, o sobre la cebra o alfana en que
cabalgaba aquel famoso moro Muzaraque, que aún hasta ahora yace encantado
en la gran cuesta Zulema, que dista poco de la gran Compluto.
— Aún no caía yo en tanto, mi señor licenciado —respondió don Quijote—; y yo
sé que mi señora la princesa será servida, por mi amor, de mandar a su
escudero dé a vuestra merced la silla de su mula, que él podrá acomodarse
en las ancas, si es que ella las sufre.
— Sí sufre, a lo que yo creo —respondió la princesa—; y también sé que no
será menester mandárselo al señor mi escudero, que él es tan cortés y tan
cortesano que no consentirá que una persona eclesiástica vaya a pie,
pudiendo ir a caballo.
— Así es —respondió el barbero.
Y, apeándose en un punto, convidó al cura con la silla, y él la tomó sin
hacerse mucho de rogar. Y fue el mal que al subir a las ancas el barbero,
la mula, que, en efeto, era de alquiler, que para decir que era mala esto
basta, alzó un poco los cuartos traseros y dio dos coces en el aire, que, a
darlas en el pecho de maese Nicolás, o en la cabeza, él diera al diablo la
venida por don Quijote. Con todo eso, le sobresaltaron de manera que cayó
en el suelo, con tan poco cuidado de las barbas, que se le cayeron en el
suelo; y, como se vio sin ellas, no tuvo otro remedio sino acudir a
cubrirse el rostro con ambas manos y a quejarse que le habían derribado las
muelas. Don Quijote, como vio todo aquel mazo de barbas, sin quijadas y sin
sangre, lejos del rostro del escudero caído, dijo:
— ¡Vive Dios, que es gran milagro éste! ¡Las barbas le ha derribado y
arrancado del rostro, como si las quitaran aposta!
El cura, que vio el peligro que corría su invención de ser descubierta,
acudió luego a las barbas y fuese con ellas adonde yacía maese Nicolás,
dando aún voces todavía, y de un golpe, llegándole la cabeza a su pecho, se
las puso, murmurando sobre él unas palabras, que dijo que era cierto
ensalmo apropiado para pegar barbas, como lo verían; y, cuando se las tuvo
puestas, se apartó, y quedó el escudero tan bien barbado y tan sano como de
antes, de que se admiró don Quijote sobremanera, y rogó al cura que cuando
tuviese lugar le enseñase aquel ensalmo; que él entendía que su virtud a
más que pegar barbas se debía de estender, pues estaba claro que de donde
las barbas se quitasen había de quedar la carne llagada y maltrecha, y que,
pues todo lo sanaba, a más que barbas aprovechaba.
— Así es —dijo el cura, y prometió de enseñársele en la primera ocasión.
Concertáronse que por entonces subiese el cura, y a trechos se fuesen los
tres mudando, hasta que llegasen a la venta, que estaría hasta dos leguas
de allí. Puestos los tres a caballo, es a saber, don Quijote, la princesa y
el cura, y los tres a pie, Cardenio, el barbero y Sancho Panza, don Quijote
dijo a la doncella:
— Vuestra grandeza, señora mía, guíe por donde más gusto le diere.
Y, antes que ella respondiese, dijo el licenciado:
— ¿Hacia qué reino quiere guiar la vuestra señoría? ¿Es, por ventura, hacia
el de Micomicón?; que sí debe de ser, o yo sé poco de reinos.
Ella, que estaba bien en todo, entendió que había de responder que sí; y
así, dijo:
— Sí, señor, hacia ese reino es mi camino.
— Si así es —dijo el cura—, por la mitad de mi pueblo hemos de pasar, y de
allí tomará vuestra merced la derrota de Cartagena, donde se podrá embarcar
con la buena ventura; y si hay viento próspero, mar tranquilo y sin
borrasca, en poco menos de nueve años se podrá estar a vista de la gran
laguna Meona, digo, Meótides, que está poco más de cien jornadas más acá
del reino de vuestra grandeza.
— Vuestra merced está engañado, señor mío —dijo ella—, porque no ha dos años
que yo partí dél, y en verdad que nunca tuve buen tiempo, y, con todo eso,
he llegado a ver lo que tanto deseaba, que es al señor don Quijote de la
Mancha, cuyas nuevas llegaron a mis oídos así como puse los pies en España,
y ellas me movieron a buscarle, para encomendarme en su cortesía y fiar mi
justicia del valor de su invencible brazo.
— No más: cesen mis alabanzas —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, porque soy
enemigo de todo género de adulación; y, aunque ésta no lo sea, todavía
ofenden mis castas orejas semejantes pláticas. Lo que yo sé decir, señora
mía, que ora tenga valor o no, el que tuviere o no tuviere se ha de emplear
en vuestro servicio hasta perder la vida; y así, dejando esto para su
tiempo, ruego al señor licenciado me diga qué es la causa que le ha traído
por estas partes, tan solo, y tan sin criados, y tan a la ligera, que me
pone espanto.
— A eso yo responderé con brevedad —respondió el cura—, porque sabrá vuestra
merced, señor don Quijote, que yo y maese Nicolás, nuestro amigo y nuestro
barbero, íbamos a Sevilla a cobrar cierto dinero que un pariente mío que ha
muchos años que pasó a Indias me había enviado, y no tan pocos que no pasan
de sesenta mil pesos ensayados, que es otro que tal; y, pasando ayer por
estos lugares, nos salieron al encuentro cuatro salteadores y nos quitaron
hasta las barbas; y de modo nos las quitaron, que le convino al barbero
ponérselas postizas; y aun a este mancebo que aquí va —señalando a
Cardenio— le pusieron como de nuevo. Y es lo bueno que es pública fama por
todos estos contornos que los que nos saltearon son de unos galeotes que
dicen que libertó, casi en este mesmo sitio, un hombre tan valiente que, a
pesar del comisario y de las guardas, los soltó a todos; y, sin duda
alguna, él debía de estar fuera de juicio, o debe de ser tan grande bellaco
como ellos, o algún hombre sin alma y sin conciencia, pues quiso soltar al
lobo entre las ovejas, a la raposa entre las gallinas, a la mosca entre la
miel; quiso defraudar la justicia, ir contra su rey y señor natural, pues
fue contra sus justos mandamientos. Quiso, digo, quitar a las galeras sus
pies, poner en alboroto a la Santa Hermandad, que había muchos años que
reposaba; quiso, finalmente, hacer un hecho por donde se pierda su alma y
no se gane su cuerpo.
Habíales contado Sancho al cura y al barbero la aventura de los galeotes,
que acabó su amo con tanta gloria suya, y por esto cargaba la mano el cura
refiriéndola, por ver lo que hacía o decía don Quijote; al cual se le
mudaba la color a cada palabra, y no osaba decir que él había sido el
libertador de aquella buena gente.
— Éstos, pues —dijo el cura—, fueron los que nos robaron; que Dios, por su
misericordia, se lo perdone al que no los dejó llevar al debido suplicio.
Capítulo XXX. Que trata del gracioso artificio y orden que se tuvo en sacar
a nuestro enamorado caballero de la asperísima penitencia en que se había
puesto
No hubo bien acabado el cura, cuando Sancho dijo:
— Pues mía fe, señor licenciado, el que hizo esa fazaña fue mi amo, y no
porque yo no le dije antes y le avisé que mirase lo que hacía, y que era
pecado darles libertad, porque todos iban allí por grandísimos bellacos.
— ¡Majadero! —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, a los caballeros andantes no
les toca ni atañe averiguar si los afligidos, encadenados y opresos que
encuentran por los caminos van de aquella manera, o están en aquella
angustia, por sus culpas o por sus gracias; sólo le toca ayudarles como a
menesterosos, poniendo los ojos en sus penas y no en sus bellaquerías. Yo
topé un rosario y sarta de gente mohína y desdichada, y hice con ellos lo
que mi religión me pide, y lo demás allá se avenga; y a quien mal le ha
parecido, salvo la santa dignidad del señor licenciado y su honrada
persona, digo que sabe poco de achaque de caballería, y que miente como un
hideputa y mal nacido; y esto le haré conocer con mi espada, donde más
largamente se contiene.
Y esto dijo afirmándose en los estribos y calándose el morrión; porque la
bacía de barbero, que a su cuenta era el yelmo de Mambrino, llevaba colgado
del arzón delantero, hasta adobarla del mal tratamiento que la hicieron los
galeotes.
Dorotea, que era discreta y de gran donaire, como quien ya sabía el
menguado humor de don Quijote y que todos hacían burla dél, sino Sancho
Panza, no quiso ser para menos, y, viéndole tan enojado, le dijo:
— Señor caballero, miémbresele a la vuestra merced el don que me tiene
prometido, y que, conforme a él, no puede entremeterse en otra aventura,
por urgente que sea; sosiegue vuestra merced el pecho, que si el señor
licenciado supiera que por ese invicto brazo habían sido librados los
galeotes, él se diera tres puntos en la boca, y aun se mordiera tres veces
la lengua, antes que haber dicho palabra que en despecho de vuestra merced
redundara.
— Eso juro yo bien —dijo el cura—, y aun me hubiera quitado un bigote.
— Yo callaré, señora mía —dijo don Quijote—, y reprimiré la justa cólera que
ya en mi pecho se había levantado, y iré quieto y pacífico hasta tanto que
os cumpla el don prometido; pero, en pago deste buen deseo, os suplico me
digáis, si no se os hace de mal, cuál es la vuestra cuita y cuántas,
quiénes y cuáles son las personas de quien os tengo de dar debida,
satisfecha y entera venganza.
— Eso haré yo de gana —respondió Dorotea—, si es que no os enfadan oír
lástimas y desgracias.
— No enfadará, señora mía —respondió don Quijote.
A lo que respondió Dorotea:
— Pues así es, esténme vuestras mercedes atentos.
No hubo ella dicho esto, cuando Cardenio y el barbero se le pusieron al
lado, deseosos de ver cómo fingía su historia la discreta Dorotea; y lo
mismo hizo Sancho, que tan engañado iba con ella como su amo. Y ella,
después de haberse puesto bien en la silla y prevenídose con toser y hacer
otros ademanes, con mucho donaire, comenzó a decir desta manera:
— «Primeramente, quiero que vuestras mercedes sepan, señores míos, que a mí
me llaman...»
Y detúvose aquí un poco, porque se le olvidó el nombre que el cura le había
puesto; pero él acudió al remedio, porque entendió en lo que reparaba, y
dijo:
— No es maravilla, señora mía, que la vuestra grandeza se turbe y empache
contando sus desventuras, que ellas suelen ser tales, que muchas veces
quitan la memoria a los que maltratan, de tal manera que aun de sus mesmos
nombres no se les acuerda, como han hecho con vuestra gran señoría, que se
ha olvidado que se llama la princesa Micomicona, legítima heredera del gran
reino Micomicón; y con este apuntamiento puede la vuestra grandeza reducir
ahora fácilmente a su lastimada memoria todo aquello que contar quisiere.
— Así es la verdad —respondió la doncella—, y desde aquí adelante creo que
no será menester apuntarme nada, que yo saldré a buen puerto con mi
verdadera historia. «La cual es que el rey mi padre, que se llama Tinacrio
el Sabidor, fue muy docto en esto que llaman el arte mágica, y alcanzó por
su ciencia que mi madre, que se llamaba la reina Jaramilla, había de morir
primero que él, y que de allí a poco tiempo él también había de pasar desta
vida y yo había de quedar huérfana de padre y madre. Pero decía él que no
le fatigaba tanto esto cuanto le ponía en confusión saber, por cosa muy
cierta, que un descomunal gigante, señor de una grande ínsula, que casi
alinda con nuestro reino, llamado Pandafilando de la Fosca Vista (porque es
cosa averiguada que, aunque tiene los ojos en su lugar y derechos, siempre
mira al revés, como si fuese bizco, y esto lo hace él de maligno y por
poner miedo y espanto a los que mira); digo que supo que este gigante, en
sabiendo mi orfandad, había de pasar con gran poderío sobre mi reino y me
lo había de quitar todo, sin dejarme una pequeña aldea donde me recogiese;
pero que podía escusar toda esta ruina y desgracia si yo me quisiese casar
con él; mas, a lo que él entendía, jamás pensaba que me vendría a mí en
voluntad de hacer tan desigual casamiento; y dijo en esto la pura verdad,
porque jamás me ha pasado por el pensamiento casarme con aquel gigante,
pero ni con otro alguno, por grande y desaforado que fuese. Dijo también mi
padre que, después que él fuese muerto y viese yo que Pandafilando
comenzaba a pasar sobre mi reino, que no aguardase a ponerme en defensa,
porque sería destruirme, sino que libremente le dejase desembarazado el
reino, si quería escusar la muerte y total destruición de mis buenos y
leales vasallos, porque no había de ser posible defenderme de la endiablada
fuerza del gigante; sino que luego, con algunos de los míos, me pusiese en
camino de las Españas, donde hallaría el remedio de mis males hallando a un
caballero andante, cuya fama en este tiempo se estendería por todo este
reino, el cual se había de llamar, si mal no me acuerdo, don Azote o don
Gigote.»
— Don Quijote diría, señora —dijo a esta sazón Sancho Panza—, o, por otro
nombre, el Caballero de la Triste Figura.
— Así es la verdad —dijo Dorotea—. «Dijo más: que había de ser alto de
cuerpo, seco de rostro, y que en el lado derecho, debajo del hombro
izquierdo, o por allí junto, había de tener un lunar pardo con ciertos
cabellos a manera de cerdas.»
En oyendo esto don Quijote, dijo a su escudero:
— Ten aquí, Sancho, hijo, ayúdame a desnudar, que quiero ver si soy el
caballero que aquel sabio rey dejó profetizado.
— Pues, ¿para qué quiere vuestra merced desnudarse? —dijo Dorotea.
— Para ver si tengo ese lunar que vuestro padre dijo —respondió don Quijote.
— No hay para qué desnudarse —dijo Sancho—, que yo sé que tiene vuestra
merced un lunar desas señas en la mitad del espinazo, que es señal de ser
hombre fuerte.
— Eso basta —dijo Dorotea—, porque con los amigos no se ha de mirar en pocas
cosas, y que esté en el hombro o que esté en el espinazo, importa poco;
basta que haya lunar, y esté donde estuviere, pues todo es una mesma carne;
y, sin duda, acertó mi buen padre en todo, y yo he acertado en encomendarme
al señor don Quijote, que él es por quien mi padre dijo, pues las señales
del rostro vienen con las de la buena fama que este caballero tiene no sólo
en España, pero en toda la Mancha, pues apenas me hube desembarcado en
Osuna, cuando oí decir tantas hazañas suyas, que luego me dio el alma que
era el mesmo que venía a buscar.
— Pues, ¿cómo se desembarcó vuestra merced en Osuna, señora mía —preguntó
don Quijote—, si no es puerto de mar?
Mas, antes que Dorotea respondiese, tomó el cura la mano y dijo:
— Debe de querer decir la señora princesa que, después que desembarcó en
Málaga, la primera parte donde oyó nuevas de vuestra merced fue en Osuna.
— Eso quise decir —dijo Dorotea.
— Y esto lleva camino —dijo el cura—, y prosiga vuestra majestad adelante.
— No hay que proseguir —respondió Dorotea—, sino que, finalmente, mi suerte
ha sido tan buena en hallar al señor don Quijote, que ya me cuento y tengo
por reina y señora de todo mi reino, pues él, por su cortesía y
magnificencia, me ha prometido el don de irse conmigo dondequiera que yo le
llevare, que no será a otra parte que a ponerle delante de Pandafilando de
la Fosca Vista, para que le mate y me restituya lo que tan contra razón me
tiene usurpado: que todo esto ha de suceder a pedir de boca, pues así lo
dejó profetizado Tinacrio el Sabidor, mi buen padre; el cual también dejó
dicho y escrito en letras caldeas, o griegas, que yo no las sé leer, que si
este caballero de la profecía, después de haber degollado al gigante,
quisiese casarse conmigo, que yo me otorgase luego sin réplica alguna por
su legítima esposa, y le diese la posesión de mi reino, junto con la de mi
persona.
— ¿Qué te parece, Sancho amigo? —dijo a este punto don Quijote—. ¿No oyes lo
que pasa? ¿No te lo dije yo? Mira si tenemos ya reino que mandar y reina
con quien casar.
— ¡Eso juro yo —dijo Sancho— para el puto que no se casare en abriendo el
gaznatico al señor Pandahilado! Pues, ¡monta que es mala la reina! ¡Así se
me vuelvan las pulgas de la cama!
Y, diciendo esto, dio dos zapatetas en el aire, con muestras de grandísimo
contento, y luego fue a tomar las riendas de la mula de Dorotea, y,
haciéndola detener, se hincó de rodillas ante ella, suplicándole le diese
las manos para besárselas, en señal que la recibía por su reina y señora.
¿Quién no había de reír de los circustantes, viendo la locura del amo y la
simplicidad del criado? En efecto, Dorotea se las dio, y le prometió de
hacerle gran señor en su reino, cuando el cielo le hiciese tanto bien que
se lo dejase cobrar y gozar. Agradecióselo Sancho con tales palabras que
renovó la risa en todos.
— Ésta, señores —prosiguió Dorotea—, es mi historia: sólo resta por deciros
que de cuanta gente de acompañamiento saqué de mi reino no me ha quedado
sino sólo este buen barbado escudero, porque todos se anegaron en una gran
borrasca que tuvimos a vista del puerto, y él y yo salimos en dos tablas a
tierra, como por milagro; y así, es todo milagro y misterio el discurso de
mi vida, como lo habréis notado. Y si en alguna cosa he andado demasiada, o
no tan acertada como debiera, echad la culpa a lo que el señor licenciado
dijo al principio de mi cuento: que los trabajos continuos y
extraordinarios quitan la memoria al que los padece.
— Ésa no me quitarán a mí, ¡oh alta y valerosa señora! —dijo don Quijote—,
cuantos yo pasare en serviros, por grandes y no vistos que sean; y así, de
nuevo confirmo el don que os he prometido, y juro de ir con vos al cabo del
mundo, hasta verme con el fiero enemigo vuestro, a quien pienso, con el
ayuda de Dios y de mi brazo, tajar la cabeza soberbia con los filos
desta... no quiero decir buena espada, merced a Ginés de Pasamonte, que me
llevó la mía.
Esto dijo entre dientes, y prosiguió diciendo:
— Y después de habérsela tajado y puéstoos en pacífica posesión de vuestro
estado, quedará a vuestra voluntad hacer de vuestra persona lo que más en
talante os viniere; porque, mientras que yo tuviere ocupada la memoria y
cautiva la voluntad, perdido el entendimiento, a aquella..., y no digo más,
no es posible que yo arrostre, ni por pienso, el casarme, aunque fuese con
el ave fénix.
Parecióle tan mal a Sancho lo que últimamente su amo dijo acerca de no
querer casarse, que, con grande enojo, alzando la voz, dijo:
— Voto a mí, y juro a mí, que no tiene vuestra merced, señor don Quijote,
cabal juicio. Pues, ¿cómo es posible que pone vuestra merced en duda el
casarse con tan alta princesa como aquésta? ¿Piensa que le ha de ofrecer la
fortuna, tras cada cantillo, semejante ventura como la que ahora se le
ofrece? ¿Es, por dicha, más hermosa mi señora Dulcinea? No, por cierto, ni
aun con la mitad, y aun estoy por decir que no llega a su zapato de la que
está delante. Así, noramala alcanzaré yo el condado que espero, si vuestra
merced se anda a pedir cotufas en el golfo. Cásese, cásese luego,
encomiéndole yo a Satanás, y tome ese reino que se le viene a las manos de
vobis, vobis, y, en siendo rey, hágame marqués o adelantado, y luego,
siquiera se lo lleve el diablo todo.
Don Quijote, que tales blasfemias oyó decir contra su señora Dulcinea, no
lo pudo sufrir, y, alzando el lanzón, sin hablalle palabra a Sancho y sin
decirle esta boca es mía, le dio tales dos palos que dio con él en tierra;
y si no fuera porque Dorotea le dio voces que no le diera más, sin duda le
quitara allí la vida.
— ¿Pensáis —le dijo a cabo de rato—, villano ruin, que ha de haber lugar
siempre para ponerme la mano en la horcajadura, y que todo ha de ser errar
vos y perdonaros yo? Pues no lo penséis, bellaco descomulgado, que sin duda
lo estás, pues has puesto lengua en la sin par Dulcinea. ¿Y no sabéis vos,
gañán, faquín, belitre, que si no fuese por el valor que ella infunde en mi
brazo, que no le tendría yo para matar una pulga? Decid, socarrón de lengua
viperina, ¿y quién pensáis que ha ganado este reino y cortado la cabeza a
este gigante, y héchoos a vos marqués, que todo esto doy ya por hecho y por
cosa pasada en cosa juzgada, si no es el valor de Dulcinea, tomando a mi
brazo por instrumento de sus hazañas? Ella pelea en mí, y vence en mí, y yo
vivo y respiro en ella, y tengo vida y ser. ¡Oh hideputa bellaco, y cómo
sois desagradecido: que os veis levantado del polvo de la tierra a ser
señor de título, y correspondéis a tan buena obra con decir mal de quien os
la hizo!
No estaba tan maltrecho Sancho que no oyese todo cuanto su amo le decía, y,
levantándose con un poco de presteza, se fue a poner detrás del palafrén de
Dorotea, y desde allí dijo a su amo:
— Dígame, señor: si vuestra merced tiene determinado de no casarse con esta
gran princesa, claro está que no será el reino suyo; y, no siéndolo, ¿qué
mercedes me puede hacer? Esto es de lo que yo me quejo; cásese vuestra
merced una por una con esta reina, ahora que la tenemos aquí como llovida
del cielo, y después puede volverse con mi señora Dulcinea; que reyes debe
de haber habido en el mundo que hayan sido amancebados. En lo de la
hermosura no me entremeto; que, en verdad, si va a decirla, que entrambas
me parecen bien, puesto que yo nunca he visto a la señora Dulcinea.
— ¿Cómo que no la has visto, traidor blasfemo? —dijo don Quijote—. Pues, ¿no
acabas de traerme ahora un recado de su parte?
— Digo que no la he visto tan despacio —dijo Sancho— que pueda haber notado
particularmente su hermosura y sus buenas partes punto por punto; pero así,
a bulto, me parece bien.
— Ahora te disculpo —dijo don Quijote—, y perdóname el enojo que te he dado,
que los primeros movimientos no son en manos de los hombres.
— Ya yo lo veo —respondió Sancho—; y así, en mí la gana de hablar siempre es
primero movimiento, y no puedo dejar de decir, por una vez siquiera, lo que
me viene a la lengua.
— Con todo eso —dijo don Quijote—, mira, Sancho, lo que hablas, porque
tantas veces va el cantarillo a la fuente..., y no te digo más.
— Ahora bien —respondió Sancho—, Dios está en el cielo, que ve las trampas,
y será juez de quién hace más mal: yo en no hablar bien, o vuestra merced
en obrallo.
— No haya más —dijo Dorotea—: corred, Sancho, y besad la mano a vuestro
señor, y pedilde perdón, y de aquí adelante andad más atentado en vuestras
alabanzas y vituperios, y no digáis mal de aquesa señora Tobosa, a quien yo
no conozco si no es para servilla, y tened confianza en Dios, que no os ha
de faltar un estado donde viváis como un príncipe.
Fue Sancho cabizbajo y pidió la mano a su señor, y él se la dio con
reposado continente; y, después que se la hubo besado, le echó la
bendición, y dijo a Sancho que se adelantasen un poco, que tenía que
preguntalle y que departir con él cosas de mucha importancia. Hízolo así
Sancho y apartáronse los dos algo adelante, y díjole don Quijote:
— Después que veniste, no he tenido lugar ni espacio para preguntarte muchas
cosas de particularidad acerca de la embajada que llevaste y de la
respuesta que trujiste; y ahora, pues la fortuna nos ha concedido tiempo y
lugar, no me niegues tú la ventura que puedes darme con tan buenas nuevas.
— Pregunte vuestra merced lo que quisiere —respondió Sancho—, que a todo
daré tan buena salida como tuve la entrada. Pero suplico a vuestra merced,
señor mío, que no sea de aquí adelante tan vengativo.
— ¿Por qué lo dices, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote.
— Dígolo —respondió— porque estos palos de agora más fueron por la pendencia
que entre los dos trabó el diablo la otra noche, que por lo que dije contra
mi señora Dulcinea, a quien amo y reverencio como a una reliquia, aunque en
ella no lo haya, sólo por ser cosa de vuestra merced.
— No tornes a esas pláticas, Sancho, por tu vida —dijo don Quijote—, que me
dan pesadumbre; ya te perdoné entonces, y bien sabes tú que suele decirse:
a pecado nuevo, penitencia nueva.
En tanto que los dos iban en estas pláticas, dijo el cura a Dorotea que
había andado muy discreta, así en el cuento como en la brevedad dél, y en
la similitud que tuvo con los de los libros de caballerías. Ella dijo que
muchos ratos se había entretenido en leellos, pero que no sabía ella dónde
eran las provincias ni puertos de mar, y que así había dicho a tiento que
se había desembarcado en Osuna.
— Yo lo entendí así —dijo el cura—, y por eso acudí luego a decir lo que
dije, con que se acomodó todo. Pero, ¿no es cosa estraña ver con cuánta
facilidad cree este desventurado hidalgo todas estas invenciones y
mentiras, sólo porque llevan el estilo y modo de las necedades de sus
libros?
— Sí es —dijo Cardenio—, y tan rara y nunca vista, que yo no sé si queriendo
inventarla y fabricarla mentirosamente, hubiera tan agudo ingenio que
pudiera dar en ella.
— Pues otra cosa hay en ello —dijo el cura—: que fuera de las simplicidades
que este buen hidalgo dice tocantes a su locura, si le tratan de otras
cosas, discurre con bonísimas razones y muestra tener un entendimiento
claro y apacible en todo. De manera que, como no le toquen en sus
caballerías, no habrá nadie que le juzgue sino por de muy buen
entendimiento.
En tanto que ellos iban en esta conversación, prosiguió don Quijote con la
suya y dijo a Sancho:
— Echemos, Panza amigo, pelillos a la mar en esto de nuestras pendencias, y
dime ahora, sin tener cuenta con enojo ni rencor alguno: ¿Dónde, cómo y
cuándo hallaste a Dulcinea? ¿Qué hacía? ¿Qué le dijiste? ¿Qué te respondió?
¿Qué rostro hizo cuando leía mi carta? ¿Quién te la trasladó? Y todo
aquello que vieres que en este caso es digno de saberse, de preguntarse y
satisfacerse, sin que añadas o mientas por darme gusto, ni menos te acortes
por no quitármele.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, si va a decir la verdad, la carta no me la
trasladó nadie, porque yo no llevé carta alguna.
— Así es como tú dices —dijo don Quijote—, porque el librillo de memoria
donde yo la escribí le hallé en mi poder a cabo de dos días de tu partida,
lo cual me causó grandísima pena, por no saber lo que habías tú de hacer
cuando te vieses sin carta, y creí siempre que te volvieras desde el lugar
donde la echaras menos.
— Así fuera —respondió Sancho—, si no la hubiera yo tomado en la memoria
cuando vuestra merced me la leyó, de manera que se la dije a un sacristán,
que me la trasladó del entendimiento, tan punto por punto, que dijo que en
todos los días de su vida, aunque había leído muchas cartas de descomunión,
no había visto ni leído tan linda carta como aquélla.
— Y ¿tiénesla todavía en la memoria, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote.
— No, señor —respondió Sancho—, porque después que la di, como vi que no
había de ser de más provecho, di en olvidalla. Y si algo se me acuerda, es
aquello del sobajada, digo, del soberana señora, y lo último: Vuestro hasta
la muerte, el Caballero de la Triste Figura. Y, en medio destas dos cosas,
le puse más de trecientas almas, y vidas, y ojos míos.
Capítulo XXXI. De los sabrosos razonamientos que pasaron entre don Quijote
y Sancho Panza, su escudero, con otros sucesos
— Todo eso no me descontenta; prosigue adelante —dijo don Quijote—.
Llegaste, ¿y qué hacía aquella reina de la hermosura? A buen seguro que la
hallaste ensartando perlas, o bordando alguna empresa con oro de cañutillo
para este su cautivo caballero.
— No la hallé —respondió Sancho— sino ahechando dos hanegas de trigo en un
corral de su casa.
— Pues haz cuenta —dijo don Quijote— que los granos de aquel trigo eran
granos de perlas, tocados de sus manos. Y si miraste, amigo, el trigo ¿era
candeal, o trechel?
— No era sino rubión —respondió Sancho.
— Pues yo te aseguro —dijo don Quijote— que, ahechado por sus manos, hizo
pan candeal, sin duda alguna. Pero pasa adelante: cuando le diste mi carta,
¿besóla? ¿Púsosela sobre la cabeza? ¿Hizo alguna ceremonia digna de tal
carta, o qué hizo?
— Cuando yo se la iba a dar —respondió Sancho—, ella estaba en la fuga del
meneo de una buena parte de trigo que tenía en la criba, y díjome: ''Poned,
amigo, esa carta sobre aquel costal, que no la puedo leer hasta que acabe
de acribar todo lo que aquí está''.
— ¡Discreta señora! —dijo don Quijote—. Eso debió de ser por leerla despacio
y recrearse con ella. Adelante, Sancho: y, en tanto que estaba en su
menester, ¿qué coloquios pasó contigo? ¿Qué te preguntó de mí? Y tú, ¿qué
le respondiste? Acaba, cuéntamelo todo; no se te quede en el tintero una
mínima.
— Ella no me preguntó nada —dijo Sancho—, mas yo le dije de la manera que
vuestra merced, por su servicio, quedaba haciendo penitencia, desnudo de la
cintura arriba, metido entre estas sierras como si fuera salvaje, durmiendo
en el suelo, sin comer pan a manteles ni sin peinarse la barba, llorando y
maldiciendo su fortuna.
— En decir que maldecía mi fortuna dijiste mal —dijo don Quijote—, porque
antes la bendigo y bendeciré todos los días de mi vida, por haberme hecho
digno de merecer amar tan alta señora como Dulcinea del Toboso.
— Tan alta es —respondió Sancho—, que a buena fe que me lleva a mí más de un
coto.
— Pues, ¿cómo, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote—. ¿Haste medido tú con ella?
— Medíme en esta manera —respondió Sancho—: que, llegándole a ayudar a poner
un costal de trigo sobre un jumento, llegamos tan juntos que eché de ver
que me llevaba más de un gran palmo.
— Pues ¡es verdad —replicó don Quijote— que no acompaña esa grandeza y la
adorna con mil millones y gracias del alma! Pero no me negarás, Sancho, una
cosa: cuando llegaste junto a ella, ¿no sentiste un olor sabeo, una
fragancia aromática, y un no sé qué de bueno, que yo no acierto a dalle
nombre? Digo, ¿un tuho o tufo como si estuvieras en la tienda de algún
curioso guantero?
— Lo que sé decir —dijo Sancho— es que sentí un olorcillo algo hombruno; y
debía de ser que ella, con el mucho ejercicio, estaba sudada y algo
correosa.
— No sería eso —respondió don Quijote—, sino que tú debías de estar
romadizado, o te debiste de oler a ti mismo; porque yo sé bien a lo que
huele aquella rosa entre espinas, aquel lirio del campo, aquel ámbar
desleído.
— Todo puede ser —respondió Sancho—, que muchas veces sale de mí aquel olor
que entonces me pareció que salía de su merced de la señora Dulcinea; pero
no hay de qué maravillarse, que un diablo parece a otro.
— Y bien —prosiguió don Quijote—, he aquí que acabó de limpiar su trigo y de
enviallo al molino. ¿Qué hizo cuando leyó la carta?
— La carta —dijo Sancho— no la leyó, porque dijo que no sabía leer ni
escribir; antes, la rasgó y la hizo menudas piezas, diciendo que no la
quería dar a leer a nadie, porque no se supiesen en el lugar sus secretos,
y que bastaba lo que yo le había dicho de palabra acerca del amor que
vuestra merced le tenía y de la penitencia extraordinaria que por su causa
quedaba haciendo. Y, finalmente, me dijo que dijese a vuestra merced que le
besaba las manos, y que allí quedaba con más deseo de verle que de
escribirle; y que, así, le suplicaba y mandaba que, vista la presente,
saliese de aquellos matorrales y se dejase de hacer disparates, y se
pusiese luego luego en camino del Toboso, si otra cosa de más importancia
no le sucediese, porque tenía gran deseo de ver a vuestra merced. Rióse
mucho cuando le dije como se llamaba vuestra merced el Caballero de la
Triste Figura. Preguntéle si había ido allá el vizcaíno de marras; díjome
que sí, y que era un hombre muy de bien. También le pregunté por los
galeotes, mas díjome que no había visto hasta entonces alguno.
— Todo va bien hasta agora —dijo don Quijote—. Pero dime: ¿qué joya fue la
que te dio, al despedirte, por las nuevas que de mí le llevaste? Porque es
usada y antigua costumbre entre los caballeros y damas andantes dar a los
escuderos, doncellas o enanos que les llevan nuevas, de sus damas a ellos,
a ellas de sus andantes, alguna rica joya en albricias, en agradecimiento
de su recado.
— Bien puede eso ser así, y yo la tengo por buena usanza; pero eso debió de
ser en los tiempos pasados, que ahora sólo se debe de acostumbrar a dar un
pedazo de pan y queso, que esto fue lo que me dio mi señora Dulcinea, por
las bardas de un corral, cuando della me despedí; y aun, por más señas, era
el queso ovejuno.
— Es liberal en estremo —dijo don Quijote—, y si no te dio joya de oro, sin
duda debió de ser porque no la tendría allí a la mano para dártela; pero
buenas son mangas después de Pascua: yo la veré, y se satisfará todo.
¿Sabes de qué estoy maravillado, Sancho? De que me parece que fuiste y
veniste por los aires, pues poco más de tres días has tardado en ir y venir
desde aquí al Toboso, habiendo de aquí allá más de treinta leguas; por lo
cual me doy a entender que aquel sabio nigromante que tiene cuenta con mis
cosas y es mi amigo (porque por fuerza le hay, y le ha de haber, so pena
que yo no sería buen caballero andante); digo que este tal te debió de
ayudar a caminar, sin que tú lo sintieses; que hay sabio déstos que coge a
un caballero andante durmiendo en su cama, y, sin saber cómo o en qué
manera, amanece otro día más de mil leguas de donde anocheció. Y si no
fuese por esto, no se podrían socorrer en sus peligros los caballeros
andantes unos a otros, como se socorren a cada paso. Que acaece estar uno
peleando en las sierras de Armenia con algún endriago, o con algún fiero
vestiglo, o con otro caballero, donde lleva lo peor de la batalla y está ya
a punto de muerte, y cuando no os me cato, asoma por acullá, encima de una
nube, o sobre un carro de fuego, otro caballero amigo suyo, que poco antes
se hallaba en Ingalaterra, que le favorece y libra de la muerte, y a la
noche se halla en su posada, cenando muy a su sabor; y suele haber de la
una a la otra parte dos o tres mil leguas. Y todo esto se hace por
industria y sabiduría destos sabios encantadores que tienen cuidado destos
valerosos caballeros. Así que, amigo Sancho, no se me hace dificultoso
creer que en tan breve tiempo hayas ido y venido desde este lugar al del
Toboso, pues, como tengo dicho, algún sabio amigo te debió de llevar en
volandillas, sin que tú lo sintieses.
— Así sería —dijo Sancho—; porque a buena fe que andaba Rocinante como si
fuera asno de gitano con azogue en los oídos.
— Y ¡cómo si llevaba azogue! —dijo don Quijote—, y aun una legión de
demonios, que es gente que camina y hace caminar, sin cansarse, todo
aquello que se les antoja. Pero, dejando esto aparte, ¿qué te parece a ti
que debo yo de hacer ahora cerca de lo que mi señora me manda que la vaya a
ver?; que, aunque yo veo que estoy obligado a cumplir su mandamiento, véome
también imposibilitado del don que he prometido a la princesa que con
nosotros viene, y fuérzame la ley de caballería a cumplir mi palabra antes
que mi gusto. Por una parte, me acosa y fatiga el deseo de ver a mi señora;
por otra, me incita y llama la prometida fe y la gloria que he de alcanzar
en esta empresa. Pero lo que pienso hacer será caminar apriesa y llegar
presto donde está este gigante, y, en llegando, le cortaré la cabeza, y
pondré a la princesa pacíficamente en su estado, y al punto daré la vuelta
a ver a la luz que mis sentidos alumbra, a la cual daré tales disculpas que
ella venga a tener por buena mi tardanza, pues verá que todo redunda en
aumento de su gloria y fama, pues cuanta yo he alcanzado, alcanzo y
alcanzare por las armas en esta vida, toda me viene del favor que ella me
da y de ser yo suyo.
— ¡Ay —dijo Sancho—, y cómo está vuestra merced lastimado de esos cascos!
Pues dígame, señor: ¿piensa vuestra merced caminar este camino en balde, y
dejar pasar y perder un tan rico y tan principal casamiento como éste,
donde le dan en dote un reino, que a buena verdad que he oído decir que
tiene más de veinte mil leguas de contorno, y que es abundantísimo de todas
las cosas que son necesarias para el sustento de la vida humana, y que es
mayor que Portugal y que Castilla juntos? Calle, por amor de Dios, y tenga
vergüenza de lo que ha dicho, y tome mi consejo, y perdóneme, y cásese
luego en el primer lugar que haya cura; y si no, ahí está nuestro
licenciado, que lo hará de perlas. Y advierta que ya tengo edad para dar
consejos, y que este que le doy le viene de molde, y que más vale pájaro en
mano que buitre volando, porque quien bien tiene y mal escoge, por bien que
se enoja no se venga.
— Mira, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—: si el consejo que me das de que me
case es porque sea luego rey, en matando al gigante, y tenga cómodo para
hacerte mercedes y darte lo prometido, hágote saber que sin casarme podré
cumplir tu deseo muy fácilmente, porque yo sacaré de adahala, antes de
entrar en la batalla, que, saliendo vencedor della, ya que no me case, me
han de dar una parte del reino, para que la pueda dar a quien yo quisiere;
y, en dándomela, ¿a quién quieres tú que la dé sino a ti?
— Eso está claro —respondió Sancho—, pero mire vuestra merced que la escoja
hacia la marina, porque, si no me contentare la vivienda, pueda embarcar
mis negros vasallos y hacer dellos lo que ya he dicho. Y vuestra merced no
se cure de ir por agora a ver a mi señora Dulcinea, sino váyase a matar al
gigante, y concluyamos este negocio; que por Dios que se me asienta que ha
de ser de mucha honra y de mucho provecho.
— Dígote, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que estás en lo cierto, y que habré de
tomar tu consejo en cuanto el ir antes con la princesa que a ver a
Dulcinea. Y avísote que no digas nada a nadie, ni a los que con nosotros
vienen, de lo que aquí hemos departido y tratado; que, pues Dulcinea es tan
recatada que no quiere que se sepan sus pensamientos, no será bien que yo,
ni otro por mí, los descubra.
— Pues si eso es así —dijo Sancho—, ¿cómo hace vuestra merced que todos los
que vence por su brazo se vayan a presentar ante mi señora Dulcinea, siendo
esto firma de su nombre que la quiere bien y que es su enamorado? Y, siendo
forzoso que los que fueren se han de ir a hincar de finojos ante su
presencia, y decir que van de parte de vuestra merced a dalle la
obediencia, ¿cómo se pueden encubrir los pensamientos de entrambos?
— ¡Oh, qué necio y qué simple que eres! —dijo don Quijote—. ¿Tú no ves,
Sancho, que eso todo redunda en su mayor ensalzamiento? Porque has de saber
que en este nuestro estilo de caballería es gran honra tener una dama
muchos caballeros andantes que la sirvan, sin que se estiendan más sus
pensamientos que a servilla, por sólo ser ella quien es, sin esperar otro
premio de sus muchos y buenos deseos, sino que ella se contente de
acetarlos por sus caballeros.
— Con esa manera de amor —dijo Sancho— he oído yo predicar que se ha de amar
a Nuestro Señor, por sí solo, sin que nos mueva esperanza de gloria o temor
de pena. Aunque yo le querría amar y servir por lo que pudiese.
— ¡Válate el diablo por villano —dijo don Quijote—, y qué de discreciones
dices a las veces! No parece sino que has estudiado.
— Pues a fe mía que no sé leer —respondió Sancho.
En esto, les dio voces maese Nicolás que esperasen un poco, que querían
detenerse a beber en una fontecilla que allí estaba. Detúvose don Quijote,
con no poco gusto de Sancho, que ya estaba cansado de mentir tanto y temía
no le cogiese su amo a palabras; porque, puesto que él sabía que Dulcinea
era una labradora del Toboso, no la había visto en toda su vida.
Habíase en este tiempo vestido Cardenio los vestidos que Dorotea traía
cuando la hallaron, que, aunque no eran muy buenos, hacían mucha ventaja a
los que dejaba. Apeáronse junto a la fuente, y con lo que el cura se
acomodó en la venta satisficieron, aunque poco, la mucha hambre que todos
traían.
Estando en esto, acertó a pasar por allí un muchacho que iba de camino, el
cual, poniéndose a mirar con mucha atención a los que en la fuente estaban,
de allí a poco arremetió a don Quijote, y, abrazándole por las piernas,
comenzó a llorar muy de propósito, diciendo:
— ¡Ay, señor mío! ¿No me conoce vuestra merced? Pues míreme bien, que yo soy
aquel mozo Andrés que quitó vuestra merced de la encina donde estaba atado.
Reconocióle don Quijote, y, asiéndole por la mano, se volvió a los que allí
estaban y dijo:
— Porque vean vuestras mercedes cuán de importancia es haber caballeros
andantes en el mundo, que desfagan los tuertos y agravios que en él se
hacen por los insolentes y malos hombres que en él viven, sepan vuestras
mercedes que los días pasados, pasando yo por un bosque, oí unos gritos y
unas voces muy lastimosas, como de persona afligida y menesterosa; acudí
luego, llevado de mi obligación, hacia la parte donde me pareció que las
lamentables voces sonaban, y hallé atado a una encina a este muchacho que
ahora está delante (de lo que me huelgo en el alma, porque será testigo que
no me dejará mentir en nada); digo que estaba atado a la encina, desnudo
del medio cuerpo arriba, y estábale abriendo a azotes con las riendas de
una yegua un villano, que después supe que era amo suyo; y, así como yo le
vi, le pregunté la causa de tan atroz vapulamiento; respondió el zafio que
le azotaba porque era su criado, y que ciertos descuidos que tenía nacían
más de ladrón que de simple; a lo cual este niño dijo: ''Señor, no me azota
sino porque le pido mi salario''. El amo replicó no sé qué arengas y
disculpas, las cuales, aunque de mí fueron oídas, no fueron admitidas. En
resolución, yo le hice desatar, y tomé juramento al villano de que le
llevaría consigo y le pagaría un real sobre otro, y aun sahumados. ¿No es
verdad todo esto, hijo Andrés? ¿No notaste con cuánto imperio se lo mandé,
y con cuánta humildad prometió de hacer todo cuanto yo le impuse, y
notifiqué y quise? Responde; no te turbes ni dudes en nada: di lo que pasó
a estos señores, porque se vea y considere ser del provecho que digo haber
caballeros andantes por los caminos.
— Todo lo que vuestra merced ha dicho es mucha verdad —respondió el
muchacho—, pero el fin del negocio sucedió muy al revés de lo que vuestra
merced se imagina.
— ¿Cómo al revés? —replicó don Quijote—; luego, ¿no te pagó el villano?
— No sólo no me pagó —respondió el muchacho—, pero, así como vuestra merced
traspuso del bosque y quedamos solos, me volvió a atar a la mesma encina, y
me dio de nuevo tantos azotes que quedé hecho un San Bartolomé desollado;
y, a cada azote que me daba, me decía un donaire y chufeta acerca de hacer
burla de vuestra merced, que, a no sentir yo tanto dolor, me riera de lo
que decía. En efeto: él me paró tal, que hasta ahora he estado curándome en
un hospital del mal que el mal villano entonces me hizo. De todo lo cual
tiene vuestra merced la culpa, porque si se fuera su camino adelante y no
viniera donde no le llamaban, ni se entremetiera en negocios ajenos, mi amo
se contentara con darme una o dos docenas de azotes, y luego me soltara y
pagara cuanto me debía. Mas, como vuestra merced le deshonró tan sin
propósito y le dijo tantas villanías, encendiósele la cólera, y, como no la
pudo vengar en vuestra merced, cuando se vio solo descargó sobre mí el
nublado, de modo que me parece que no seré más hombre en toda mi vida.
— El daño estuvo —dijo don Quijote— en irme yo de allí; que no me había de
ir hasta dejarte pagado, porque bien debía yo de saber, por luengas
experiencias, que no hay villano que guarde palabra que tiene, si él vee
que no le está bien guardalla. Pero ya te acuerdas, Andrés, que yo juré que
si no te pagaba, que había de ir a buscarle, y que le había de hallar,
aunque se escondiese en el vientre de la ballena.
— Así es la verdad —dijo Andrés—, pero no aprovechó nada.
— Ahora verás si aprovecha —dijo don Quijote.
Y, diciendo esto, se levantó muy apriesa y mandó a Sancho que enfrenase a
Rocinante, que estaba paciendo en tanto que ellos comían.
Preguntóle Dorotea qué era lo que hacer quería. Él le respondió que quería
ir a buscar al villano y castigalle de tan mal término, y hacer pagado a
Andrés hasta el último maravedí, a despecho y pesar de cuantos villanos
hubiese en el mundo. A lo que ella respondió que advirtiese que no podía,
conforme al don prometido, entremeterse en ninguna empresa hasta acabar la
suya; y que, pues esto sabía él mejor que otro alguno, que sosegase el
pecho hasta la vuelta de su reino.
— Así es verdad —respondió don Quijote—, y es forzoso que Andrés tenga
paciencia hasta la vuelta, como vos, señora, decís; que yo le torno a jurar
y a prometer de nuevo de no parar hasta hacerle vengado y pagado.
— No me creo desos juramentos —dijo Andrés—; más quisiera tener agora con
qué llegar a Sevilla que todas las venganzas del mundo: déme, si tiene ahí,
algo que coma y lleve, y quédese con Dios su merced y todos los caballeros
andantes; que tan bien andantes sean ellos para consigo como lo han sido
para conmigo.
Sacó de su repuesto Sancho un pedazo de pan y otro de queso, y, dándoselo
al mozo, le dijo:
— Tomá, hermano Andrés, que a todos nos alcanza parte de vuestra desgracia.
— Pues, ¿qué parte os alcanza a vos? —preguntó Andrés.
— Esta parte de queso y pan que os doy —respondió Sancho—, que Dios sabe si
me ha de hacer falta o no; porque os hago saber, amigo, que los escuderos
de los caballeros andantes estamos sujetos a mucha hambre y a mala ventura,
y aun a otras cosas que se sienten mejor que se dicen.
Andrés asió de su pan y queso, y, viendo que nadie le daba otra cosa, abajó
su cabeza y tomó el camino en las manos, como suele decirse. Bien es verdad
que, al partirse, dijo a don Quijote:
— Por amor de Dios, señor caballero andante, que si otra vez me encontrare,
aunque vea que me hacen pedazos, no me socorra ni ayude, sino déjeme con mi
desgracia; que no será tanta, que no sea mayor la que me vendrá de su ayuda
de vuestra merced, a quien Dios maldiga, y a todos cuantos caballeros
andantes han nacido en el mundo.
Íbase a levantar don Quijote para castigalle, mas él se puso a correr de
modo que ninguno se atrevió a seguille. Quedó corridísimo don Quijote del
cuento de Andrés, y fue menester que los demás tuviesen mucha cuenta con no
reírse, por no acaballe de correr del todo.
Capítulo XXXII. Que trata de lo que sucedió en la venta a toda la cuadrilla
de don Quijote
Acabóse la buena comida, ensillaron luego, y, sin que les sucediese cosa
digna de contar, llegaron otro día a la venta, espanto y asombro de Sancho
Panza; y, aunque él quisiera no entrar en ella, no lo pudo huir. La
ventera, ventero, su hija y Maritornes, que vieron venir a don Quijote y a
Sancho, les salieron a recebir con muestras de mucha alegría, y él las
recibió con grave continente y aplauso, y díjoles que le aderezasen otro
mejor lecho que la vez pasada; a lo cual le respondió la huéspeda que como
la pagase mejor que la otra vez, que ella se la daría de príncipes. Don
Quijote dijo que sí haría, y así, le aderezaron uno razonable en el mismo
caramanchón de marras, y él se acostó luego, porque venía muy quebrantado y
falto de juicio.
No se hubo bien encerrado, cuando la huéspeda arremetió al barbero, y,
asiéndole de la barba, dijo:
— Para mi santiguada, que no se ha aún de aprovechar más de mi rabo para su
barba, y que me ha de volver mi cola; que anda lo de mi marido por esos
suelos, que es vergüenza; digo, el peine, que solía yo colgar de mi buena
cola.
No se la quería dar el barbero, aunque ella más tiraba, hasta que el
licenciado le dijo que se la diese, que ya no era menester más usar de
aquella industria, sino que se descubriese y mostrase en su misma forma, y
dijese a don Quijote que cuando le despojaron los ladrones galeotes se
habían venido a aquella venta huyendo; y que si preguntase por el escudero
de la princesa, le dirían que ella le había enviado adelante a dar aviso a
los de su reino como ella iba y llevaba consigo el libertador de todos. Con
esto, dio de buena gana la cola a la ventera el barbero, y asimismo le
volvieron todos los adherentes que había prestado para la libertad de don
Quijote. Espantáronse todos los de la venta de la hermosura de Dorotea, y
aun del buen talle del zagal Cardenio. Hizo el cura que les aderezasen de
comer de lo que en la venta hubiese, y el huésped, con esperanza de mejor
paga, con diligencia les aderezó una razonable comida; y a todo esto dormía
don Quijote, y fueron de parecer de no despertalle, porque más provecho le
haría por entonces el dormir que el comer.
Trataron sobre comida, estando delante el ventero, su mujer, su hija,
Maritornes, todos los pasajeros, de la estraña locura de don Quijote y del
modo que le habían hallado. La huéspeda les contó lo que con él y con el
arriero les había acontecido, y, mirando si acaso estaba allí Sancho, como
no le viese, contó todo lo de su manteamiento, de que no poco gusto
recibieron. Y, como el cura dijese que los libros de caballerías que don
Quijote había leído le habían vuelto el juicio, dijo el ventero:
— No sé yo cómo puede ser eso; que en verdad que, a lo que yo entiendo, no
hay mejor letrado en el mundo, y que tengo ahí dos o tres dellos, con otros
papeles, que verdaderamente me han dado la vida, no sólo a mí, sino a otros
muchos. Porque, cuando es tiempo de la siega, se recogen aquí, las fiestas,
muchos segadores, y siempre hay algunos que saben leer, el cual coge uno
destos libros en las manos, y rodeámonos dél más de treinta, y estámosle
escuchando con tanto gusto que nos quita mil canas; a lo menos, de mí sé
decir que cuando oyo decir aquellos furibundos y terribles golpes que los
caballeros pegan, que me toma gana de hacer otro tanto, y que querría estar
oyéndolos noches y días.
— Y yo ni más ni menos —dijo la ventera—, porque nunca tengo buen rato en mi
casa sino aquel que vos estáis escuchando leer: que estáis tan embobado,
que no os acordáis de reñir por entonces.
— Así es la verdad —dijo Maritornes—, y a buena fe que yo también gusto
mucho de oír aquellas cosas, que son muy lindas; y más, cuando cuentan que
se está la otra señora debajo de unos naranjos abrazada con su caballero, y
que les está una dueña haciéndoles la guarda, muerta de envidia y con mucho
sobresalto. Digo que todo esto es cosa de mieles.
— Y a vos ¿qué os parece, señora doncella? —dijo el cura, hablando con la
hija del ventero.
— No sé, señor, en mi ánima —respondió ella—; también yo lo escucho, y en
verdad que, aunque no lo entiendo, que recibo gusto en oíllo; pero no gusto
yo de los golpes de que mi padre gusta, sino de las lamentaciones que los
caballeros hacen cuando están ausentes de sus señoras: que en verdad que
algunas veces me hacen llorar de compasión que les tengo.
— Luego, ¿bien las remediárades vos, señora doncella —dijo Dorotea—, si por
vos lloraran?
— No sé lo que me hiciera —respondió la moza—; sólo sé que hay algunas
señoras de aquéllas tan crueles, que las llaman sus caballeros tigres y
leones y otras mil inmundicias. Y, ¡Jesús!, yo no sé qué gente es aquélla
tan desalmada y tan sin conciencia, que por no mirar a un hombre honrado,
le dejan que se muera, o que se vuelva loco. Yo no sé para qué es tanto
melindre: si lo hacen de honradas, cásense con ellos, que ellos no desean
otra cosa.
— Calla, niña —dijo la ventera—, que parece que sabes mucho destas cosas, y
no está bien a las doncellas saber ni hablar tanto.
— Como me lo pregunta este señor —respondió ella—, no pude dejar de
respondelle.
— Ahora bien —dijo el cura—, traedme, señor huésped, aquesos libros, que los
quiero ver.
— Que me place —respondió él.
Y, entrando en su aposento, sacó dél una maletilla vieja, cerrada con una
cadenilla, y, abriéndola, halló en ella tres libros grandes y unos papeles
de muy buena letra, escritos de mano. El primer libro que abrió vio que era
Don Cirongilio de Tracia; y el otro, de Felixmarte de Hircania; y el otro,
la Historia del Gran Capitán Gonzalo Hernández de Córdoba, con la vida de
Diego García de Paredes. Así como el cura leyó los dos títulos primeros,
volvió el rostro al barbero y dijo:
— Falta nos hacen aquí ahora el ama de mi amigo y su sobrina.
— No hacen —respondió el barbero—, que también sé yo llevallos al corral o a
la chimenea; que en verdad que hay muy buen fuego en ella.
— Luego, ¿quiere vuestra merced quemar más libros? —dijo el ventero.
— No más —dijo el cura— que estos dos: el de Don Cirongilio y el de
Felixmarte.
— Pues, ¿por ventura —dijo el ventero— mis libros son herejes o flemáticos,
que los quiere quemar?
— Cismáticos queréis decir, amigo —dijo el barbero—, que no flemáticos.
— Así es —replicó el ventero—; mas si alguno quiere quemar, sea ese del Gran
Capitán y dese Diego García, que antes dejaré quemar un hijo que dejar
quemar ninguno desotros.
— Hermano mío —dijo el cura—, estos dos libros son mentirosos y están llenos
de disparates y devaneos; y este del Gran Capitán es historia verdadera, y
tiene los hechos de Gonzalo Hernández de Córdoba, el cual, por sus muchas y
grandes hazañas, mereció ser llamado de todo el mundo Gran Capitán,
renombre famoso y claro, y dél sólo merecido. Y este Diego García de
Paredes fue un principal caballero, natural de la ciudad de Trujillo, en
Estremadura, valentísimo soldado, y de tantas fuerzas naturales que detenía
con un dedo una rueda de molino en la mitad de su furia; y, puesto con un
montante en la entrada de una puente, detuvo a todo un innumerable
ejército, que no pasase por ella; y hizo otras tales cosas que, como si él
las cuenta y las escribe él asimismo, con la modestia de caballero y de
coronista propio, las escribiera otro, libre y desapasionado, pusieran en
su olvido las de los Hétores, Aquiles y Roldanes.
— ¡Tomaos con mi padre! —dijo el dicho ventero—. ¡Mirad de qué se espanta:
de detener una rueda de molino! Por Dios, ahora había vuestra merced de
leer lo que hizo Felixmarte de Hircania, que de un revés solo partió cinco
gigantes por la cintura, como si fueran hechos de habas, como los
frailecicos que hacen los niños. Y otra vez arremetió con un grandísimo y
poderosísimo ejército, donde llevó más de un millón y seiscientos mil
soldados, todos armados desde el pie hasta la cabeza, y los desbarató a
todos, como si fueran manadas de ovejas. Pues, ¿qué me dirán del bueno de
don Cirongilio de Tracia, que fue tan valiente y animoso como se verá en el
libro, donde cuenta que, navegando por un río, le salió de la mitad del
agua una serpiente de fuego, y él, así como la vio, se arrojó sobre ella, y
se puso a horcajadas encima de sus escamosas espaldas, y le apretó con
ambas manos la garganta, con tanta fuerza que, viendo la serpiente que la
iba ahogando, no tuvo otro remedio sino dejarse ir a lo hondo del río,
llevándose tras sí al caballero, que nunca la quiso soltar? Y, cuando
llegaron allá bajo, se halló en unos palacios y en unos jardines tan lindos
que era maravilla; y luego la sierpe se volvió en un viejo anciano, que le
dijo tantas de cosas que no hay más que oír. Calle, señor, que si oyese
esto, se volvería loco de placer. ¡Dos higas para el Gran Capitán y para
ese Diego García que dice!
Oyendo esto Dorotea, dijo callando a Cardenio:
— Poco le falta a nuestro huésped para hacer la segunda parte de don
Quijote.
— Así me parece a mí —respondió Cardenio—, porque, según da indicio, él
tiene por cierto que todo lo que estos libros cuentan pasó ni más ni menos
que lo escriben, y no le harán creer otra cosa frailes descalzos.
— Mirad, hermano —tornó a decir el cura—, que no hubo en el mundo Felixmarte
de Hircania, ni don Cirongilio de Tracia, ni otros caballeros semejantes
que los libros de caballerías cuentan, porque todo es compostura y ficción
de ingenios ociosos, que los compusieron para el efeto que vos decís de
entretener el tiempo, como lo entretienen leyéndolos vuestros segadores;
porque realmente os juro que nunca tales caballeros fueron en el mundo, ni
tales hazañas ni disparates acontecieron en él.
— ¡A otro perro con ese hueso! —respondió el ventero—. ¡Como si yo no
supiese cuántas son cinco y adónde me aprieta el zapato! No piense vuestra
merced darme papilla, porque por Dios que no soy nada blanco. ¡Bueno es que
quiera darme vuestra merced a entender que todo aquello que estos buenos
libros dicen sea disparates y mentiras, estando impreso con licencia de los
señores del Consejo Real, como si ellos fueran gente que habían de dejar
imprimir tanta mentira junta, y tantas batallas y tantos encantamentos que
quitan el juicio!
— Ya os he dicho, amigo —replicó el cura—, que esto se hace para entretener
nuestros ociosos pensamientos; y, así como se consiente en las repúblicas
bien concertadas que haya juegos de ajedrez, de pelota y de trucos, para
entretener a algunos que ni tienen, ni deben, ni pueden trabajar, así se
consiente imprimir y que haya tales libros, creyendo, como es verdad, que
no ha de haber alguno tan ignorante que tenga por historia verdadera
ninguna destos libros. Y si me fuera lícito agora, y el auditorio lo
requiriera, yo dijera cosas acerca de lo que han de tener los libros de
caballerías para ser buenos, que quizá fueran de provecho y aun de gusto
para algunos; pero yo espero que vendrá tiempo en que lo pueda comunicar
con quien pueda remediallo, y en este entretanto creed, señor ventero, lo
que os he dicho, y tomad vuestros libros, y allá os avenid con sus verdades
o mentiras, y buen provecho os hagan, y quiera Dios que no cojeéis del pie
que cojea vuestro huésped don Quijote.
— Eso no —respondió el ventero—, que no seré yo tan loco que me haga
caballero andante: que bien veo que ahora no se usa lo que se usaba en
aquel tiempo, cuando se dice que andaban por el mundo estos famosos
caballeros.
A la mitad desta plática se halló Sancho presente, y quedó muy confuso y
pensativo de lo que había oído decir que ahora no se usaban caballeros
andantes, y que todos los libros de caballerías eran necedades y mentiras,
y propuso en su corazón de esperar en lo que paraba aquel viaje de su amo,
y que si no salía con la felicidad que él pensaba, determinaba de dejalle y
volverse con su mujer y sus hijos a su acostumbrado trabajo.
Llevábase la maleta y los libros el ventero, mas el cura le dijo:
— Esperad, que quiero ver qué papeles son esos que de tan buena letra están
escritos.
Sacólos el huésped, y, dándoselos a leer, vio hasta obra de ocho pliegos
escritos de mano, y al principio tenían un título grande que decía: Novela
del curioso impertinente. Leyó el cura para sí tres o cuatro renglones y
dijo:
— Cierto que no me parece mal el título desta novela, y que me viene
voluntad de leella toda.
A lo que respondió el ventero:
— Pues bien puede leella su reverencia, porque le hago saber que algunos
huéspedes que aquí la han leído les ha contentado mucho, y me la han pedido
con muchas veras; mas yo no se la he querido dar, pensando volvérsela a
quien aquí dejó esta maleta olvidada con estos libros y esos papeles; que
bien puede ser que vuelva su dueño por aquí algún tiempo, y, aunque sé que
me han de hacer falta los libros, a fe que se los he de volver: que, aunque
ventero, todavía soy cristiano.
— Vos tenéis mucha razón, amigo —dijo el cura—, mas, con todo eso, si la
novela me contenta, me la habéis de dejar trasladar.
— De muy buena gana —respondió el ventero.
Mientras los dos esto decían, había tomado Cardenio la novela y comenzado a
leer en ella; y, pareciéndole lo mismo que al cura, le rogó que la leyese
de modo que todos la oyesen.
— Sí leyera —dijo el cura—, si no fuera mejor gastar este tiempo en dormir
que en leer.
— Harto reposo será para mí —dijo Dorotea— entretener el tiempo oyendo algún
cuento, pues aún no tengo el espíritu tan sosegado que me conceda dormir
cuando fuera razón.
— Pues desa manera —dijo el cura—, quiero leerla, por curiosidad siquiera;
quizá tendrá alguna de gusto.
Acudió maese Nicolás a rogarle lo mesmo, y Sancho también; lo cual visto
del cura, y entendiendo que a todos daría gusto y él le recibiría, dijo:
— Pues así es, esténme todos atentos, que la novela comienza desta manera:
Capítulo XXXIII. Donde se cuenta la novela del Curioso impertinente
«En Florencia, ciudad rica y famosa de Italia, en la provincia que llaman
Toscana, vivían Anselmo y Lotario, dos caballeros ricos y principales, y
tan amigos que, por excelencia y antonomasia, de todos los que los conocían
los dos amigos eran llamados. Eran solteros, mozos de una misma edad y de
unas mismas costumbres; todo lo cual era bastante causa a que los dos con
recíproca amistad se correspondiesen. Bien es verdad que el Anselmo era
algo más inclinado a los pasatiempos amorosos que el Lotario, al cual
llevaban tras sí los de la caza; pero, cuando se ofrecía, dejaba Anselmo de
acudir a sus gustos por seguir los de Lotario, y Lotario dejaba los suyos
por acudir a los de Anselmo; y, desta manera, andaban tan a una sus
voluntades, que no había concertado reloj que así lo anduviese.
»Andaba Anselmo perdido de amores de una doncella principal y hermosa de la
misma ciudad, hija de tan buenos padres y tan buena ella por sí, que se
determinó, con el parecer de su amigo Lotario, sin el cual ninguna cosa
hacía, de pedilla por esposa a sus padres, y así lo puso en ejecución; y el
que llevó la embajada fue Lotario, y el que concluyó el negocio tan a gusto
de su amigo, que en breve tiempo se vio puesto en la posesión que deseaba,
y Camila tan contenta de haber alcanzado a Anselmo por esposo, que no
cesaba de dar gracias al cielo, y a Lotario, por cuyo medio tanto bien le
había venido.
»Los primeros días, como todos los de boda suelen ser alegres, continuó
Lotario, como solía, la casa de su amigo Anselmo, procurando honralle,
festejalle y regocijalle con todo aquello que a él le fue posible; pero,
acabadas las bodas y sosegada ya la frecuencia de las visitas y parabienes,
comenzó Lotario a descuidarse con cuidado de las idas en casa de Anselmo,
por parecerle a él —como es razón que parezca a todos los que fueren
discretos— que no se han de visitar ni continuar las casas de los amigos
casados de la misma manera que cuando eran solteros; porque, aunque la
buena y verdadera amistad no puede ni debe de ser sospechosa en nada, con
todo esto, es tan delicada la honra del casado, que parece que se puede
ofender aun de los mesmos hermanos, cuanto más de los amigos.
»Notó Anselmo la remisión de Lotario, y formó dél quejas grandes,
diciéndole que si él supiera que el casarse había de ser parte para no
comunicalle como solía, que jamás lo hubiera hecho, y que si, por la buena
correspondencia que los dos tenían mientras él fue soltero, habían
alcanzado tan dulce nombre como el de ser llamados los dos amigos, que no
permitiese, por querer hacer del circunspecto, sin otra ocasión alguna,
que tan famoso y tan agradable nombre se perdiese; y que así, le suplicaba,
si era lícito que tal término de hablar se usase entre ellos, que volviese
a ser señor de su casa, y a entrar y salir en ella como de antes,
asegurándole que su esposa Camila no tenía otro gusto ni otra voluntad que
la que él quería que tuviese, y que, por haber sabido ella con cuántas
veras los dos se amaban, estaba confusa de ver en él tanta esquiveza.
»A todas estas y otras muchas razones que Anselmo dijo a Lotario para
persuadille volviese como solía a su casa, respondió Lotario con tanta
prudencia, discreción y aviso, que Anselmo quedó satisfecho de la buena
intención de su amigo, y quedaron de concierto que dos días en la semana y
las fiestas fuese Lotario a comer con él; y, aunque esto quedó así
concertado entre los dos, propuso Lotario de no hacer más de aquello que
viese que más convenía a la honra de su amigo, cuyo crédito estimaba en
más que el suyo proprio. Decía él, y decía bien, que el casado a quien el
cielo había concedido mujer hermosa, tanto cuidado había de tener qué
amigos llevaba a su casa como en mirar con qué amigas su mujer conversaba,
porque lo que no se hace ni concierta en las plazas, ni en los templos, ni
en las fiestas públicas, ni estaciones —cosas que no todas veces las han de
negar los maridos a sus mujeres—, se concierta y facilita en casa de la
amiga o la parienta de quien más satisfación se tiene.
»También decía Lotario que tenían necesidad los casados de tener cada uno
algún amigo que le advirtiese de los descuidos que en su proceder hiciese,
porque suele acontecer que con el mucho amor que el marido a la mujer
tiene, o no le advierte o no le dice, por no enojalla, que haga o deje de
hacer algunas cosas, que el hacellas o no, le sería de honra o de
vituperio; de lo cual, siendo del amigo advertido, fácilmente pondría
remedio en todo. Pero, ¿dónde se hallará amigo tan discreto y tan leal y
verdadero como aquí Lotario le pide? No lo sé yo, por cierto; sólo Lotario
era éste, que con toda solicitud y advertimiento miraba por la honra de su
amigo y procuraba dezmar, frisar y acortar los días del concierto del ir a
su casa, porque no pareciese mal al vulgo ocioso y a los ojos vagabundos y
maliciosos la entrada de un mozo rico, gentilhombre y bien nacido, y de las
buenas partes que él pensaba que tenía, en la casa de una mujer tan hermosa
como Camila; que, puesto que su bondad y valor podía poner freno a toda
maldiciente lengua, todavía no quería poner en duda su crédito ni el de su
amigo, y por esto los más de los días del concierto los ocupaba y
entretenía en otras cosas, que él daba a entender ser inexcusables. Así
que, en quejas del uno y disculpas del otro se pasaban muchos ratos y
partes del día.
»Sucedió, pues, que uno que los dos se andaban paseando por un prado fuera
de la ciudad, Anselmo dijo a Lotario las semejantes razones:
»—Pensabas, amigo Lotario, que a las mercedes que Dios me ha hecho en
hacerme hijo de tales padres como fueron los míos y al darme, no con mano
escasa, los bienes, así los que llaman de naturaleza como los de fortuna,
no puedo yo corresponder con agradecimiento que llegue al bien recebido, y
sobre al que me hizo en darme a ti por amigo y a Camila por mujer propria:
dos prendas que las estimo, si no en el grado que debo, en el que puedo.
Pues con todas estas partes, que suelen ser el todo con que los hombres
suelen y pueden vivir contentos, vivo yo el más despechado y el más
desabrido hombre de todo el universo mundo; porque no sé qué días a esta
parte me fatiga y aprieta un deseo tan estraño, y tan fuera del uso común
de otros, que yo me maravillo de mí mismo, y me culpo y me riño a solas, y
procuro callarlo y encubrirlo de mis proprios pensamientos; y así me ha
sido posible salir con este secreto como si de industria procurara decillo
a todo el mundo. Y, pues que, en efeto, él ha de salir a plaza,quiero que
sea en la del archivo de tu secreto, confiado que, con él y con la
diligencia que pondrás, como mi amigo verdadero, en remediarme, yo me veré
presto libre de la angustia que me causa, y llegará mi alegría por tu
solicitud al grado que ha llegado mi descontento por mi locura.
»Suspenso tenían a Lotario las razones de Anselmo, y no sabía en qué había
de parar tan larga prevención o preámbulo; y, aunque iba revolviendo en su
imaginación qué deseo podría ser aquel que a su amigo tanto fatigaba, dio
siempre muy lejos del blanco de la verdad; y, por salir presto de la agonía
que le causaba aquella suspensión, le dijo que hacía notorio agravio a su
mucha amistad en andar buscando rodeos para decirle sus más encubiertos
pensamientos, pues tenía cierto que se podía prometer dél, o ya consejos
para entretenellos, o ya remedio para cumplillos.
»—Así es la verdad —respondió Anselmo—, y con esa confianza te hago saber,
amigo Lotario, que el deseo que me fatiga es pensar si Camila, mi esposa,
es tan buena y tan perfeta como yo pienso; y no puedo enterarme en esta
verdad, si no es probándola de manera que la prueba manifieste los quilates
de su bondad, como el fuego muestra los del oro. Porque yo tengo para mí,
¡oh amigo!, que no es una mujer más buena de cuanto es o no es solicitada,
y que aquella sola es fuerte que no se dobla a las promesas, a las dádivas,
a las lágrimas y a las continuas importunidades de los solícitos amantes.
Porque, ¿qué hay que agradecer —decía él— que una mujer sea buena, si nadie
le dice que sea mala? ¿Qué mucho que esté recogida y temerosa la que no le
dan ocasión para que se suelte, y la que sabe que tiene marido que, en
cogiéndola en la primera desenvoltura, la ha de quitar la vida? Ansí que,
la que es buena por temor, o por falta de lugar, yo no la quiero tener en
aquella estima en que tendré a la solicitada y perseguida que salió con la
corona del vencimiento. De modo que, por estas razones y por otras muchas
que te pudiera decir para acreditar y fortalecer la opinión que tengo,
deseo que Camila, mi esposa, pase por estas dificultades y se acrisole y
quilate en el fuego de verse requerida y solicitada, y de quien tenga valor
para poner en ella sus deseos; y si ella sale, como creo que saldrá, con la
palma desta batalla, tendré yo por sin igual mi ventura; podré yo decir que
está colmo el vacío de mis deseos; diré que me cupo en suerte la mujer
fuerte, de quien el Sabio dice que ¿quién la hallará? Y, cuando esto suceda
al revés de lo que pienso, con el gusto de ver que acerté en mi opinión,
llevaré sin pena la que de razón podrá causarme mi tan costosa experiencia.
Y, prosupuesto que ninguna cosa de cuantas me dijeres en contra de mi deseo
ha de ser de algún provecho para dejar de ponerle por la obra, quiero, ¡oh
amigo Lotario!, que te dispongas a ser el instrumento que labre aquesta
obra de mi gusto; que yo te daré lugar para que lo hagas, sin faltarte todo
aquello que yo viere ser necesario para solicitar a una mujer honesta,
honrada, recogida y desinteresada. Y muéveme, entre otras cosas, a fiar de
ti esta tan ardua empresa, el ver que si de ti es vencida Camila, no ha de
llegar el vencimiento a todo trance y rigor, sino a sólo a tener por hecho
lo que se ha de hacer, por buen respeto; y así, no quedaré yo ofendido más
de con el deseo, y mi injuria quedará escondida en la virtud de tu
silencio, que bien sé que en lo que me tocare ha de ser eterno como el de
la muerte. Así que, si quieres que yo tenga vida que pueda decir que lo es,
desde luego has de entrar en esta amorosa batalla, no tibia ni
perezosamente, sino con el ahínco y diligencia que mi deseo pide, y con la
confianza que nuestra amistad me asegura.
»Éstas fueron las razones que Anselmo dijo a Lotario, a todas las cuales
estuvo tan atento, que si no fueron las que quedan escritas que le dijo, no
desplegó sus labios hasta que hubo acabado; y, viendo que no decía más,
después que le estuvo mirando un buen espacio, como si mirara otra cosa que
jamás hubiera visto, que le causara admiración y espanto, le dijo:
»—No me puedo persuadir, ¡oh amigo Anselmo!, a que no sean burlas las cosas
que me has dicho; que, a pensar que de veras las decías, no consintiera que
tan adelante pasaras, porque con no escucharte previniera tu larga arenga.
Sin duda imagino, o que no me conoces, o que yo no te conozco. Pero no; que
bien sé que eres Anselmo, y tú sabes que yo soy Lotario; el daño está en
que yo pienso que no eres el Anselmo que solías, y tú debes de haber
pensado que tampoco yo soy el Lotario que debía ser, porque las cosas que
me has dicho, ni son de aquel Anselmo mi amigo, ni las que me pides se han
de pedir a aquel Lotario que tú conoces; porque los buenos amigos han de
probar a sus amigos y valerse dellos, como dijo un poeta, usque ad aras;
que quiso decir que no se habían de valer de su amistad en cosas que fuesen
contra Dios. Pues, si esto sintió un gentil de la amistad, ¿cuánto mejor es
que lo sienta el cristiano, que sabe que por ninguna humana ha de perder la
amistad divina? Y cuando el amigo tirase tanto la barra que pusiese aparte
los respetos del cielo por acudir a los de su amigo, no ha de ser por cosas
ligeras y de poco momento, sino por aquellas en que vaya la honra y la vida
de su amigo. Pues dime tú ahora, Anselmo: ¿cuál destas dos cosas tienes en
peligro para que yo me aventure a complacerte y a hacer una cosa tan
detestable como me pides? Ninguna, por cierto; antes, me pides, según yo
entiendo, que procure y solicite quitarte la honra y la vida, y quitármela
a mí juntamente. Porque si yo he de procurar quitarte la honra, claro está
que te quito la vida, pues el hombre sin honra peor es que un muerto; y,
siendo yo el instrumento, como tú quieres que lo sea, de tanto mal tuyo,
¿no vengo a quedar deshonrado, y, por el mesmo consiguiente, sin vida?
Escucha, amigo Anselmo, y ten paciencia de no responderme hasta que acabe
de decirte lo que se me ofreciere acerca de lo que te ha pedido tu deseo;
que tiempo quedará para que tú me repliques y yo te escuche.
»—Que me place —dijo Anselmo—: di lo que quisieres.
»Y Lotario prosiguió diciendo:
»—Paréceme, ¡oh Anselmo!, que tienes tú ahora el ingenio como el que
siempre tienen los moros, a los cuales no se les puede dar a entender el
error de su secta con las acotaciones de la Santa Escritura, ni con razones
que consistan en especulación del entendimiento, ni que vayan fundadas en
artículos de fe, sino que les han de traer ejemplos palpables, fáciles,
intelegibles, demonstrativos, indubitables, con demostraciones matemáticas
que no se pueden negar, como cuando dicen: "Si de dos partes iguales
quitamos partes iguales, las que quedan también son iguales"; y, cuando
esto no entiendan de palabra, como, en efeto, no lo entienden, háseles de
mostrar con las manos y ponérselo delante de los ojos, y, aun con todo
esto, no basta nadie con ellos a persuadirles las verdades de mi sacra
religión. Y este mesmo término y modo me convendrá usar contigo, porque el
deseo que en ti ha nacido va tan descaminado y tan fuera de todo aquello
que tenga sombra de razonable, que me parece que ha de ser tiempo gastado
el que ocupare en darte a entender tu simplicidad, que por ahora no le
quiero dar otro nombre, y aun estoy por dejarte en tu desatino, en pena de
tu mal deseo; mas no me deja usar deste rigor la amistad que te tengo, la
cual no consiente que te deje puesto en tan manifiesto peligro de perderte.
Y, porque claro lo veas, dime, Anselmo: ¿tú no me has dicho que tengo de
solicitar a una retirada, persuadir a una honesta, ofrecer a una
desinteresada, servir a una prudente? Sí que me lo has dicho. Pues si tú
sabes que tienes mujer retirada, honesta, desinteresada y prudente, ¿qué
buscas? Y si piensas que de todos mis asaltos ha de salir vencedora, como
saldrá sin duda, ¿qué mejores títulos piensas darle después que los que
ahora tiene, o qué será más después de lo que es ahora? O es que tú no la
tienes por la que dices, o tú no sabes lo que pides. Si no la tienes por lo
que dices, ¿para qué quieres probarla, sino, como a mala, hacer della lo
que más te viniere en gusto? Mas si es tan buena como crees, impertinente
cosa será hacer experiencia de la mesma verdad, pues, después de hecha, se
ha de quedar con la estimación que primero tenía. Así que, es razón
concluyente que el intentar las cosas de las cuales antes nos puede suceder
daño que provecho es de juicios sin discurso y temerarios, y más cuando
quieren intentar aquellas a que no son forzados ni compelidos, y que de muy
lejos traen descubierto que el intentarlas es manifiesta locura. Las cosas
dificultosas se intentan por Dios, o por el mundo, o por entrambos a dos:
las que se acometen por Dios son las que acometieron los santos,
acometiendo a vivir vida de ángeles en cuerpos humanos; las que se acometen
por respeto del mundo son las de aquellos que pasan tanta infinidad de
agua, tanta diversidad de climas, tanta estrañeza de gentes, por adquirir
estos que llaman bienes de fortuna. Y las que se intentan por Dios y por el
mundo juntamente son aquellas de los valerosos soldados, que apenas veen en
el contrario muro abierto tanto espacio cuanto es el que pudo hacer una
redonda bala de artillería, cuando, puesto aparte todo temor, sin hacer
discurso ni advertir al manifiesto peligro que les amenaza, llevados en
vuelo de las alas del deseo de volver por su fe, por su nación y por su
rey, se arrojan intrépidamente por la mitad de mil contrapuestas muertes
que los esperan. Estas cosas son las que suelen intentarse, y es honra,
gloria y provecho intentarlas, aunque tan llenas de inconvenientes y
peligros. Pero la que tú dices que quieres intentar y poner por obra, ni te
ha de alcanzar gloria de Dios, bienes de la fortuna, ni fama con los
hombres; porque, puesto que salgas con ella como deseas, no has de quedar
ni más ufano, ni más rico, ni más honrado que estás ahora; y si no sales,
te has de ver en la mayor miseria que imaginarse pueda, porque no te ha de
aprovechar pensar entonces que no sabe nadie la desgracia que te ha
sucedido, porque bastará para afligirte y deshacerte que la sepas tú mesmo.
Y, para confirmación desta verdad, te quiero decir una estancia que hizo el
famoso poeta Luis Tansilo, en el fin de su primera parte de Las lágrimas de
San Pedro, que dice así:
Crece el dolor y crece la vergüenza
en Pedro, cuando el día se ha mostrado;
y, aunque allí no ve a nadie, se avergüenza
de sí mesmo, por ver que había pecado:
que a un magnánimo pecho a haber vergüenza
no sólo ha de moverle el ser mirado;
que de sí se avergüenza cuando yerra,
si bien otro no vee que cielo y tierra.
Así que, no escusarás con el secreto tu dolor; antes, tendrás que llorar
contino, si no lágrimas de los ojos, lágrimas de sangre del corazón, como
las lloraba aquel simple doctor que nuestro poeta nos cuenta que hizo la
prueba del vaso, que, con mejor discurso, se escusó de hacerla el prudente
Reinaldos; que, puesto que aquello sea ficción poética, tiene en sí
encerrados secretos morales dignos de ser advertidos y entendidos e
imitados. Cuanto más que, con lo que ahora pienso decirte, acabarás de
venir en conocimiento del grande error que quieres cometer. Dime, Anselmo,
si el cielo, o la suerte buena, te hubiera hecho señor y legítimo posesor
de un finísimo diamante, de cuya bondad y quilates estuviesen satisfechos
cuantos lapidarios le viesen, y que todos a una voz y de común parecer
dijesen que llegaba en quilates, bondad y fineza a cuanto se podía estender
la naturaleza de tal piedra, y tú mesmo lo creyeses así, sin saber otra
cosa en contrario, ¿sería justo que te viniese en deseo de tomar aquel
diamante, y ponerle entre un ayunque y un martillo, y allí, a pura fuerza
de golpes y brazos, probar si es tan duro y tan fino como dicen? Y más, si
lo pusieses por obra; que, puesto caso que la piedra hiciese resistencia a
tan necia prueba, no por eso se le añadiría más valor ni más fama; y si se
rompiese, cosa que podría ser, ¿no se perdería todo? Sí, por cierto,
dejando a su dueño en estimación de que todos le tengan por simple. Pues
haz cuenta, Anselmo amigo, que Camila es fínisimo diamante, así en tu
estimación como en la ajena, y que no es razón ponerla en contingencia de
que se quiebre, pues, aunque se quede con su entereza, no puede subir a más
valor del que ahora tiene; y si faltase y no resistiese, considera desde
ahora cuál quedarías sin ella, y con cuánta razón te podrías quejar de ti
mesmo, por haber sido causa de su perdición y la tuya. Mira que no hay joya
en el mundo que tanto valga como la mujer casta y honrada, y que todo el
honor de las mujeres consiste en la opinión buena que dellas se tiene; y,
pues la de tu esposa es tal que llega al estremo de bondad que sabes, ¿para
qué quieres poner esta verdad en duda? Mira, amigo, que la mujer es animal
imperfecto, y que no se le han de poner embarazos donde tropiece y caiga,
sino quitárselos y despejalle el camino de cualquier inconveniente, para
que sin pesadumbre corra ligera a alcanzar la perfeción que le falta, que
consiste en el ser virtuosa. Cuentan los naturales que el arminio es un
animalejo que tiene una piel blanquísima, y que cuando quieren cazarle, los
cazadores usan deste artificio: que, sabiendo las partes por donde suele
pasar y acudir, las atajan con lodo, y después, ojeándole, le encaminan
hacia aquel lugar, y así como el arminio llega al lodo, se está quedo y se
deja prender y cautivar, a trueco de no pasar por el cieno y perder y
ensuciar su blancura, que la estima en más que la libertad y la vida. La
honesta y casta mujer es arminio, y es más que nieve blanca y limpia la
virtud de la honestidad; y el que quisiere que no la pierda, antes la
guarde y conserve, ha de usar de otro estilo diferente que con el arminio
se tiene, porque no le han de poner delante el cieno de los regalos y
servicios de los importunos amantes, porque quizá, y aun sin quizá, no
tiene tanta virtud y fuerza natural que pueda por sí mesma atropellar y
pasar por aquellos embarazos, y es necesario quitárselos y ponerle delante
la limpieza de la virtud y la belleza que encierra en sí la buena fama. Es
asimesmo la buena mujer como espejo de cristal luciente y claro; pero está
sujeto a empañarse y escurecerse con cualquiera aliento que le toque. Hase
de usar con la honesta mujer el estilo que con las reliquias: adorarlas y
no tocarlas. Hase de guardar y estimar la mujer buena como se guarda y
estima un hermoso jardín que está lleno de flores y rosas, cuyo dueño no
consiente que nadie le pasee ni manosee; basta que desde lejos, y por entre
las verjas de hierro, gocen de su fragrancia y hermosura. Finalmente,
quiero decirte unos versos que se me han venido a la memoria, que los oí en
una comedia moderna, que me parece que hacen al propósito de lo que vamos
tratando. Aconsejaba un prudente viejo a otro, padre de una doncella, que
la recogiese, guardase y encerrase, y entre otras razones, le dijo éstas:
Es de vidrio la mujer;
pero no se ha de probar
si se puede o no quebrar,
porque todo podría ser.
Y es más fácil el quebrarse,
y no es cordura ponerse
a peligro de romperse
lo que no puede soldarse.
Y en esta opinión estén
todos, y en razón la fundo:
que si hay Dánaes en el mundo,
hay pluvias de oro también.
Cuanto hasta aquí te he dicho, ¡oh Anselmo!, ha sido por lo que a ti te
toca; y ahora es bien que se oiga algo de lo que a mí me conviene; y si
fuere largo, perdóname, que todo lo requiere el laberinto donde te has
entrado y de donde quieres que yo te saque. Tú me tienes por amigo y
quieres quitarme la honra, cosa que es contra toda amistad; y aun no sólo
pretendes esto, sino que procuras que yo te la quite a ti. Que me la
quieres quitar a mí está claro, pues, cuando Camila vea que yo la solicito,
como me pides, cierto está que me ha de tener por hombre sin honra y mal
mirado, pues intento y hago una cosa tan fuera de aquello que el ser quien
soy y tu amistad me obliga. De que quieres que te la quite a ti no hay
duda, porque, viendo Camila que yo la solicito, ha de pensar que yo he
visto en ella alguna liviandad que me dio atrevimiento a descubrirle mi mal
deseo; y, teniéndose por deshonrada, te toca a ti, como a cosa suya, su
mesma deshonra. Y de aquí nace lo que comúnmente se platica: que el marido
de la mujer adúltera, puesto que él no lo sepa ni haya dado ocasión para
que su mujer no sea la que debe, ni haya sido en su mano, ni en su descuido
y poco recato estorbar su desgracia, con todo, le llaman y le nombran con
nombre de vituperio y bajo; y en cierta manera le miran, los que la maldad
de su mujer saben, con ojos de menosprecio, en cambio de mirarle con los de
lástima, viendo que no por su culpa, sino por el gusto de su mala
compañera, está en aquella desventura. Pero quiérote decir la causa por que
con justa razón es deshonrado el marido de la mujer mala, aunque él no sepa
que lo es, ni tenga culpa, ni haya sido parte, ni dado ocasión, para que
ella lo sea. Y no te canses de oírme, que todo ha de redundar en tu
provecho. Cuando Dios crió a nuestro primero padre en el Paraíso terrenal,
dice la Divina Escritura que infundió Dios sueño en Adán, y que, estando
durmiendo, le sacó una costilla del lado siniestro, de la cual formó a
nuestra madre Eva; y, así como Adán despertó y la miró, dijo: ''Ésta es
carne de mi carne y hueso de mis huesos''. Y Dios dijo: ''Por ésta dejará
el hombre a su padre y madre, y serán dos en una carne misma''. Y entonces
fue instituido el divino sacramento del matrimonio, con tales lazos que
sola la muerte puede desatarlos. Y tiene tanta fuerza y virtud este
milagroso sacramento, que hace que dos diferentes personas sean una mesma
carne; y aún hace más en los buenos casados, que, aunque tienen dos almas,
no tienen más de una voluntad. Y de aquí viene que, como la carne de la
esposa sea una mesma con la del esposo, las manchas que en ella caen, o los
defectos que se procura, redundan en la carne del marido, aunque él no haya
dado, como queda dicho, ocasión para aquel daño. Porque, así como el dolor
del pie o de cualquier miembro del cuerpo humano le siente todo el cuerpo,
por ser todo de una carne mesma, y la cabeza siente el daño del tobillo,
sin que ella se le haya causado, así el marido es participante de la
deshonra de la mujer, por ser una mesma cosa con ella. Y como las honras y
deshonras del mundo sean todas y nazcan de carne y sangre, y las de la
mujer mala sean deste género, es forzoso que al marido le quepa parte
dellas, y sea tenido por deshonrado sin que él lo sepa. Mira, pues, ¡oh
Anselmo!, al peligro que te pones en querer turbar el sosiego en que tu
buena esposa vive. Mira por cuán vana e impertinente curiosidad quieres
revolver los humores que ahora están sosegados en el pecho de tu casta
esposa. Advierte que lo que aventuras a ganar es poco, y que lo que
perderás será tanto que lo dejaré en su punto, porque me faltan palabras
para encarecerlo. Pero si todo cuanto he dicho no basta a moverte de tu mal
propósito, bien puedes buscar otro instrumento de tu deshonra y desventura,
que yo no pienso serlo, aunque por ello pierda tu amistad, que es la mayor
pérdida que imaginar puedo.
»Calló, en diciendo esto, el virtuoso y prudente Lotario, y Anselmo quedó
tan confuso y pensativo que por un buen espacio no le pudo responder
palabra; pero, en fin, le dijo:
»—Con la atención que has visto he escuchado, Lotario amigo, cuanto has
querido decirme, y en tus razones, ejemplos y comparaciones he visto la
mucha discreción que tienes y el estremo de la verdadera amistad que
alcanzas; y ansimesmo veo y confieso que si no sigo tu parecer y me voy
tras el mío, voy huyendo del bien y corriendo tras el mal. Prosupuesto
esto, has de considerar que yo padezco ahora la enfermedad que suelen tener
algunas mujeres, que se les antoja comer tierra, yeso, carbón y otras cosas
peores, aun asquerosas para mirarse, cuanto más para comerse; así que, es
menester usar de algún artificio para que yo sane, y esto se podía hacer
con facilidad, sólo con que comiences, aunque tibia y fingidamente, a
solicitar a Camila, la cual no ha de ser tan tierna que a los primeros
encuentros dé con su honestidad por tierra; y con solo este principio
quedaré contento y tú habrás cumplido con lo que debes a nuestra amistad,
no solamente dándome la vida, sino persuadiéndome de no verme sin honra. Y
estás obligado a hacer esto por una razón sola; y es que, estando yo, como
estoy, determinado de poner en plática esta prueba, no has tú de consentir
que yo dé cuenta de mi desatino a otra persona, con que pondría en aventura
el honor que tú procuras que no pierda; y, cuando el tuyo no esté en el
punto que debe en la intención de Camila en tanto que la solicitares,
importa poco o nada, pues con brevedad, viendo en ella la entereza que
esperamos, le podrás decir la pura verdad de nuestro artificio, con que
volverá tu crédito al ser primero. Y, pues tan poco aventuras y tanto
contento me puedes dar aventurándote, no lo dejes de hacer, aunque más
inconvenientes se te pongan delante, pues, como ya he dicho, con sólo que
comiences daré por concluida la causa.
»Viendo Lotario la resoluta voluntad de Anselmo, y no sabiendo qué más
ejemplos traerle ni qué más razones mostrarle para que no la siguiese, y
viendo que le amenazaba que daría a otro cuenta de su mal deseo, por evitar
mayor mal, determinó de contentarle y hacer lo que le pedía, con propósito
e intención de guiar aquel negocio de modo que, sin alterar los
pensamientos de Camila, quedase Anselmo satisfecho; y así, le respondió que
no comunicase su pensamiento con otro alguno, que él tomaba a su cargo
aquella empresa, la cual comenzaría cuando a él le diese más gusto.
Abrazóle Anselmo tierna y amorosamente, y agradecióle su ofrecimiento, como
si alguna grande merced le hubiera hecho; y quedaron de acuerdo entre los
dos que desde otro día siguiente se comenzase la obra; que él le daría
lugar y tiempo como a sus solas pudiese hablar a Camila, y asimesmo le
daría dineros y joyas que darla y que ofrecerla. Aconsejóle que le diese
músicas, que escribiese versos en su alabanza, y que, cuando él no quisiese
tomar trabajo de hacerlos, él mesmo los haría. A todo se ofreció Lotario,
bien con diferente intención que Anselmo pensaba.
»Y con este acuerdo se volvieron a casa de Anselmo, donde hallaron a Camila
con ansia y cuidado, esperando a su esposo, porque aquel día tardaba en
venir más de lo acostumbrado.
»Fuese Lotario a su casa, y Anselmo quedó en la suya, tan contento como
Lotario fue pensativo, no sabiendo qué traza dar para salir bien de aquel
impertinente negocio. Pero aquella noche pensó el modo que tendría para
engañar a Anselmo, sin ofender a Camila; y otro día vino a comer con su
amigo, y fue bien recebido de Camila, la cual le recebía y regalaba con
mucha voluntad, por entender la buena que su esposo le tenía.
»Acabaron de comer, levantaron los manteles y Anselmo dijo a Lotario que se
quedase allí con Camila, en tanto que él iba a un negocio forzoso, que
dentro de hora y media volvería. Rogóle Camila que no se fuese y Lotario se
ofreció a hacerle compañía, más nada aprovechó con Anselmo; antes,
importunó a Lotario que se quedase y le aguardase, porque tenía que tratar
con él una cosa de mucha importancia. Dijo también a Camila que no dejase
solo a Lotario en tanto que él volviese. En efeto, él supo tan bien fingir
la necesidad, o necedad, de su ausencia, que nadie pudiera entender que era
fingida. Fuese Anselmo, y quedaron solos a la mesa Camila y Lotario, porque
la demás gente de casa toda se había ido a comer. Viose Lotario puesto en
la estacada que su amigo deseaba y con el enemigo delante, que pudiera
vencer con sola su hermosura a un escuadrón de caballeros armados: mirad si
era razón que le temiera Lotario.
»Pero lo que hizo fue poner el codo sobre el brazo de la silla y la mano
abierta en la mejilla, y, pidiendo perdón a Camila del mal comedimiento,
dijo que quería reposar un poco en tanto que Anselmo volvía. Camila le
respondió que mejor reposaría en el estrado que en la silla, y así, le rogó
se entrase a dormir en él. No quiso Lotario, y allí se quedó dormido hasta
que volvió Anselmo, el cual, como halló a Camila en su aposento y a Lotario
durmiendo, creyó que, como se había tardado tanto, ya habrían tenido los
dos lugar para hablar, y aun para dormir, y no vio la hora en que Lotario
despertase, para volverse con él fuera y preguntarle de su ventura.
»Todo le sucedió como él quiso: Lotario despertó, y luego salieron los dos
de casa, y así, le preguntó lo que deseaba, y le respondió Lotario que no
le había parecido ser bien que la primera vez se descubriese del todo; y
así, no había hecho otra cosa que alabar a Camila de hermosa, diciéndole
que en toda la ciudad no se trataba de otra cosa que de su hermosura y
discreción, y que éste le había parecido buen principio para entrar ganando
la voluntad, y disponiéndola a que otra vez le escuchase con gusto, usando
en esto del artificio que el demonio usa cuando quiere engañar a alguno que
está puesto en atalaya de mirar por sí: que se transforma en ángel de luz,
siéndolo él de tinieblas, y, poniéndole delante apariencias buenas, al cabo
descubre quién es y sale con su intención, si a los principios no es
descubierto su engaño. Todo esto le contentó mucho a Anselmo, y dijo que
cada día daría el mesmo lugar, aunque no saliese de casa, porque en ella se
ocuparía en cosas que Camila no pudiese venir en conocimiento de su
artificio.
»Sucedió, pues, que se pasaron muchos días que, sin decir Lotario palabra a
Camila, respondía a Anselmo que la hablaba y jamás podía sacar della una
pequeña muestra de venir en ninguna cosa que mala fuese, ni aun dar una
señal de sombra de esperanza; antes, decía que le amenazaba que si de aquel
mal pensamiento no se quitaba, que lo había de decir a su esposo.
»—Bien está —dijo Anselmo—. Hasta aquí ha resistido Camila a las palabras;
es menester ver cómo resiste a las obras: yo os daré mañana dos mil escudos
de oro para que se los ofrezcáis, y aun se los deis, y otros tantos para
que compréis joyas con que cebarla; que las mujeres suelen ser aficionadas,
y más si son hermosas, por más castas que sean, a esto de traerse bien y
andar galanas; y si ella resiste a esta tentación, yo quedaré satisfecho y
no os daré más pesadumbre.
»Lotario respondió que ya que había comenzado, que él llevaría hasta el fin
aquella empresa, puesto que entendía salir della cansado y vencido. Otro
día recibió los cuatro mil escudos, y con ellos cuatro mil confusiones,
porque no sabía qué decirse para mentir de nuevo; pero, en efeto, determinó
de decirle que Camila estaba tan entera a las dádivas y promesas como a las
palabras, y que no había para qué cansarse más, porque todo el tiempo se
gastaba en balde.
»Pero la suerte, que las cosas guiaba de otra manera, ordenó que, habiendo
dejado Anselmo solos a Lotario y a Camila, como otras veces solía, él se
encerró en un aposento y por los agujeros de la cerradura estuvo mirando y
escuchando lo que los dos trataban, y vio que en más de media hora Lotario
no habló palabra a Camila, ni se la hablara si allí estuviera un siglo, y
cayó en la cuenta de que cuanto su amigo le había dicho de las respuestas
de Camila todo era ficción y mentira. Y, para ver si esto era ansí, salió
del aposento, y, llamando a Lotario aparte, le preguntó qué nuevas había y
de qué temple estaba Camila. Lotario le respondió que no pensaba más darle
puntada en aquel negocio, porque respondía tan áspera y desabridamente, que
no tendría ánimo para volver a decirle cosa alguna.
»—¡Ah! —dijo Anselmo—, Lotario, Lotario, y cuán mal correspondes a lo que
me debes y a lo mucho que de ti confío! Ahora te he estado mirando por el
lugar que concede la entrada desta llave, y he visto que no has dicho
palabra a Camila, por donde me doy a entender que aun las primeras le
tienes por decir; y si esto es así, como sin duda lo es, ¿para qué me
engañas, o por qué quieres quitarme con tu industria los medios que yo
podría hallar para conseguir mi deseo?
»No dijo más Anselmo, pero bastó lo que había dicho para dejar corrido y
confuso a Lotario; el cual, casi como tomando por punto de honra el haber
sido hallado en mentira, juró a Anselmo que desde aquel momento tomaba tan
a su cargo el contentalle y no mentille, cual lo vería si con curiosidad lo
espiaba; cuanto más, que no sería menester usar de ninguna diligencia,
porque la que él pensaba poner en satisfacelle le quitaría de toda
sospecha. Creyóle Anselmo, y para dalle comodidad más segura y menos
sobresaltada, determinó de hacer ausencia de su casa por ocho días, yéndose
a la de un amigo suyo, que estaba en una aldea, no lejos de la ciudad, con
el cual amigo concertó que le enviase a llamar con muchas veras, para tener
ocasión con Camila de su partida.
»¡Desdichado y mal advertido de ti, Anselmo! ¿Qué es lo que haces? ¿Qué es
lo que trazas? ¿Qué es lo que ordenas? Mira que haces contra ti mismo,
trazando tu deshonra y ordenando tu perdición. Buena es tu esposa Camila,
quieta y sosegadamente la posees, nadie sobresalta tu gusto, sus
pensamientos no salen de las paredes de su casa, tú eres su cielo en la
tierra, el blanco de sus deseos, el cumplimiento de sus gustos y la medida
por donde mide su voluntad, ajustándola en todo con la tuya y con la del
cielo. Pues si la mina de su honor, hermosura, honestidad y recogimiento te
da sin ningún trabajo toda la riqueza que tiene y tú puedes desear, ¿para
qué quieres ahondar la tierra y buscar nuevas vetas de nuevo y nunca visto
tesoro, poniéndote a peligro que toda venga abajo, pues, en fin, se
sustenta sobre los débiles arrimos de su flaca naturaleza? Mira que el que
busca lo imposible es justo que lo posible se le niegue, como lo dijo mejor
un poeta, diciendo:
Busco en la muerte la vida,
salud en la enfermedad,
en la prisión libertad,
en lo cerrado salida
y en el traidor lealtad.
Pero mi suerte, de quien
jamás espero algún bien,
con el cielo ha estatuido
que, pues lo imposible pido,
lo posible aun no me den.
»Fuese otro día Anselmo a la aldea, dejando dicho a Camila que el tiempo
que él estuviese ausente vendría Lotario a mirar por su casa y a comer con
ella; que tuviese cuidado de tratalle como a su mesma persona. Afligióse
Camila, como mujer discreta y honrada, de la orden que su marido le dejaba,
y díjole que advirtiese que no estaba bien que nadie, él ausente, ocupase
la silla de su mesa, y que si lo hacía por no tener confianza que ella
sabría gobernar su casa, que probase por aquella vez, y vería por
experiencia como para mayores cuidados era bastante. Anselmo le replicó que
aquél era su gusto, y que no tenía más que hacer que bajar la cabeza y
obedecelle. Camila dijo que ansí lo haría, aunque contra su voluntad.
»Partióse Anselmo, y otro día vino a su casa Lotario, donde fue rescebido
de Camila con amoroso y honesto acogimiento; la cual jamás se puso en parte
donde Lotario la viese a solas, porque siempre andaba rodeada de sus
criados y criadas, especialmente de una doncella suya, llamada Leonela, a
quien ella mucho quería, por haberse criado desde niñas las dos juntas en
casa de los padres de Camila, y cuando se casó con Anselmo la trujo
consigo.
»En los tres días primeros nunca Lotario le dijo nada, aunque pudiera,
cuando se levantaban los manteles y la gente se iba a comer con mucha
priesa, porque así se lo tenía mandado Camila. Y aun tenía orden Leonela
que comiese primero que Camila, y que de su lado jamás se quitase; mas
ella, que en otras cosas de su gusto tenía puesto el pensamiento y había
menester aquellas horas y aquel lugar para ocuparle en sus contentos, no
cumplía todas veces el mandamiento de su señora; antes, los dejaba solos,
como si aquello le hubieran mandado. Mas la honesta presencia de Camila, la
gravedad de su rostro, la compostura de su persona era tanta, que ponía
freno a la lengua de Lotario.
»Pero el provecho que las muchas virtudes de Camila hicieron, poniendo
silencio en la lengua de Lotario, redundó más en daño de los dos, porque si
la lengua callaba, el pensamiento discurría y tenía lugar de contemplar,
parte por parte, todos los estremos de bondad y de hermosura que Camila
tenía, bastantes a enamorar una estatua de mármol, no que un corazón de
carne.
»Mirábala Lotario en el lugar y espacio que había de hablarla, y
consideraba cuán digna era de ser amada; y esta consideración comenzó poco
a poco a dar asaltos a los respectos que a Anselmo tenía, y mil veces quiso
ausentarse de la ciudad y irse donde jamás Anselmo le viese a él, ni él
viese a Camila; mas ya le hacía impedimento y detenía el gusto que hallaba
en mirarla. Hacíase fuerza y peleaba consigo mismo por desechar y no sentir
el contento que le llevaba a mirar a Camila. Culpábase a solas de su
desatino, llamábase mal amigo y aun mal cristiano; hacía discursos y
comparaciones entre él y Anselmo, y todos paraban en decir que más había
sido la locura y confianza de Anselmo que su poca fidelidad, y que si así
tuviera disculpa para con Dios como para con los hombres de lo que pensaba
hacer, que no temiera pena por su culpa.
»En efecto, la hermosura y la bondad de Camila, juntamente con la ocasión
que el ignorante marido le había puesto en las manos, dieron con la lealtad
de Lotario en tierra. Y, sin mirar a otra cosa que aquella a que su gusto
le inclinaba, al cabo de tres días de la ausencia de Anselmo, en los cuales
estuvo en continua batalla por resistir a sus deseos, comenzó a requebrar a
Camila, con tanta turbación y con tan amorosas razones que Camila quedó
suspensa, y no hizo otra cosa que levantarse de donde estaba y entrarse a
su aposento, sin respondelle palabra alguna. Mas no por esta sequedad se
desmayó en Lotario la esperanza, que siempre nace juntamente con el amor;
antes, tuvo en más a Camila. La cual, habiendo visto en Lotario lo que
jamás pensara, no sabía qué hacerse. Y, pareciéndole no ser cosa segura ni
bien hecha darle ocasión ni lugar a que otra vez la hablase, determinó de
enviar aquella mesma noche, como lo hizo, a un criado suyo con un billete a
Anselmo, donde le escribió estas razones:
Capítulo XXXIV. Donde se prosigue la novela del Curioso impertinente
»Así como suele decirse que parece mal el ejército sin su general y el
castillo sin su castellano, digo yo que parece muy peor la mujer casada y
moza sin su marido, cuando justísimas ocasiones no lo impiden. Yo me hallo
tan mal sin vos, y tan imposibilitada de no poder sufrir esta ausencia, que
si presto no venís, me habré de ir a entretener en casa de mis padres,
aunque deje sin guarda la vuestra; porque la que me dejastes, si es que
quedó con tal título, creo que mira más por su gusto que por lo que a vos
os toca; y, pues sois discreto, no tengo más que deciros, ni aun es bien
que más os diga.
»Esta carta recibió Anselmo, y entendió por ella que Lotario había ya
comenzado la empresa, y que Camila debía de haber respondido como él
deseaba; y, alegre sobremanera de tales nuevas, respondió a Camila, de
palabra, que no hiciese mudamiento de su casa en modo ninguno, porque él
volvería con mucha brevedad. Admirada quedó Camila de la respuesta de
Anselmo, que la puso en más confusión que primero, porque ni se atrevía a
estar en su casa, ni menos irse a la de sus padres; porque en la quedada
corría peligro su honestidad, y en la ida iba contra el mandamiento de su
esposo.
»En fin, se resolvió en lo que le estuvo peor, que fue en el quedarse, con
determinación de no huir la presencia de Lotario, por no dar que decir a
sus criados; y ya le pesaba de haber escrito lo que escribió a su esposo,
temerosa de que no pensase que Lotario había visto en ella alguna
desenvoltura que le hubiese movido a no guardalle el decoro que debía.
Pero, fiada en su bondad, se fió en Dios y en su buen pensamiento, con que
pensaba resistir callando a todo aquello que Lotario decirle quisiese, sin
dar más cuenta a su marido, por no ponerle en alguna pendencia y trabajo. Y
aun andaba buscando manera como disculpar a Lotario con Anselmo, cuando le
preguntase la ocasión que le había movido a escribirle aquel papel. Con
estos pensamientos, más honrados que acertados ni provechosos, estuvo otro
día escuchando a Lotario, el cual cargó la mano de manera que comenzó a
titubear la firmeza de Camila, y su honestidad tuvo harto que hacer en
acudir a los ojos, para que no diesen muestra de alguna amorosa compasión
que las lágrimas y las razones de Lotario en su pecho habían despertado.
Todo esto notaba Lotario, y todo le encendía.
»Finalmente, a él le pareció que era menester, en el espacio y lugar que
daba la ausencia de Anselmo, apretar el cerco a aquella fortaleza. Y así,
acometió a su presunción con las alabanzas de su hermosura, porque no hay
cosa que más presto rinda y allane las encastilladas torres de la vanidad
de las hermosas que la mesma vanidad, puesta en las lenguas de la
adulación. En efecto, él, con toda diligencia, minó la roca de su entereza,
con tales pertrechos que, aunque Camila fuera toda de bronce, viniera al
suelo. Lloró, rogó, ofreció, aduló, porfió, y fingió Lotario con tantos
sentimientos, con muestras de tantas veras, que dio al través con el recato
de Camila y vino a triunfar de lo que menos se pensaba y más deseaba.
»Rindióse Camila, Camila se rindió; pero, ¿qué mucho, si la amistad de
Lotario no quedó en pie? Ejemplo claro que nos muestra que sólo se vence la
pasión amorosa con huilla, y que nadie se ha de poner a brazos con tan
poderoso enemigo, porque es menester fuerzas divinas para vencer las suyas
humanas. Sólo supo Leonela la flaqueza de su señora, porque no se la
pudieron encubrir los dos malos amigos y nuevos amantes. No quiso Lotario
decir a Camila la pretensión de Anselmo, ni que él le había dado lugar para
llegar a aquel punto, porque no tuviese en menos su amor y pensase que así,
acaso y sin pensar, y no de propósito, la había solicitado.
»Volvió de allí a pocos días Anselmo a su casa, y no echó de ver lo que
faltaba en ella, que era lo que en menos tenía y más estimaba. Fuese luego
a ver a Lotario, y hallóle en su casa; abrazáronse los dos, y el uno
preguntó por las nuevas de su vida o de su muerte.
»—Las nuevas que te podré dar, ¡oh amigo Anselmo! —dijo Lotario—, son de
que tienes una mujer que dignamente puede ser ejemplo y corona de todas las
mujeres buenas. Las palabras que le he dicho se las ha llevado el aire, los
ofrecimientos se han tenido en poco, las dádivas no se han admitido, de
algunas lágrimas fingidas mías se ha hecho burla notable. En resolución,
así como Camila es cifra de toda belleza, es archivo donde asiste la
honestidad y vive el comedimiento y el recato, y todas las virtudes que
pueden hacer loable y bien afortunada a una honrada mujer. Vuelve a tomar
tus dineros, amigo, que aquí los tengo, sin haber tenido necesidad de tocar
a ellos; que la entereza de Camila no se rinde a cosas tan bajas como son
dádivas ni promesas. Conténtate, Anselmo, y no quieras hacer más pruebas de
las hechas; y, pues a pie enjuto has pasado el mar de las dificultades y
sospechas que de las mujeres suelen y pueden tenerse, no quieras entrar de
nuevo en el profundo piélago de nuevos inconvenientes, ni quieras hacer
experiencia con otro piloto de la bondad y fortaleza del navío que el cielo
te dio en suerte para que en él pasases la mar deste mundo, sino haz cuenta
que estás ya en seguro puerto, y aférrate con las áncoras de la buena
consideración, y déjate estar hasta que te vengan a pedir la deuda que no
hay hidalguía humana que de pagarla se escuse.
»Contentísimo quedó Anselmo de las razones de Lotario, y así se las creyó
como si fueran dichas por algún oráculo. Pero, con todo eso, le rogó que no
dejase la empresa, aunque no fuese más de por curiosidad y entretenimiento,
aunque no se aprovechase de allí adelante de tan ahincadas diligencias como
hasta entonces; y que sólo quería que le escribiese algunos versos en su
alabanza, debajo del nombre de Clori, porque él le daría a entender a
Camila que andaba enamorado de una dama, a quien le había puesto aquel
nombre por poder celebrarla con el decoro que a su honestidad se le debía;
y que, cuando Lotario no quisiera tomar trabajo de escribir los versos, que
él los haría.
»—No será menester eso —dijo Lotario—, pues no me son tan enemigas las
musas que algunos ratos del año no me visiten. Dile tú a Camila lo que has
dicho del fingimiento de mis amores, que los versos yo los haré; si no tan
buenos como el subjeto merece, serán, por lo menos, los mejores que yo
pudiere.
»Quedaron deste acuerdo el impertinente y el traidor amigo; y, vuelto
Anselmo a su casa, preguntó a Camila lo que ella ya se maravillaba que no
se lo hubiese preguntado: que fue que le dijese la ocasión por que le había
escrito el papel que le envió. Camila le respondió que le había parecido
que Lotario la miraba un poco más desenvueltamente que cuando él estaba en
casa; pero que ya estaba desengañada y creía que había sido imaginación
suya, porque ya Lotario huía de vella y de estar con ella a solas. Díjole
Anselmo que bien podía estar segura de aquella sospecha, porque él sabía
que Lotario andaba enamorado de una doncella principal de la ciudad, a
quien él celebraba debajo del nombre de Clori, y que, aunque no lo
estuviera, no había que temer de la verdad de Lotario y de la mucha amistad
de entrambos. Y, a no estar avisada Camila de Lotario de que eran fingidos
aquellos amores de Clori, y que él se lo había dicho a Anselmo por poder
ocuparse algunos ratos en las mismas alabanzas de Camila, ella, sin duda,
cayera en la desesperada red de los celos; mas, por estar ya advertida,
pasó aquel sobresalto sin pesadumbre.
»Otro día, estando los tres sobre mesa, rogó Anselmo a Lotario dijese
alguna cosa de las que había compuesto a su amada Clori; que, pues Camila
no la conocía, seguramente podía decir lo que quisiese.
»—Aunque la conociera —respondió Lotario—, no encubriera yo nada, porque
cuando algún amante loa a su dama de hermosa y la nota de cruel, ningún
oprobrio hace a su buen crédito. Pero, sea lo que fuere, lo que sé decir,
que ayer hice un soneto a la ingratitud desta Clori, que dice ansí:
Soneto
En el silencio de la noche, cuando
ocupa el dulce sueño a los mortales,
la pobre cuenta de mis ricos males
estoy al cielo y a mi Clori dando.
Y, al tiempo cuando el sol se va mostrando
por las rosadas puertas orientales,
con suspiros y acentos desiguales,
voy la antigua querella renovando.
Y cuando el sol, de su estrellado asiento,
derechos rayos a la tierra envía,
el llanto crece y doblo los gemidos.
Vuelve la noche, y vuelvo al triste cuento,
y siempre hallo, en mi mortal porfía,
al cielo, sordo; a Clori, sin oídos.
»Bien le pareció el soneto a Camila, pero mejor a Anselmo, pues le alabó, y
dijo que era demasiadamente cruel la dama que a tan claras verdades no
correspondía. A lo que dijo Camila:
»—Luego, ¿todo aquello que los poetas enamorados dicen es verdad?
»—En cuanto poetas, no la dicen —respondió Lotario—; mas, en cuanto
enamorados, siempre quedan tan cortos como verdaderos.
»—No hay duda deso —replicó Anselmo, todo por apoyar y acreditar los
pensamientos de Lotario con Camila, tan descuidada del artificio de Anselmo
como ya enamorada de Lotario.
»Y así, con el gusto que de sus cosas tenía, y más, teniendo por entendido
que sus deseos y escritos a ella se encaminaban, y que ella era la
verdadera Clori, le rogó que si otro soneto o otros versos sabía, los
dijese:
»—Sí sé —respondió Lotario—, pero no creo que es tan bueno como el primero,
o, por mejor decir, menos malo. Y podréislo bien juzgar, pues es éste:
Soneto
Yo sé que muero; y si no soy creído,
es más cierto el morir, como es más cierto
verme a tus pies, ¡oh bella ingrata!, muerto,
antes que de adorarte arrepentido.
Podré yo verme en la región de olvido,
de vida y gloria y de favor desierto,
y allí verse podrá en mi pecho abierto
cómo tu hermoso rostro está esculpido.
Que esta reliquia guardo para el duro
trance que me amenaza mi porfía,
que en tu mismo rigor se fortalece.
¡Ay de aquel que navega, el cielo escuro,
por mar no usado y peligrosa vía,
adonde norte o puerto no se ofrece!
»También alabó este segundo soneto Anselmo, como había hecho el primero, y
desta manera iba añadiendo eslabón a eslabón a la cadena con que se
enlazaba y trababa su deshonra, pues cuando más Lotario le deshonraba,
entonces le decía que estaba más honrado; y, con esto, todos los escalones
que Camila bajaba hacia el centro de su menosprecio, los subía, en la
opinión de su marido, hacia la cumbre de la virtud y de su buena fama.
»Sucedió en esto que, hallándose una vez, entre otras, sola Camila con su
doncella, le dijo:
»—Corrida estoy, amiga Leonela, de ver en cuán poco he sabido estimarme,
pues siquiera no hice que con el tiempo comprara Lotario la entera posesión
que le di tan presto de mi voluntad. Temo que ha de estimar mi presteza o
ligereza, sin que eche de ver la fuerza que él me hizo para no poder
resistirle.
»—No te dé pena eso, señora mía —respondió Leonela—, que no está la monta,
ni es causa para menguar la estimación, darse lo que se da presto, si, en
efecto, lo que se da es bueno, y ello por sí digno de estimarse. Y aun
suele decirse que el que luego da, da dos veces.
»—También se suele decir —dijo Camila— que lo que cuesta poco se estima en
menos.
»—No corre por ti esa razón —respondió Leonela—, porque el amor, según he
oído decir, unas veces vuela y otras anda, con éste corre y con aquél va
despacio, a unos entibia y a otros abrasa, a unos hiere y a otros mata, en
un mesmo punto comienza la carrera de sus deseos y en aquel mesmo punto la
acaba y concluye, por la mañana suele poner el cerco a una fortaleza y a la
noche la tiene rendida, porque no hay fuerza que le resista. Y, siendo así,
¿de qué te espantas, o de qué temes, si lo mismo debe de haber acontecido a
Lotario, habiendo tomado el amor por instrumento de rendirnos la ausencia
de mi señor? Y era forzoso que en ella se concluyese lo que el amor tenía
determinado, sin dar tiempo al tiempo para que Anselmo le tuviese de
volver, y con su presencia quedase imperfecta la obra. Porque el amor no
tiene otro mejor ministro para ejecutar lo que desea que es la ocasión: de
la ocasión se sirve en todos sus hechos, principalmente en los principios.
Todo esto sé yo muy bien, más de experiencia que de oídas, y algún día te
lo diré, señora, que yo también soy de carne y de sangre moza. Cuanto más,
señora Camila, que no te entregaste ni diste tan luego, que primero no
hubieses visto en los ojos, en los suspiros, en las razones y en las
promesas y dádivas de Lotario toda su alma, viendo en ella y en sus
virtudes cuán digno era Lotario de ser amado. Pues si esto es ansí, no te
asalten la imaginación esos escrupulosos y melindrosos pensamientos, sino
asegúrate que Lotario te estima como tú le estimas a él, y vive con
contento y satisfación de que, ya que caíste en el lazo amoroso, es el que
te aprieta de valor y de estima. Y que no sólo tiene las cuatro eses que
dicen que han de tener los buenos enamorados, sino todo un ABC entero: si
no, escúchame y verás como te le digo de coro. Él es, según yo veo y a mí
me parece, agradecido, bueno, caballero, dadivoso, enamorado, firme,
gallardo, honrado, ilustre, leal, mozo, noble, onesto, principal,
quantioso, rico, y las eses que dicen; y luego, tácito, verdadero. La X no
le cuadra, porque es letra áspera; la Y ya está dicha; la Z, zelador de tu
honra.
»Rióse Camila del ABC de su doncella, y túvola por más plática en las cosas
de amor que ella decía; y así lo confesó ella, descubriendo a Camila como
trataba amores con un mancebo bien nacido, de la mesma ciudad; de lo cual
se turbó Camila, temiendo que era aquél camino por donde su honra podía
correr riesgo. Apuróla si pasaban sus pláticas a más que serlo. Ella, con
poca vergüenza y mucha desenvoltura, le respondió que sí pasaban; porque es
cosa ya cierta que los descuidos de las señoras quitan la vergüenza a las
criadas, las cuales, cuando ven a las amas echar traspiés, no se les da
nada a ellas de cojear, ni de que lo sepan.
»No pudo hacer otra cosa Camila sino rogar a Leonela no dijese nada de su
hecho al que decía ser su amante, y que tratase sus cosas con secreto,
porque no viniesen a noticia de Anselmo ni de Lotario. Leonela respondió
que así lo haría, mas cumpliólo de manera que hizo cierto el temor de
Camila de que por ella había de perder su crédito. Porque la deshonesta y
atrevida Leonela, después que vio que el proceder de su ama no era el que
solía, atrevióse a entrar y poner dentro de casa a su amante, confiada que,
aunque su señora le viese, no había de osar descubrille; que este daño
acarrean, entre otros, los pecados de las señoras: que se hacen esclavas de
sus mesmas criadas y se obligan a encubrirles sus deshonestidades y
vilezas, como aconteció con Camila; que, aunque vio una y muchas veces que
su Leonela estaba con su galán en un aposento de su casa, no sólo no la
osaba reñir, mas dábale lugar a que lo encerrase, y quitábale todos los
estorbos, para que no fuese visto de su marido.
»Pero no los pudo quitar que Lotario no le viese una vez salir, al romper
del alba; el cual, sin conocer quién era, pensó primero que debía de ser
alguna fantasma; mas, cuando le vio caminar, embozarse y encubrirse con
cuidado y recato, cayó de su simple pensamiento y dio en otro, que fuera la
perdición de todos si Camila no lo remediara. Pensó Lotario que aquel
hombre que había visto salir tan a deshora de casa de Anselmo no había
entrado en ella por Leonela, ni aun se acordó si Leonela era en el mundo;
sólo creyó que Camila, de la misma manera que había sido fácil y ligera con
él, lo era para otro; que estas añadiduras trae consigo la maldad de la
mujer mala: que pierde el crédito de su honra con el mesmo a quien se
entregó rogada y persuadida, y cree que con mayor facilidad se entrega a
otros, y da infalible crédito a cualquiera sospecha que desto le venga. Y
no parece sino que le faltó a Lotario en este punto todo su buen
entendimiento, y se le fueron de la memoria todos sus advertidos discursos,
pues, sin hacer alguno que bueno fuese, ni aun razonable, sin más ni más,
antes que Anselmo se levantase, impaciente y ciego de la celosa rabia que
las entrañas le roía, muriendo por vengarse de Camila, que en ninguna cosa
le había ofendido, se fue a Anselmo y le dijo:
»—Sábete, Anselmo, que ha muchos días que he andado peleando conmigo mesmo,
haciéndome fuerza a no decirte lo que ya no es posible ni justo que más te
encubra. Sábete que la fortaleza de Camila está ya rendida y sujeta a todo
aquello que yo quisiere hacer della; y si he tardado en descubrirte esta
verdad, ha sido por ver si era algún liviano antojo suyo, o si lo hacía por
probarme y ver si eran con propósito firme tratados los amores que, con tu
licencia, con ella he comenzado. Creí, ansimismo, que ella, si fuera la que
debía y la que entrambos pensábamos, ya te hubiera dado cuenta de mi
solicitud, pero, habiendo visto que se tarda, conozco que son verdaderas
las promesas que me ha dado de que, cuando otra vez hagas ausencia de tu
casa, me hablará en la recámara, donde está el repuesto de tus alhajas —y
era la verdad, que allí le solía hablar Camila—; y no quiero que
precipitosamente corras a hacer alguna venganza, pues no está aún cometido
el pecado sino con pensamiento, y podría ser que, desde éste hasta el
tiempo de ponerle por obra, se mudase el de Camila y naciese en su lugar el
arrepentimiento. Y así, ya que, en todo o en parte, has seguido siempre mis
consejos, sigue y guarda uno que ahora te diré, para que sin engaño y con
medroso advertimento te satisfagas de aquello que más vieres que te
convenga. Finge que te ausentas por dos o tres días, como otras veces
sueles, y haz de manera que te quedes escondido en tu recámara, pues los
tapices que allí hay y otras cosas con que te puedas encubrir te ofrecen
mucha comodidad, y entonces verás por tus mismos ojos, y yo por los míos,
lo que Camila quiere; y si fuere la maldad que se puede temer antes que
esperar, con silencio, sagacidad y discreción podrás ser el verdugo de tu
agravio.
»Absorto, suspenso y admirado quedó Anselmo con las razones de Lotario,
porque le cogieron en tiempo donde menos las esperaba oír, porque ya tenía
a Camila por vencedora de los fingidos asaltos de Lotario y comenzaba a
gozar la gloria del vencimiento. Callando estuvo por un buen espacio,
mirando al suelo sin mover pestaña, y al cabo dijo:
»—Tú lo has hecho, Lotario, como yo esperaba de tu amistad; en todo he de
seguir tu consejo: haz lo que quisieres y guarda aquel secreto que ves que
conviene en caso tan no pensado.
»Prometióselo Lotario, y, en apartándose dél, se arrepintió totalmente de
cuanto le había dicho, viendo cuán neciamente había andado, pues pudiera él
vengarse de Camila, y no por camino tan cruel y tan deshonrado. Maldecía su
entendimiento, afeaba su ligera determinación, y no sabía qué medio tomarse
para deshacer lo hecho, o para dalle alguna razonable salida. Al fin,
acordó de dar cuenta de todo a Camila; y, como no faltaba lugar para
poderlo hacer, aquel mismo día la halló sola, y ella, así como vio que le
podía hablar, le dijo.
»—Sabed, amigo Lotario, que tengo una pena en el corazón que me le aprieta
de suerte que parece que quiere reventar en el pecho, y ha de ser maravilla
si no lo hace, pues ha llegado la desvergüenza de Leonela a tanto, que cada
noche encierra a un galán suyo en esta casa y se está con él hasta el día,
tan a costa de mi crédito cuanto le quedará campo abierto de juzgarlo al
que le viere salir a horas tan inusitadas de mi casa. Y lo que me fatiga es
que no la puedo castigar ni reñir: que el ser ella secretario de nuestros
tratos me ha puesto un freno en la boca para callar los suyos, y temo que
de aquí ha de nacer algún mal suceso.
»Al principio que Camila esto decía creyó Lotario que era artificio para
desmentille que el hombre que había visto salir era de Leonela, y no suyo;
pero, viéndola llorar y afligirse, y pedirle remedio, vino a creer la
verdad, y, en creyéndola, acabó de estar confuso y arrepentido del todo.
Pero, con todo esto, respondió a Camila que no tuviese pena, que él
ordenaría remedio para atajar la insolencia de Leonela. Díjole asimismo lo
que, instigado de la furiosa rabia de los celos, había dicho a Anselmo, y
cómo estaba concertado de esconderse en la recámara, para ver desde allí a
la clara la poca lealtad que ella le guardaba. Pidióle perdón desta locura,
y consejo para poder remedialla y salir bien de tan revuelto laberinto como
su mal discurso le había puesto.
»Espantada quedó Camila de oír lo que Lotario le decía, y con mucho enojo y
muchas y discretas razones le riñó y afeó su mal pensamiento y la simple y
mala determinación que había tenido. Pero, como naturalmente tiene la mujer
ingenio presto para el bien y para el mal más que el varón, puesto que le
va faltando cuando de propósito se pone a hacer discursos, luego al
instante halló Camila el modo de remediar tan al parecer inremediable
negocio, y dijo a Lotario que procurase que otro día se escondiese Anselmo
donde decía, porque ella pensaba sacar de su escondimiento comodidad para
que desde allí en adelante los dos se gozasen sin sobresalto alguno; y, sin
declararle del todo su pensamiento, le advirtió que tuviese cuidado que, en
estando Anselmo escondido, él viniese cuando Leonela le llamase, y que a
cuanto ella le dijese le respondiese como respondiera aunque no supiera que
Anselmo le escuchaba. Porfió Lotario que le acabase de declarar su
intención, porque con más seguridad y aviso guardase todo lo que viese ser
necesario.
»—Digo —dijo Camila— que no hay más que guardar, si no fuere responderme
como yo os preguntare (no queriendo Camila darle antes cuenta de lo que
pensaba hacer, temerosa que no quisiese seguir el parecer que a ella tan
bueno le parecía, y siguiese o buscase otros que no podrían ser tan
buenos).
»Con esto, se fue Lotario; y Anselmo, otro día, con la escusa de ir aquella
aldea de su amigo, se partió y volvió a esconderse: que lo pudo hacer con
comodidad, porque de industria se la dieron Camila y Leonela.
»Escondido, pues, Anselmo, con aquel sobresalto que se puede imaginar que
tendría el que esperaba ver por sus ojos hacer notomía de las entrañas de
su honra, íbase a pique de perder el sumo bien que él pensaba que tenía en
su querida Camila. Seguras ya y ciertas Camila y Leonela que Anselmo estaba
escondido, entraron en la recámara; y apenas hubo puesto los pies en ella
Camilia, cuando, dando un grande suspiro, dijo:
»—¡Ay, Leonela amiga! ¿No sería mejor que, antes que llegase a poner en
ejecución lo que no quiero que sepas, porque no procures estorbarlo, que
tomases la daga de Anselmo, que te he pedido, y pasases con ella este
infame pecho mío? Pero no hagas tal, que no será razón que yo lleve la pena
de la ajena culpa. Primero quiero saber qué es lo que vieron en mí los
atrevidos y deshonestos ojos de Lotario que fuese causa de darle
atrevimiento a descubrirme un tan mal deseo como es el que me ha
descubierto, en desprecio de su amigo y en deshonra mía. Ponte, Leonela, a
esa ventana y llámale, que, sin duda alguna, él debe de estar en la calle,
esperando poner en efeto su mala intención. Pero primero se pondrá la cruel
cuanto honrada mía.
»—¡Ay, señora mía! —respondió la sagaz y advertida Leonela—, y ¿qué es lo
que quieres hacer con esta daga? ¿Quieres por ventura quitarte la vida o
quitársela a Lotario? Que cualquiera destas cosas que quieras ha de
redundar en pérdida de tu crédito y fama. Mejor es que disimules tu
agravio, y no des lugar a que este mal hombre entre ahora en esta casa y
nos halle solas. Mira, señora, que somos flacas mujeres, y él es hombre y
determinado; y, como viene con aquel mal propósito, ciego y apasionado,
quizá antes que tú pongas en ejecución el tuyo, hará él lo que te estaría
más mal que quitarte la vida. ¡Mal haya mi señor Anselmo, que tanto mal ha
querido dar a este desuellacaras en su casa! Y ya, señora, que le mates,
como yo pienso que quieres hacer, ¿qué hemos de hacer dél después de
muerto?
»—¿Qué, amiga? —respondió Camila—: dejarémosle para que Anselmo le
entierre, pues será justo que tenga por descanso el trabajo que tomare en
poner debajo de la tierra su misma infamia. Llámale, acaba, que todo el
tiempo que tardo en tomar la debida venganza de mi agravio parece que
ofendo a la lealtad que a mi esposo debo.
»Todo esto escuchaba Anselmo, y, a cada palabra que Camila decía, se le
mudaban los pensamientos; mas, cuando entendió que estaba resuelta en matar
a Lotario, quiso salir y descubrirse, porque tal cosa no se hiciese; pero
detúvole el deseo de ver en qué paraba tanta gallardía y honesta
resolución, con propósito de salir a tiempo que la estorbase.
»Tomóle en esto a Camila un fuerte desmayo, y, arrojándose encima de una
cama que allí estaba, comenzó Leonela a llorar muy amargamente y a decir:
»—¡Ay, desdichada de mí si fuese tan sin ventura que se me muriese aquí
entre mis brazos la flor de la honestidad del mundo, la corona de las
buenas mujeres, el ejemplo de la castidad...!
»Con otras cosas a éstas semejantes, que ninguno la escuchara que no la
tuviera por la más lastimada y leal doncella del mundo, y a su señora por
otra nueva y perseguida Penélope. Poco tardó en volver de su desmayo
Camila; y, al volver en sí, dijo:
»—¿Por qué no vas, Leonela, a llamar al más leal amigo de amigo que vio el
sol o cubrió la noche? Acaba, corre, aguija, camina, no se esfogue con la
tardanza el fuego de la cólera que tengo, y se pase en amenazas y
maldiciones la justa venganza que espero.
»—Ya voy a llamarle, señora mía —dijo Leonela—, mas hasme de dar primero
esa daga, porque no hagas cosa, en tanto que falto, que dejes con ella que
llorar toda la vida a todos los que bien te quieren.
»—Ve segura, Leonela amiga, que no haré —respondió Camila—; porque, ya que
sea atrevida y simple a tu parecer en volver por mi honra, no lo he de ser
tanto como aquella Lucrecia de quien dicen que se mató sin haber cometido
error alguno, y sin haber muerto primero a quien tuvo la causa de su
desgracia. Yo moriré, si muero, pero ha de ser vengada y satisfecha del que
me ha dado ocasión de venir a este lugar a llorar sus atrevimientos,
nacidos tan sin culpa mía.
»Mucho se hizo de rogar Leonela antes que saliese a llamar a Lotario, pero,
en fin, salió; y, entre tanto que volvía, quedó Camilia diciendo, como que
hablaba consigo misma:
»—¡Válame Dios! ¿No fuera más acertado haber despedido a Lotario, como
otras muchas veces lo he hecho, que no ponerle en condición, como ya le he
puesto, que me tenga por deshonesta y mala, siquiera este tiempo que he de
tardar en desengañarle? Mejor fuera, sin duda; pero no quedara yo vengada,
ni la honra de mi marido satisfecha, si tan a manos lavadas y tan a paso
llano se volviera a salir de donde sus malos pensamientos le entraron.
Pague el traidor con la vida lo que intentó con tan lascivo deseo: sepa el
mundo, si acaso llegare a saberlo, de que Camila no sólo guardó la lealtad
a su esposo, sino que le dio venganza del que se atrevió a ofendelle. Mas,
con todo, creo que fuera mejor dar cuenta desto a Anselmo, pero ya se la
apunté a dar en la carta que le escribí al aldea, y creo que el no acudir
él al remedio del daño que allí le señalé, debió de ser que, de puro bueno
y confiado, no quiso ni pudo creer que en el pecho de su tan firme amigo
pudiese caber género de pensamiento que contra su honra fuese; ni aun yo lo
creí después, por muchos días, ni lo creyera jamás, si su insolencia no
llegara a tanto, que las manifiestas dádivas y las largas promesas y las
continuas lágrimas no me lo manifestaran. Mas, ¿para qué hago yo ahora
estos discursos? ¿Tiene, por ventura, una resulución gallarda necesidad de
consejo alguno? No, por cierto. ¡Afuera, pues, traidores; aquí, venganzas!
¡Entre el falso, venga, llegue, muera y acabe, y suceda lo que sucediere!
Limpia entré en poder del que el cielo me dio por mío, limpia he de salir
dél; y, cuando mucho, saldré bañada en mi casta sangre, y en la impura del
más falso amigo que vio la amistad en el mundo.
»Y, diciendo esto, se paseaba por la sala con la daga desenvainada, dando
tan desconcertados y desaforados pasos, y haciendo tales ademanes, que no
parecía sino que le faltaba el juicio, y que no era mujer delicada, sino un
rufián desesperado.
»Todo lo miraba Anselmo, cubierto detrás de unos tapices donde se había
escondido, y de todo se admiraba, y ya le parecía que lo que había visto y
oído era bastante satisfación para mayores sospechas; y ya quisiera que la
prueba de venir Lotario faltara, temeroso de algún mal repentino suceso. Y,
estando ya para manifestarse y salir, para abrazar y desengañar a su
esposa, se detuvo porque vio que Leonela volvía con Lotario de la mano; y,
así como Camila le vio, haciendo con la daga en el suelo una gran raya
delante della, le dijo:
»—Lotario, advierte lo que te digo: si a dicha te atrevieres a pasar desta
raya que ves, ni aun llegar a ella, en el punto que viere que lo intentas,
en ese mismo me pasaré el pecho con esta daga que en las manos tengo. Y,
antes que a esto me respondas palabra, quiero que otras algunas me
escuches; que después responderás lo que más te agradare. Lo primero,
quiero, Lotario, que me digas si conoces a Anselmo, mi marido, y en qué
opinión le tienes; y lo segundo, quiero saber también si me conoces a mí.
Respóndeme a esto, y no te turbes, ni pienses mucho lo que has de
responder, pues no son dificultades las que te pregunto.
»No era tan ignorante Lotario que, desde el primer punto que Camila le dijo
que hiciese esconder a Anselmo, no hubiese dado en la cuenta de lo que ella
pensaba hacer; y así, correspondió con su intención tan discretamente, y
tan a tiempo, que hicieran los dos pasar aquella mentira por más que cierta
verdad; y así, respondió a Camila desta manera:
»—No pensé yo, hermosa Camila, que me llamabas para preguntarme cosas tan
fuera de la intención con que yo aquí vengo. Si lo haces por dilatarme la
prometida merced, desde más lejos pudieras entretenerla, porque tanto más
fatiga el bien deseado cuanto la esperanza está más cerca de poseello;
pero, porque no digas que no respondo a tus preguntas, digo que conozco a
tu esposo Anselmo, y nos conocemos los dos desde nuestros más tiernos años;
y no quiero decir lo que tú tan bien sabes de nuestra amistad, por no me
hacer testigo del agravio que el amor hace que le haga, poderosa disculpa
de mayores yerros. A ti te conozco y tengo en la misma posesión que él te
tiene; que, a no ser así, por menos prendas que las tuyas no había yo de ir
contra lo que debo a ser quien soy y contra las santas leyes de la
verdadera amistad, ahora por tan poderoso enemigo como el amor por mí
rompidas y violadas.
»—Si eso confiesas —respondió Camila—, enemigo mortal de todo aquello que
justamente merece ser amado, ¿con qué rostro osas parecer ante quien sabes
que es el espejo donde se mira aquel en quien tú te debieras mirar, para
que vieras con cuán poca ocasión le agravias? Pero ya cayo, ¡ay, desdichada
de mí!, en la cuenta de quién te ha hecho tener tan poca con lo que a ti
mismo debes, que debe de haber sido alguna desenvoltura mía, que no quiero
llamarla deshonestidad, pues no habrá procedido de deliberada
determinación, sino de algún descuido de los que las mujeres que piensan
que no tienen de quién recatarse suelen hacer inadvertidamente. Si no,
dime: ¿cuándo, ¡oh traidor!, respondí a tus ruegos con alguna palabra o
señal que pudiese despertar en ti alguna sombra de esperanza de cumplir tus
infames deseos? ¿Cuándo tus amorosas palabras no fueron deshechas y
reprehendidas de las mías con rigor y con aspereza? ¿Cuándo tus muchas
promesas y mayores dádivas fueron de mí creídas, ni admitidas? Pero, por
parecerme que alguno no puede perseverar en el intento amoroso luengo
tiempo, si no es sustentado de alguna esperanza, quiero atribuirme a mí la
culpa de tu impertinencia, pues, sin duda, algún descuido mío ha sustentado
tanto tiempo tu cuidado; y así, quiero castigarme y darme la pena que tu
culpa merece. Y, porque vieses que, siendo conmigo tan inhumana, no era
posible dejar de serlo contigo, quise traerte a ser testigo del sacrificio
que pienso hacer a la ofendida honra de mi tan honrado marido, agraviado de
ti con el mayor cuidado que te ha sido posible, y de mí también con el poco
recato que he tenido del huir la ocasión, si alguna te di, para favorecer y
canonizar tus malas intenciones. Torno a decir que la sospecha que tengo
que algún descuido mío engendró en ti tan desvariados pensamientos es la
que más me fatiga, y la que yo más deseo castigar con mis propias manos,
porque, castigándome otro verdugo, quizá sería más pública mi culpa; pero,
antes que esto haga, quiero matar muriendo, y llevar conmigo quien me acabe
de satisfacer el deseo de la venganza que espero y tengo, viendo allá,
dondequiera que fuere, la pena que da la justicia desinteresada y que no se
dobla al que en términos tan desesperados me ha puesto.
»Y, diciendo estas razones, con una increíble fuerza y ligereza arremetió a
Lotario con la daga desenvainada, con tales muestras de querer enclavársela
en el pecho, que casi él estuvo en duda si aquellas demostraciones eran
falsas o verdaderas, porque le fue forzoso valerse de su industria y de su
fuerza para estorbar que Camila no le diese. La cual tan vivamente fingía
aquel estraño embuste y fealdad que, por dalle color de verdad, la quiso
matizar con su misma sangre; porque, viendo que no podía haber a Lotario, o
fingiendo que no podía, dijo:
»—Pues la suerte no quiere satisfacer del todo mi tan justo deseo, a lo
menos, no será tan poderosa que, en parte, me quite que no le satisfaga.
Y, haciendo fuerza para soltar la mano de la daga, que Lotario la tenía
asida, la sacó, y, guiando su punta por parte que pudiese herir no
profundamente, se la entró y escondió por más arriba de la islilla del lado
izquierdo, junto al hombro, y luego se dejó caer en el suelo, como
desmayada.
»Estaban Leonela y Lotario suspensos y atónitos de tal suceso, y todavía
dudaban de la verdad de aquel hecho, viendo a Camila tendida en tierra y
bañada en su sangre. Acudió Lotario con mucha presteza, despavorido y sin
aliento, a sacar la daga, y, en ver la pequeña herida, salió del temor que
hasta entonces tenía, y de nuevo se admiró de la sagacidad, prudencia y
mucha discreción de la hermosa Camila; y, por acudir con lo que a él le
tocaba, comenzó a hacer una larga y triste lamentación sobre el cuerpo de
Camila, como si estuviera difunta, echándose muchas maldiciones, no sólo a
él, sino al que había sido causa de habelle puesto en aquel término. Y,
como sabía que le escuchaba su amigo Anselmo, decía cosas que el que le
oyera le tuviera mucha más lástima que a Camila, aunque por muerta la
juzgara.
»Leonela la tomó en brazos y la puso en el lecho, suplicando a Lotario
fuese a buscar quien secretamente a Camila curase; pedíale asimismo consejo
y parecer de lo que dirían a Anselmo de aquella herida de su señora, si
acaso viniese antes que estuviese sana. Él respondió que dijesen lo que
quisiesen, que él no estaba para dar consejo que de provecho fuese; sólo le
dijo que procurase tomarle la sangre, porque él se iba adonde gentes no le
viesen. Y, con muestras de mucho dolor y sentimiento, se salió de casa; y,
cuando se vio solo y en parte donde nadie le veía, no cesaba de hacerse
cruces, maravillándose de la industria de Camila y de los ademanes tan
proprios de Leonela. Consideraba cuán enterado había de quedar Anselmo de
que tenía por mujer a una segunda Porcia, y deseaba verse con él para
celebrar los dos la mentira y la verdad más disimulada que jamás pudiera
imaginarse.
»Leonela tomó, como se ha dicho, la sangre a su señora, que no era más de
aquello que bastó para acreditar su embuste; y, lavando con un poco de vino
la herida, se la ató lo mejor que supo, diciendo tales razones, en tanto
que la curaba, que, aunque no hubieran precedido otras, bastaran a hacer
creer a Anselmo que tenía en Camila un simulacro de la honestidad.
»Juntáronse a las palabras de Leonela otras de Camila, llamándose cobarde y
de poco ánimo, pues le había faltado al tiempo que fuera más necesario
tenerle, para quitarse la vida, que tan aborrecida tenía. Pedía consejo a
su doncella si daría, o no, todo aquel suceso a su querido esposo; la cual
le dijo que no se lo dijese, porque le pondría en obligación de vengarse de
Lotario, lo cual no podría ser sin mucho riesgo suyo, y que la buena mujer
estaba obligada a no dar ocasión a su marido a que riñese, sino a quitalle
todas aquellas que le fuese posible.
»Respondió Camila que le parecía muy bien su parecer y que ella le
seguiría; pero que en todo caso convenía buscar qué decir a Anselmo de la
causa de aquella herida, que él no podría dejar de ver; a lo que Leonela
respondía que ella, ni aun burlando, no sabía mentir.
»—Pues yo, hermana —replicó Camila—, ¿qué tengo de saber, que no me
atreveré a forjar ni sustentar una mentira, si me fuese en ello la vida? Y
si es que no hemos de saber dar salida a esto, mejor será decirle la verdad
desnuda, que no que nos alcance en mentirosa cuenta.
»—No tengas pena, señora: de aquí a mañana —respondió Leonela— yo pensaré
qué le digamos, y quizá que, por ser la herida donde es, la podrás
encubrir sin que él la vea, y el cielo será servido de favorecer a nuestros
tan justos y tan honrados pensamientos. Sosiégate, señora mía, y procura
sosegar tu alteración, porque mi señor no te halle sobresaltada, y lo demás
déjalo a mi cargo, y al de Dios, que siempre acude a los buenos deseos.
»Atentísimo había estado Anselmo a escuchar y a ver representar la tragedia
de la muerte de su honra; la cual con tan estraños y eficaces afectos la
representaron los personajes della, que pareció que se habían transformado
en la misma verdad de lo que fingían. Deseaba mucho la noche, y el tener
lugar para salir de su casa, y ir a verse con su buen amigo Lotario,
congratulándose con él de la margarita preciosa que había hallado en el
desengaño de la bondad de su esposa. Tuvieron cuidado las dos de darle
lugar y comodidad a que saliese, y él, sin perdella, salió y luego fue a
buscar a Lotario, el cual hallado, no se puede buenamente contar los
abrazos que le dio, las cosas que de su contento le dijo, las alabanzas que
dio a Camila. Todo lo cual escuchó Lotario sin poder dar muestras de alguna
alegría, porque se le representaba a la memoria cuán engañado estaba su
amigo y cuán injustamente él le agraviaba. Y, aunque Anselmo veía que
Lotario no se alegraba, creía ser la causa por haber dejado a Camila herida
y haber él sido la causa; y así, entre otras razones, le dijo que no
tuviese pena del suceso de Camila, porque, sin duda, la herida era ligera,
pues quedaban de concierto de encubrírsela a él; y que, según esto, no
había de qué temer, sino que de allí adelante se gozase y alegrase con él,
pues por su industria y medio él se veía levantado a la más alta felicidad
que acertara desearse, y quería que no fuesen otros sus entretenimientos
que en hacer versos en alabanza de Camila, que la hiciesen eterna en la
memoria de los siglos venideros. Lotario alabó su buena determinación y
dijo que él, por su parte, ayudaría a levantar tan ilustre edificio.
»Con esto quedó Anselmo el hombre más sabrosamente engañado que pudo haber
en el mundo: él mismo llevó por la mano a su casa, creyendo que llevaba el
instrumento de su gloria, toda la perdición de su fama. Recebíale Camila
con rostro, al parecer, torcido, aunque con alma risueña. Duró este engaño
algunos días, hasta que, al cabo de pocos meses, volvió Fortuna su rueda y
salió a plaza la maldad con tanto artificio hasta allí cubierta, y a
Anselmo le costó la vida su impertinente curiosidad.»
Capítulo XXXV. Donde se da fin a la novela del Curioso impertinente
Poco más quedaba por leer de la novela, cuando del caramanchón donde
reposaba don Quijote salió Sancho Panza todo alborotado, diciendo a voces:
— Acudid, señores, presto y socorred a mi señor, que anda envuelto en la más
reñida y trabada batalla que mis ojos han visto. ¡Vive Dios, que ha dado
una cuchillada al gigante enemigo de la señora princesa Micomicona, que le
ha tajado la cabeza, cercen a cercen, como si fuera un nabo!
— ¿Qué dices, hermano? —dijo el cura, dejando de leer lo que de la novela
quedaba—. ¿Estáis en vos, Sancho? ¿Cómo diablos puede ser eso que decís,
estando el gigante dos mil leguas de aquí?
En esto, oyeron un gran ruido en el aposento, y que don Quijote decía a
voces:
— ¡Tente, ladrón, malandrín, follón, que aquí te tengo, y no te ha de valer
tu cimitarra!
Y parecía que daba grandes cuchilladas por las paredes. Y dijo Sancho:
— No tienen que pararse a escuchar, sino entren a despartir la pelea, o a
ayudar a mi amo; aunque ya no será menester, porque, sin duda alguna, el
gigante está ya muerto, y dando cuenta a Dios de su pasada y mala vida, que
yo vi correr la sangre por el suelo, y la cabeza cortada y caída a un lado,
que es tamaña como un gran cuero de vino.
— Que me maten —dijo a esta sazón el ventero— si don Quijote, o don diablo,
no ha dado alguna cuchillada en alguno de los cueros de vino tinto que a su
cabecera estaban llenos, y el vino derramado debe de ser lo que le parece
sangre a este buen hombre.
Y, con esto, entró en el aposento, y todos tras él, y hallaron a don
Quijote en el más estraño traje del mundo: estaba en camisa, la cual no era
tan cumplida que por delante le acabase de cubrir los muslos, y por detrás
tenía seis dedos menos; las piernas eran muy largas y flacas, llenas de
vello y no nada limpias; tenía en la cabeza un bonetillo colorado,
grasiento, que era del ventero; en el brazo izquierdo tenía revuelta la
manta de la cama, con quien tenía ojeriza Sancho, y él se sabía bien el
porqué; y en la derecha, desenvainada la espada, con la cual daba
cuchilladas a todas partes, diciendo palabras como si verdaderamente
estuviera peleando con algún gigante. Y es lo bueno que no tenía los ojos
abiertos, porque estaba durmiendo y soñando que estaba en batalla con el
gigante; que fue tan intensa la imaginación de la aventura que iba a
fenecer, que le hizo soñar que ya había llegado al reino de Micomicón, y
que ya estaba en la pelea con su enemigo. Y había dado tantas cuchilladas
en los cueros, creyendo que las daba en el gigante, que todo el aposento
estaba lleno de vino; lo cual visto por el ventero, tomó tanto enojo que
arremetió con don Quijote, y a puño cerrado le comenzó a dar tantos golpes
que si Cardenio y el cura no se le quitaran, él acabara la guerra del
gigante; y, con todo aquello, no despertaba el pobre caballero, hasta que
el barbero trujo un gran caldero de agua fría del pozo y se le echó por
todo el cuerpo de golpe, con lo cual despertó don Quijote; mas no con tanto
acuerdo que echase de ver de la manera que estaba.
Dorotea, que vio cuán corta y sotilmente estaba vestido, no quiso entrar a
ver la batalla de su ayudador y de su contrario.
Andaba Sancho buscando la cabeza del gigante por todo el suelo, y, como no
la hallaba, dijo:
— Ya yo sé que todo lo desta casa es encantamento; que la otra vez, en este
mesmo lugar donde ahora me hallo, me dieron muchos mojicones y porrazos,
sin saber quién me los daba, y nunca pude ver a nadie; y ahora no parece
por aquí esta cabeza que vi cortar por mis mismísimos ojos, y la sangre
corría del cuerpo como de una fuente.
— ¿Qué sangre ni qué fuente dices, enemigo de Dios y de sus santos? —dijo el
ventero—. ¿No vees, ladrón, que la sangre y la fuente no es otra cosa que
estos cueros que aquí están horadados y el vino tinto que nada en este
aposento, que nadando vea yo el alma en los infiernos de quien los horadó?
— No sé nada —respondió Sancho—; sólo sé que vendré a ser tan desdichado
que, por no hallar esta cabeza, se me ha de deshacer mi condado como la sal
en el agua.
Y estaba peor Sancho despierto que su amo durmiendo: tal le tenían las
promesas que su amo le había hecho. El ventero se desesperaba de ver la
flema del escudero y el maleficio del señor, y juraba que no había de ser
como la vez pasada, que se le fueron sin pagar; y que ahora no le habían de
valer los previlegios de su caballería para dejar de pagar lo uno y lo
otro, aun hasta lo que pudiesen costar las botanas que se habían de echar a
los rotos cueros.
Tenía el cura de las manos a don Quijote, el cual, creyendo que ya había
acabado la aventura, y que se hallaba delante de la princesa Micomicona, se
hincó de rodillas delante del cura, diciendo:
— Bien puede la vuestra grandeza, alta y famosa señora, vivir, de hoy más,
segura que le pueda hacer mal esta mal nacida criatura; y yo también, de
hoy más, soy quito de la palabra que os di, pues, con el ayuda del alto
Dios y con el favor de aquella por quien yo vivo y respiro, tan bien la he
cumplido.
— ¿No lo dije yo? —dijo oyendo esto Sancho—. Sí que no estaba yo borracho:
¡mirad si tiene puesto ya en sal mi amo al gigante! ¡Ciertos son los toros:
mi condado está de molde!
¿Quién no había de reír con los disparates de los dos, amo y mozo? Todos
reían sino el ventero, que se daba a Satanás. Pero, en fin, tanto hicieron
el barbero, Cardenio y el cura que, con no poco trabajo, dieron con don
Quijote en la cama, el cual se quedó dormido, con muestras de grandísimo
cansancio. Dejáronle dormir, y saliéronse al portal de la venta a consolar
a Sancho Panza de no haber hallado la cabeza del gigante; aunque más
tuvieron que hacer en aplacar al ventero, que estaba desesperado por la
repentina muerte de sus cueros. Y la ventera decía en voz y en grito:
— En mal punto y en hora menguada entró en mi casa este caballero andante,
que nunca mis ojos le hubieran visto, que tan caro me cuesta. La vez pasada
se fue con el costo de una noche, de cena, cama, paja y cebada, para él y
para su escudero, y un rocín y un jumento, diciendo que era caballero
aventurero (que mala ventura le dé Dios a él y a cuantos aventureros hay en
el mundo) y que por esto no estaba obligado a pagar nada, que así estaba
escrito en los aranceles de la caballería andantesca. Y ahora, por su
respeto, vino estotro señor y me llevó mi cola, y hámela vuelto con más de
dos cuartillos de daño, toda pelada, que no puede servir para lo que la
quiere mi marido. Y, por fin y remate de todo, romperme mis cueros y
derramarme mi vino; que derramada le vea yo su sangre. ¡Pues no se piense;
que, por los huesos de mi padre y por el siglo de mi madre, si no me lo han
de pagar un cuarto sobre otro, o no me llamaría yo como me llamo ni sería
hija de quien soy!
Estas y otras razones tales decía la ventera con grande enojo, y ayudábala
su buena criada Maritornes. La hija callaba, y de cuando en cuando se
sonreía. El cura lo sosegó todo, prometiendo de satisfacerles su pérdida lo
mejor que pudiese, así de los cueros como del vino, y principalmente del
menoscabo de la cola, de quien tanta cuenta hacían. Dorotea consoló a
Sancho Panza diciéndole que cada y cuando que pareciese haber sido verdad
que su amo hubiese descabezado al gigante, le prometía, en viéndose
pacífica en su reino, de darle el mejor condado que en él hubiese.
Consolóse con esto Sancho, y aseguró a la princesa que tuviese por cierto
que él había visto la cabeza del gigante, y que, por más señas, tenía una
barba que le llegaba a la cintura; y que si no parecía, era porque todo
cuanto en aquella casa pasaba era por vía de encantamento, como él lo había
probado otra vez que había posado en ella. Dorotea dijo que así lo creía, y
que no tuviese pena, que todo se haría bien y sucedería a pedir de boca.
Sosegados todos, el cura quiso acabar de leer la novela, porque vio que
faltaba poco. Cardenio, Dorotea y todos los demás le rogaron la acabase.
Él, que a todos quiso dar gusto, y por el que él tenía de leerla, prosiguió
el cuento, que así decía:
«Sucedió, pues, que, por la satisfación que Anselmo tenía de la bondad de
Camila, vivía una vida contenta y descuidada, y Camila, de industria, hacía
mal rostro a Lotario, porque Anselmo entendiese al revés de la voluntad que
le tenía; y, para más confirmación de su hecho, pidió licencia Lotario para
no venir a su casa, pues claramente se mostraba la pesadumbre que con su
vista Camila recebía; mas el engañado Anselmo le dijo que en ninguna manera
tal hiciese. Y, desta manera, por mil maneras era Anselmo el fabricador de
su deshonra, creyendo que lo era de su gusto.
»En esto, el que tenía Leonela de verse cualificada, no de con sus amores,
llegó a tanto que, sin mirar a otra cosa, se iba tras él a suelta rienda,
fiada en que su señora la encubría, y aun la advertía del modo que con poco
recelo pudiese ponerle en ejecución. En fin, una noche sintió Anselmo pasos
en el aposento de Leonela, y, queriendo entrar a ver quién los daba, sintió
que le detenían la puerta, cosa que le puso más voluntad de abrirla; y
tanta fuerza hizo, que la abrió, y entró dentro a tiempo que vio que un
hombre saltaba por la ventana a la calle; y, acudiendo con presteza a
alcanzarle o conocerle, no pudo conseguir lo uno ni lo otro, porque Leonela
se abrazó con él, diciéndole:
»—Sosiégate, señor mío, y no te alborotes, ni sigas al que de aquí saltó;
es cosa mía, y tanto, que es mi esposo.
»No lo quiso creer Anselmo; antes, ciego de enojo, sacó la daga y quiso
herir a Leonela, diciéndole que le dijese la verdad, si no, que la mataría.
Ella, con el miedo, sin saber lo que se decía, le dijo:
»—No me mates, señor, que yo te diré cosas de más importancia de las que
puedes imaginar.
»—Dilas luego —dijo Anselmo—; si no, muerta eres.
»—Por ahora será imposible —dijo Leonela—, según estoy de turbada; déjame
hasta mañana, que entonces sabrás de mí lo que te ha de admirar; y está
seguro que el que saltó por esta ventana es un mancebo desta ciudad, que me
ha dado la mano de ser mi esposo.
»Sosegóse con esto Anselmo y quiso aguardar el término que se le pedía,
porque no pensaba oír cosa que contra Camila fuese, por estar de su bondad
tan satisfecho y seguro; y así, se salió del aposento y dejó encerrada en
él a Leonela, diciéndole que de allí no saldría hasta que le dijese lo que
tenía que decirle.
»Fue luego a ver a Camila y a decirle, como le dijo, todo aquello que con
su doncella le había pasado, y la palabra que le había dado de decirle
grandes cosas y de importancia. Si se turbó Camila o no, no hay para qué
decirlo, porque fue tanto el temor que cobró, creyendo verdaderamente —y
era de creer— que Leonela había de decir a Anselmo todo lo que sabía de su
poca fe, que no tuvo ánimo para esperar si su sospecha salía falsa o no. Y
aquella mesma noche, cuando le pareció que Anselmo dormía, juntó las
mejores joyas que tenía y algunos dineros, y, sin ser de nadie sentida,
salió de casa y se fue a la de Lotario, a quien contó lo que pasaba, y le
pidió que la pusiese en cobro, o que se ausentasen los dos donde de Anselmo
pudiesen estar seguros. La confusión en que Camila puso a Lotario fue tal,
que no le sabía responder palabra, ni menos sabía resolverse en lo que
haría.
»En fin, acordó de llevar a Camila a un monesterio, en quien era priora una
su hermana. Consintió Camila en ello, y, con la presteza que el caso pedía,
la llevó Lotario y la dejó en el monesterio, y él, ansimesmo, se ausentó
luego de la ciudad, sin dar parte a nadie de su ausencia.
»Cuando amaneció, sin echar de ver Anselmo que Camila faltaba de su lado,
con el deseo que tenía de saber lo que Leonela quería decirle, se levantó y
fue adonde la había dejado encerrada. Abrió y entró en el aposento, pero no
halló en él a Leonela: sólo halló puestas unas sábanas añudadas a la
ventana, indicio y señal que por allí se había descolgado e ido. Volvió
luego muy triste a decírselo a Camila, y, no hallándola en la cama ni en
toda la casa, quedó asombrado.Preguntó a los criados de casa por ella, pero
nadie le supo dar razón de lo que pedía.
»Acertó acaso, andando a buscar a Camila, que vio sus cofres abiertos y que
dellos faltaban las más de sus joyas, y con esto acabó de caer en la cuenta
de su desgracia, y en que no era Leonela la causa de su desventura. Y, ansí
como estaba, sin acabarse de vestir, triste y pensativo, fue a dar cuenta
de su desdicha a su amigo Lotario. Mas, cuando no le halló, y sus criados
le dijeron que aquella noche había faltado de casa y había llevado consigo
todos los dineros que tenía, pensó perder el juicio. Y, para acabar de
concluir con todo, volviéndose a su casa, no halló en ella ninguno de
cuantos criados ni criadas tenía, sino la casa desierta y sola.
»No sabía qué pensar, qué decir, ni qué hacer, y poco a poco se le iba
volviendo el juicio. Contemplábase y mirábase en un instante sin mujer, sin
amigo y sin criados; desamparado, a su parecer, del cielo que le cubría, y
sobre todo sin honra, porque en la falta de Camila vio su perdición.
»Resolvióse, en fin, a cabo de una gran pieza, de irse a la aldea de su
amigo, donde había estado cuando dio lugar a que se maquinase toda aquella
desventura. Cerró las puertas de su casa, subió a caballo, y con desmayado
aliento se puso en camino; y, apenas hubo andado la mitad, cuando, acosado
de sus pensamientos, le fue forzoso apearse y arrendar su caballo a un
árbol, a cuyo tronco se dejó caer, dando tiernos y dolorosos suspiros, y
allí se estuvo hasta casi que anochecía; y aquella hora vio que venía un
hombre a caballo de la ciudad, y, después de haberle saludado, le preguntó
qué nuevas había en Florencia. El ciudadano respondió:
»—Las más estrañas que muchos días ha se han oído en ella; porque se dice
públicamente que Lotario, aquel grande amigo de Anselmo el rico, que vivía
a San Juan, se llevó esta noche a Camila, mujer de Anselmo, el cual tampoco
parece. Todo esto ha dicho una criada de Camila, que anoche la halló el
gobernador descolgándose con una sábana por las ventanas de la casa de
Anselmo. En efeto, no sé puntualmente cómo pasó el negocio; sólo sé que
toda la ciudad está admirada deste suceso, porque no se podía esperar tal
hecho de la mucha y familiar amistad de los dos, que dicen que era tanta,
que los llamaban los dos amigos.
»—¿Sábese, por ventura —dijo Anselmo—, el camino que llevan Lotario y
Camila?
»—Ni por pienso —dijo el ciudadano—, puesto que el gobernador ha usado de
mucha diligencia en buscarlos
»—A Dios vais, señor —dijo Anselmo.
»—Con Él quedéis —respondió el ciudadano, y fuese.
»Con tan desdichadas nuevas, casi casi llegó a términos Anselmo, no sólo de
perder el juicio, sino de acabar la vida. Levantóse como pudo y llegó a
casa de su amigo, que aún no sabía su desgracia; mas, como le vio llegar
amarillo, consumido y seco, entendió que de algún grave mal venía fatigado.
Pidió luego Anselmo que le acostasen, y que le diesen aderezo de escribir.
Hízose así, y dejáronle acostado y solo, porque él así lo quiso, y aun que
le cerrasen la puerta. Viéndose, pues, solo, comenzó a cargar tanto la
imaginación de su desventura, que claramente conoció que se le iba acabando
la vida; y así, ordenó de dejar noticia de la causa de su estraña muerte;
y, comenzando a escribir, antes que acabase de poner todo lo que quería, le
faltó el aliento y dejó la vida en las manos del dolor que le causó su
curiosidad impertinente.
»Viendo el señor de casa que era ya tarde y que Anselmo no llamaba, acordó
de entrar a saber si pasaba adelante su indisposición, y hallóle tendido
boca abajo, la mitad del cuerpo en la cama y la otra mitad sobre el bufete,
sobre el cual estaba con el papel escrito y abierto, y él tenía aún la
pluma en la mano. Llegóse el huésped a él, habiéndole llamado primero; y,
trabándole por la mano, viendo que no le respondía y hallándole frío, vio
que estaba muerto. Admiróse y congojóse en gran manera, y llamó a la gente
de casa para que viesen la desgracia a Anselmo sucedida; y, finalmente,
leyó el papel, que conoció que de su mesma mano estaba escrito, el cual
contenía estas razones:
Un necio e impertinente deseo me quitó la vida. Si las nuevas de mi muerte
llegaren a los oídos de Camila, sepa que yo la perdono, porque no estaba
ella obligada a hacer milagros, ni yo tenía necesidad de querer que ella
los hiciese; y, pues yo fui el fabricador de mi deshonra, no hay para
qué...
»Hasta aquí escribió Anselmo, por donde se echó de ver que en aquel punto,
sin poder acabar la razón, se le acabó la vida. Otro día dio aviso su amigo
a los parientes de Anselmo de su muerte, los cuales ya sabían su desgracia,
y el monesterio donde Camila estaba, casi en el término de acompañar a su
esposo en aquel forzoso viaje, no por las nuevas del muerto esposo, mas por
las que supo del ausente amigo. Dícese que, aunque se vio viuda, no quiso
salir del monesterio, ni, menos, hacer profesión de monja, hasta que, no de
allí a muchos días, le vinieron nuevas que Lotario había muerto en una
batalla que en aquel tiempo dio monsiur de Lautrec al Gran Capitán Gonzalo
Fernández de Córdoba en el reino de Nápoles, donde había ido a parar el
tarde arrepentido amigo; lo cual sabido por Camila, hizo profesión, y acabó
en breves días la vida a las rigurosas manos de tristezas y melancolías.
Éste fue el fin que tuvieron todos, nacido de un tan desatinado principio.»
— Bien —dijo el cura— me parece esta novela, pero no me puedo persuadir que
esto sea verdad; y si es fingido, fingió mal el autor, porque no se puede
imaginar que haya marido tan necio que quiera hacer tan costosa experiencia
como Anselmo. Si este caso se pusiera entre un galán y una dama, pudiérase
llevar, pero entre marido y mujer, algo tiene del imposible; y, en lo que
toca al modo de contarle, no me descontenta.
Capítulo XXXVI. Que trata de la brava y descomunal batalla que don Quijote
tuvo con unos cueros de vino tinto, con otros raros sucesos que en la venta
le sucedieron
Estando en esto, el ventero, que estaba a la puerta de la venta, dijo:
— Esta que viene es una hermosa tropa de huéspedes: si ellos paran aquí,
gaudeamus tenemos.
— ¿Qué gente es? —dijo Cardenio.
— Cuatro hombres —respondió el ventero— vienen a caballo, a la jineta, con
lanzas y adargas, y todos con antifaces negros; y junto con ellos viene una
mujer vestida de blanco, en un sillón, ansimesmo cubierto el rostro, y
otros dos mozos de a pie.
— ¿Vienen muy cerca? —preguntó el cura.
— Tan cerca —respondió el ventero—, que ya llegan.
Oyendo esto Dorotea, se cubrió el rostro, y Cardenio se entró en el
aposento de don Quijote; y casi no habían tenido lugar para esto, cuando
entraron en la venta todos los que el ventero había dicho; y, apeándose los
cuatro de a caballo, que de muy gentil talle y disposición eran, fueron a
apear a la mujer que en el sillón venía; y, tomándola uno dellos en sus
brazos, la sentó en una silla que estaba a la entrada del aposento donde
Cardenio se había escondido. En todo este tiempo, ni ella ni ellos se
habían quitado los antifaces, ni hablado palabra alguna; sólo que, al
sentarse la mujer en la silla, dio un profundo suspiro y dejó caer los
brazos, como persona enferma y desmayada. Los mozos de a pie llevaron los
caballos a la caballeriza.
Viendo esto el cura, deseoso de saber qué gente era aquella que con tal
traje y tal silencio estaba, se fue donde estaban los mozos, y a uno dellos
le preguntó lo que ya deseaba; el cual le respondió:
— Pardiez, señor, yo no sabré deciros qué gente sea ésta; sólo sé que
muestra ser muy principal, especialmente aquel que llegó a tomar en sus
brazos a aquella señora que habéis visto; y esto dígolo porque todos los
demás le tienen respeto, y no se hace otra cosa más de la que él ordena y
manda.
— Y la señora, ¿quién es? —preguntó el cura.
— Tampoco sabré decir eso —respondió el mozo—, porque en todo el camino no
la he visto el rostro; suspirar sí la he oído muchas veces, y dar unos
gemidos que parece que con cada uno dellos quiere dar el alma. Y no es de
maravillar que no sepamos más de lo que habemos dicho, porque mi compañero
y yo no ha más de dos días que los acompañamos; porque, habiéndolos
encontrado en el camino, nos rogaron y persuadieron que viniésemos con
ellos hasta el Andalucía, ofreciéndose a pagárnoslo muy bien.
— ¿Y habéis oído nombrar a alguno dellos? —preguntó el cura.
— No, por cierto —respondió el mozo—, porque todos caminan con tanto
silencio que es maravilla, porque no se oye entre ellos otra cosa que los
suspiros y sollozos de la pobre señora, que nos mueven a lástima; y sin
duda tenemos creído que ella va forzada dondequiera que va, y, según se
puede colegir por su hábito, ella es monja, o va a serlo, que es lo más
cierto, y quizá porque no le debe de nacer de voluntad el monjío, va
triste, como parece.
— Todo podría ser —dijo el cura.
Y, dejándolos, se volvió adonde estaba Dorotea, la cual, como había oído
suspirar a la embozada, movida de natural compasión, se llegó a ella y le
dijo:
— ¿Qué mal sentís, señora mía? Mirad si es alguno de quien las mujeres
suelen tener uso y experiencia de curarle, que de mi parte os ofrezco una
buena voluntad de serviros.
A todo esto callaba la lastimada señora; y, aunque Dorotea tornó con
mayores ofrecimientos, todavía se estaba en su silencio, hasta que llegó el
caballero embozado que dijo el mozo que los demás obedecían, y dijo a
Dorotea:
— No os canséis, señora, en ofrecer nada a esa mujer, porque tiene por
costumbre de no agradecer cosa que por ella se hace, ni procuréis que os
responda, si no queréis oír alguna mentira de su boca.
— Jamás la dije —dijo a esta sazón la que hasta allí había estado callando—;
antes, por ser tan verdadera y tan sin trazas mentirosas, me veo ahora en
tanta desventura; y desto vos mesmo quiero que seáis el testigo, pues mi
pura verdad os hace a vos ser falso y mentiroso.
Oyó estas razones Cardenio bien clara y distintamente, como quien estaba
tan junto de quien las decía que sola la puerta del aposento de don Quijote
estaba en medio; y, así como las oyó, dando una gran voz dijo:
— ¡Válgame Dios! ¿Qué es esto que oigo? ¿Qué voz es esta que ha llegado a
mis oídos?
Volvió la cabeza a estos gritos aquella señora, toda sobresaltada, y, no
viendo quién las daba, se levantó en pie y fuese a entrar en el aposento;
lo cual visto por el caballero, la detuvo, sin dejarla mover un paso. A
ella, con la turbación y desasosiego, se le cayó el tafetán con que traía
cubierto el rostro, y descubrió una hermosura incomparable y un rostro
milagroso, aunque descolorido y asombrado, porque con los ojos andaba
rodeando todos los lugares donde alcanzaba con la vista, con tanto ahínco,
que parecía persona fuera de juicio; cuyas señales, sin saber por qué las
hacía, pusieron gran lástima en Dorotea y en cuantos la miraban. Teníala el
caballero fuertemente asida por las espaldas, y, por estar tan ocupado en
tenerla, no pudo acudir a alzarse el embozo, que se le caía, como, en
efeto, se le cayó del todo; y, alzando los ojos Dorotea, que abrazada con
la señora estaba, vio que el que abrazada ansimesmo la tenía era su esposo
don Fernando; y, apenas le hubo conocido, cuando, arrojando de lo íntimo de
sus entrañas un luengo y tristísimo ''¡ay!'', se dejó caer de espaldas
desmayada; y, a no hallarse allí junto el barbero, que la recogió en los
brazos, ella diera consigo en el suelo.
Acudió luego el cura a quitarle el embozo, para echarle agua en el rostro,
y así como la descubrió la conoció don Fernando, que era el que estaba
abrazado con la otra, y quedó como muerto en verla; pero no porque dejase,
con todo esto, de tener a Luscinda, que era la que procuraba soltarse de
sus brazos; la cual había conocido en el suspiro a Cardenio, y él la había
conocido a ella. Oyó asimesmo Cardenio el ¡ay! que dio Dorotea cuando se
cayó desmayada, y, creyendo que era su Luscinda, salió del aposento
despavorido, y lo primero que vio fue a don Fernando, que tenía abrazada a
Luscinda. También don Fernando conoció luego a Cardenio; y todos tres,
Luscinda, Cardenio y Dorotea, quedaron mudos y suspensos, casi sin saber lo
que les había acontecido.
Callaban todos y mirábanse todos: Dorotea a don Fernando, don Fernando a
Cardenio, Cardenio a Luscinda y Luscinda a Cardenio. Mas quien primero
rompió el silencio fue Luscinda, hablando a don Fernando desta manera:
— Dejadme, señor don Fernando, por lo que debéis a ser quien sois, ya que
por otro respeto no lo hagáis; dejadme llegar al muro de quien yo soy
yedra, al arrimo de quien no me han podido apartar vuestras
importunaciones, vuestras amenazas, vuestras promesas ni vuestras dádivas.
Notad cómo el cielo, por desusados y a nosotros encubiertos caminos, me ha
puesto a mi verdadero esposo delante. Y bien sabéis por mil costosas
experiencias que sola la muerte fuera bastante para borrarle de mi memoria.
Sean, pues, parte tan claros desengaños para que volváis, ya que no podáis
hacer otra cosa, el amor en rabia, la voluntad en despecho, y acabadme con
él la vida; que, como yo la rinda delante de mi buen esposo, la daré por
bien empleada: quizá con mi muerte quedará satisfecho de la fe que le
mantuve hasta el último trance de la vida.
Había en este entretanto vuelto Dorotea en sí, y había estado escuchando
todas las razones que Luscinda dijo, por las cuales vino en conocimiento de
quién ella era; que, viendo que don Fernando aún no la dejaba de los
brazos, ni respondía a sus razones, esforzándose lo más que pudo, se
levantó y se fue a hincar de rodillas a sus pies; y, derramando mucha
cantidad de hermosas y lastimeras lágrimas, así le comenzó a decir:
— Si ya no es, señor mío, que los rayos deste sol que en tus brazos
eclipsado tienes te quitan y ofuscan los de tus ojos, ya habrás echado de
ver que la que a tus pies está arrodillada es la sin ventura, hasta que tú
quieras, y la desdichada Dorotea. Yo soy aquella labradora humilde a quien
tú, por tu bondad o por tu gusto, quisiste levantar a la alteza de poder
llamarse tuya. Soy la que, encerrada en los límites de la honestidad, vivió
vida contenta hasta que, a las voces de tus importunidades, y, al parecer,
justos y amorosos sentimientos, abrió las puertas de su recato y te entregó
las llaves de su libertad: dádiva de ti tan mal agradecida, cual lo muestra
bien claro haber sido forzoso hallarme en el lugar donde me hallas, y verte
yo a ti de la manera que te veo. Pero, con todo esto, no querría que cayese
en tu imaginación pensar que he venido aquí con pasos de mi deshonra,
habiéndome traído sólo los del dolor y sentimiento de verme de ti olvidada.
Tú quisiste que yo fuese tuya, y quisístelo de manera que, aunque ahora
quieras que no lo sea, no será posible que tú dejes de ser mío. Mira, señor
mío, que puede ser recompensa a la hermosura y nobleza por quien me dejas
la incomparable voluntad que te tengo. Tú no puedes ser de la hermosa
Luscinda, porque eres mío, ni ella puede ser tuya, porque es de Cardenio; y
más fácil te será, si en ello miras, reducir tu voluntad a querer a quien
te adora, que no encaminar la que te aborrece a que bien te quiera. Tú
solicitaste mi descuido, tú rogaste a mi entereza, tú no ignoraste mi
calidad, tú sabes bien de la manera que me entregué a toda tu voluntad: no
te queda lugar ni acogida de llamarte a engaño. Y si esto es así, como lo
es, y tú eres tan cristiano como caballero, ¿por qué por tantos rodeos
dilatas de hacerme venturosa en los fines, como me heciste en los
principios? Y si no me quieres por la que soy, que soy tu verdadera y
legítima esposa, quiéreme, a lo menos, y admíteme por tu esclava; que, como
yo esté en tu poder, me tendré por dichosa y bien afortunada. No permitas,
con dejarme y desampararme, que se hagan y junten corrillos en mi deshonra;
no des tan mala vejez a mis padres, pues no lo merecen los leales servicios
que, como buenos vasallos, a los tuyos siempre han hecho. Y si te parece
que has de aniquilar tu sangre por mezclarla con la mía, considera que
pocas o ninguna nobleza hay en el mundo que no haya corrido por este
camino, y que la que se toma de las mujeres no es la que hace al caso en
las ilustres decendencias; cuanto más, que la verdadera nobleza consiste en
la virtud, y si ésta a ti te falta, negándome lo que tan justamente me
debes, yo quedaré con más ventajas de noble que las que tú tienes. En fin,
señor, lo que últimamente te digo es que, quieras o no quieras, yo soy tu
esposa: testigos son tus palabras, que no han ni deben ser mentirosas, si
ya es que te precias de aquello por que me desprecias; testigo será la
firma que hiciste, y testigo el cielo, a quien tú llamaste por testigo de
lo que me prometías. Y, cuando todo esto falte, tu misma conciencia no ha
de faltar de dar voces callando en mitad de tus alegrías, volviendo por
esta verdad que te he dicho y turbando tus mejores gustos y contentos.
Estas y otras razones dijo la lastimada Dorotea, con tanto sentimiento y
lágrimas, que los mismos que acompañaban a don Fernando, y cuantos
presentes estaban, la acompañaron en ellas. Escuchóla don Fernando sin
replicalle palabra, hasta que ella dio fin a las suyas y principio a tantos
sollozos y suspiros, que bien había de ser corazón de bronce el que con
muestras de tanto dolor no se enterneciera. Mirándola estaba Luscinda, no
menos lastimada de su sentimiento que admirada de su mucha discreción y
hermosura; y, aunque quisiera llegarse a ella y decirle algunas palabras de
consuelo, no la dejaban los brazos de don Fernando, que apretada la tenían.
El cual, lleno de confusión y espanto, al cabo de un buen espacio que
atentamente estuvo mirando a Dorotea, abrió los brazos y, dejando libre a
Luscinda, dijo:
— Venciste, hermosa Dorotea, venciste; porque no es posible tener ánimo para
negar tantas verdades juntas.
Con el desmayo que Luscinda había tenido, así como la dejó don Fernando,
iba a caer en el suelo; mas, hallándose Cardenio allí junto, que a las
espaldas de don Fernando se había puesto porque no le conociese,
prosupuesto todo temor y aventurando a todo riesgo, acudió a sostener a
Luscinda, y, cogiéndola entre sus brazos, le dijo:
— Si el piadoso cielo gusta y quiere que ya tengas algún descanso, leal,
firme y hermosa señora mía, en ninguna parte creo yo que le tendrás más
seguro que en estos brazos que ahora te reciben, y otro tiempo te
recibieron, cuando la fortuna quiso que pudiese llamarte mía.
A estas razones, puso Luscinda en Cardenio los ojos, y, habiendo comenzado
a conocerle, primero por la voz, y asegurándose que él era con la vista,
casi fuera de sentido y sin tener cuenta a ningún honesto respeto, le echó
los brazos al cuello, y, juntando su rostro con el de Cardenio, le dijo:
— Vos sí, señor mío, sois el verdadero dueño desta vuestra captiva, aunque
más lo impida la contraria suerte, y, aunque más amenazas le hagan a esta
vida que en la vuestra se sustenta.
Estraño espectáculo fue éste para don Fernando y para todos los
circunstantes, admirándose de tan no visto suceso. Parecióle a Dorotea que
don Fernando había perdido la color del rostro y que hacía ademán de querer
vengarse de Cardenio, porque le vio encaminar la mano a ponella en la
espada; y, así como lo pensó, con no vista presteza se abrazó con él por
las rodillas, besándoselas y teniéndole apretado, que no le dejaba mover,
y, sin cesar un punto de sus lágrimas, le decía:
— ¿Qué es lo que piensas hacer, único refugio mío, en este tan impensado
trance? Tú tienes a tus pies a tu esposa, y la que quieres que lo sea está
en los brazos de su marido. Mira si te estará bien o te será posible
deshacer lo que el cielo ha hecho, o si te convendrá querer levantar a
igualar a ti mismo a la que, pospuesto todo inconveniente, confirmada en su
verdad y firmeza, delante de tus ojos tiene los suyos, bañados de licor
amoroso el rostro y pecho de su verdadero esposo. Por quien Dios es te
ruego, y por quien tú eres te suplico, que este tan notorio desengaño no
sólo no acreciente tu ira, sino que la mengüe en tal manera, que con
quietud y sosiego permitas que estos dos amantes le tengan, sin
impedimiento tuyo, todo el tiempo que el cielo quisiere concedérsele; y en
esto mostrarás la generosidad de tu ilustre y noble pecho, y verá el mundo
que tiene contigo más fuerza la razón que el apetito.
En tanto que esto decía Dorotea, aunque Cardenio tenía abrazada a Luscinda,
no quitaba los ojos de don Fernando, con determinación de que, si le viese
hacer algún movimiento en su perjuicio, procurar defenderse y ofender como
mejor pudiese a todos aquellos que en su daño se mostrasen, aunque le
costase la vida. Pero a esta sazón acudieron los amigos de don Fernando, y
el cura y el barbero, que a todo habían estado presentes, sin que faltase
el bueno de Sancho Panza, y todos rodeaban a don Fernando, suplicándole
tuviese por bien de mirar las lágrimas de Dorotea; y que, siendo verdad,
como sin duda ellos creían que lo era, lo que en sus razones había dicho,
que no permitiese quedase defraudada de sus tan justas esperanzas. Que
considerase que, no acaso, como parecía, sino con particular providencia
del cielo, se habían todos juntado en lugar donde menos ninguno pensaba; y
que advirtiese —dijo el cura— que sola la muerte podía apartar a Luscinda
de Cardenio; y, aunque los dividiesen filos de alguna espada, ellos
tendrían por felicísima su muerte; y que en los lazos inremediables era
suma cordura, forzándose y venciéndose a sí mismo, mostrar un generoso
pecho, permitiendo que por sola su voluntad los dos gozasen el bien que el
cielo ya les había concedido; que pusiese los ojos ansimesmo en la beldad
de Dorotea, y vería que pocas o ninguna se le podían igualar, cuanto más
hacerle ventaja, y que juntase a su hermosura su humildad y el estremo del
amor que le tenía; y, sobre todo, advirtiese que si se preciaba de
caballero y de cristiano, que no podía hacer otra cosa que cumplille la
palabra dada, y que, cumpliéndosela, cumpliría con Dios y satisfaría a las
gentes discretas, las cuales saben y conocen que es prerrogativa de la
hermosura, aunque esté en sujeto humilde, como se acompañe con la
honestidad, poder levantarse e igualarse a cualquiera alteza, sin nota de
menoscabo del que la levanta e iguala a sí mismo; y, cuando se cumplen las
fuertes leyes del gusto, como en ello no intervenga pecado, no debe de ser
culpado el que las sigue.
En efeto, a estas razones añadieron todos otras, tales y tantas, que el
valeroso pecho de don Fernando (en fin, como alimentado con ilustre sangre)
se ablandó y se dejó vencer de la verdad, que él no pudiera negar aunque
quisiera; y la señal que dio de haberse rendido y entregado al buen parecer
que se le había propuesto fue abajarse y abrazar a Dorotea, diciéndole:
— Levantaos, señora mía, que no es justo que esté arrodillada a mis pies la
que yo tengo en mi alma; y si hasta aquí no he dado muestras de lo que
digo, quizá ha sido por orden del cielo, para que, viendo yo en vos la fe
con que me amáis, os sepa estimar en lo que merecéis. Lo que os ruego es
que no me reprehendáis mi mal término y mi mucho descuido, pues la misma
ocasión y fuerza que me movió para acetaros por mía, esa misma me impelió
para procurar no ser vuestro. Y que esto sea verdad, volved y mirad los
ojos de la ya contenta Luscinda, y en ellos hallaréis disculpa de todos mis
yerros; y, pues ella halló y alcanzó lo que deseaba, y yo he hallado en vos
lo que me cumple, viva ella segura y contenta luengos y felices años con su
Cardenio, que yo rogaré al cielo que me los deje vivir con mi Dorotea.
Y, diciendo esto, la tornó a abrazar y a juntar su rostro con el suyo, con
tan tierno sentimiento, que le fue necesario tener gran cuenta con que las
lágrimas no acabasen de dar indubitables señas de su amor y
arrepentimiento. No lo hicieron así las de Luscinda y Cardenio, y aun las
de casi todos los que allí presentes estaban, porque comenzaron a derramar
tantas, los unos de contento proprio y los otros del ajeno, que no parecía
sino que algún grave y mal caso a todos había sucedido. Hasta Sancho Panza
lloraba, aunque después dijo que no lloraba él sino por ver que Dorotea no
era, como él pensaba, la reina Micomicona, de quien él tantas mercedes
esperaba. Duró algún espacio, junto con el llanto, la admiración en todos,
y luego Cardenio y Luscinda se fueron a poner de rodillas ante don
Fernando, dándole gracias de la merced que les había hecho con tan corteses
razones, que don Fernando no sabía qué responderles; y así, los levantó y
abrazó con muestras de mucho amor y de mucha cortesía.
Preguntó luego a Dorotea le dijese cómo había venido a aquel lugar tan
lejos del suyo. Ella, con breves y discretas razones, contó todo lo que
antes había contado a Cardenio, de lo cual gustó tanto don Fernando y los
que con él venían, que quisieran que durara el cuento más tiempo: tanta era
la gracia con que Dorotea contaba sus desventuras. Y, así como hubo
acabado, dijo don Fernando lo que en la ciudad le había acontecido después
que halló el papel en el seno de Luscinda, donde declaraba ser esposa de
Cardenio y no poderlo ser suya. Dijo que la quiso matar, y lo hiciera si de
sus padres no fuera impedido; y que así, se salió de su casa, despechado y
corrido, con determinación de vengarse con más comodidad; y que otro día
supo como Luscinda había faltado de casa de sus padres, sin que nadie
supiese decir dónde se había ido, y que, en resolución, al cabo de algunos
meses vino a saber como estaba en un monesterio, con voluntad de quedarse
en él toda la vida, si no la pudiese pasar con Cardenio; y que, así como lo
supo, escogiendo para su compañía aquellos tres caballeros, vino al lugar
donde estaba, a la cual no había querido hablar, temeroso que, en sabiendo
que él estaba allí, había de haber más guarda en el monesterio; y así,
aguardando un día a que la portería estuviese abierta, dejó a los dos a la
guarda de la puerta, y él, con otro, habían entrado en el monesterio
buscando a Luscinda, la cual hallaron en el claustro hablando con una
monja; y, arrebatándola, sin darle lugar a otra cosa, se habían venido con
ella a un lugar donde se acomodaron de aquello que hubieron menester para
traella. Todo lo cual habían podido hacer bien a su salvo, por estar el
monesterio en el campo, buen trecho fuera del pueblo. Dijo que, así como
Luscinda se vio en su poder, perdió todos los sentidos; y que, después de
vuelta en sí, no había hecho otra cosa sino llorar y suspirar, sin hablar
palabra alguna; y que así, acompañados de silencio y de lágrimas, habían
llegado a aquella venta, que para él era haber llegado al cielo, donde se
rematan y tienen fin todas las desventuras de la tierra.
Capítulo XXXVII. Que prosigue la historia de la famosa infanta Micomicona,
con otras graciosas aventuras
Todo esto escuchaba Sancho, no con poco dolor de su ánima, viendo que se
le desparecían e iban en humo las esperanzas de su ditado, y que la linda
princesa Micomicona se le había vuelto en Dorotea, y el gigante en don
Fernando, y su amo se estaba durmiendo a sueño suelto, bien descuidado de
todo lo sucedido. No se podía asegurar Dorotea si era soñado el bien que
poseía. Cardenio estaba en el mismo pensamiento, y el de Luscinda corría
por la misma cuenta. Don Fernando daba gracias al cielo por la merced
recebida y haberle sacado de aquel intricado laberinto, donde se hallaba
tan a pique de perder el crédito y el alma; y, finalmente, cuantos en la
venta estaban, estaban contentos y gozosos del buen suceso que habían
tenido tan trabados y desesperados negocios.
Todo lo ponía en su punto el cura, como discreto, y a cada uno daba el
parabién del bien alcanzado; pero quien más jubilaba y se contentaba era la
ventera, por la promesa que Cardenio y el cura le habían hecho de pagalle
todos los daños e intereses que por cuenta de don Quijote le hubiesen
venido. Sólo Sancho, como ya se ha dicho, era el afligido, el desventurado
y el triste; y así, con malencónico semblante, entró a su amo, el cual
acababa de despertar, a quien dijo:
— Bien puede vuestra merced, señor Triste Figura, dormir todo lo que
quisiere, sin cuidado de matar a ningún gigante, ni de volver a la princesa
su reino: que ya todo está hecho y concluido.
— Eso creo yo bien —respondió don Quijote—, porque he tenido con el gigante
la más descomunal y desaforada batalla que pienso tener en todos los días
de mi vida; y de un revés, ¡zas!, le derribé la cabeza en el suelo, y fue
tanta la sangre que le salió, que los arroyos corrían por la tierra como si
fueran de agua.
— Como si fueran de vino tinto, pudiera vuestra merced decir mejor
— respondió Sancho—, porque quiero que sepa vuestra merced, si es que no lo
sabe, que el gigante muerto es un cuero horadado, y la sangre, seis arrobas
de vino tinto que encerraba en su vientre; y la cabeza cortada es la puta
que me parió, y llévelo todo Satanás.
— Y ¿qué es lo que dices, loco? —replicó don Quijote—. ¿Estás en tu seso?
— Levántese vuestra merced —dijo Sancho—, y verá el buen recado que ha
hecho, y lo que tenemos que pagar; y verá a la reina convertida en una dama
particular, llamada Dorotea, con otros sucesos que, si cae en ellos, le han
de admirar.
— No me maravillaría de nada deso —replicó don Quijote—, porque, si bien te
acuerdas, la otra vez que aquí estuvimos te dije yo que todo cuanto aquí
sucedía eran cosas de encantamento, y no sería mucho que ahora fuese lo
mesmo.
— Todo lo creyera yo —respondió Sancho—, si también mi manteamiento fuera
cosa dese jaez, mas no lo fue, sino real y verdaderamente; y vi yo que el
ventero que aquí está hoy día tenía del un cabo de la manta, y me empujaba
hacia el cielo con mucho donaire y brío, y con tanta risa como fuerza; y
donde interviene conocerse las personas, tengo para mí, aunque simple y
pecador, que no hay encantamento alguno, sino mucho molimiento y mucha mala
ventura.
— Ahora bien, Dios lo remediará —dijo don Quijote—. Dame de vestir y déjame
salir allá fuera, que quiero ver los sucesos y transformaciones que dices.
Diole de vestir Sancho, y, en el entretanto que se vestía, contó el cura a
don Fernando y a los demás las locuras de don Quijote, y del artificio que
habían usado para sacarle de la Peña Pobre, donde él se imaginaba estar por
desdenes de su señora. Contóles asimismo casi todas las aventuras que
Sancho había contado, de que no poco se admiraron y rieron, por parecerles
lo que a todos parecía: ser el más estraño género de locura que podía caber
en pensamiento desparatado. Dijo más el cura: que, pues ya el buen suceso
de la señora Dorotea impidía pasar con su disignio adelante, que era
menester inventar y hallar otro para poderle llevar a su tierra. Ofrecióse
Cardenio de proseguir lo comenzado, y que Luscinda haría y representaría la
persona de Dorotea.
— No —dijo don Fernando—, no ha de ser así: que yo quiero que Dorotea
prosiga su invención; que, como no sea muy lejos de aquí el lugar deste
buen caballero, yo holgaré de que se procure su remedio.
— No está más de dos jornadas de aquí.
— Pues, aunque estuviera más, gustara yo de caminallas, a trueco de hacer
tan buena obra.
Salió, en esto, don Quijote, armado de todos sus pertrechos, con el yelmo,
aunque abollado, de Mambrino en la cabeza, embrazado de su rodela y
arrimado a su tronco o lanzón. Suspendió a don Fernando y a los demás la
estraña presencia de don Quijote, viendo su rostro de media legua de
andadura, seco y amarillo, la desigualdad de sus armas y su mesurado
continente, y estuvieron callando hasta ver lo que él decía, el cual, con
mucha gravedad y reposo, puestos los ojos en la hermosa Dorotea, dijo:
— Estoy informado, hermosa señora, deste mi escudero que la vuestra grandeza
se ha aniquilado, y vuestro ser se ha deshecho, porque de reina y gran
señora que solíades ser os habéis vuelto en una particular doncella. Si
esto ha sido por orden del rey nigromante de vuestro padre, temeroso que yo
no os diese la necesaria y debida ayuda, digo que no supo ni sabe de la
misa la media, y que fue poco versado en las historias caballerescas,
porque si él las hubiera leído y pasado tan atentamente y con tanto espacio
como yo las pasé y leí, hallara a cada paso cómo otros caballeros de menor
fama que la mía habían acabado cosas más dificultosas, no siéndolo mucho
matar a un gigantillo, por arrogante que sea; porque no ha muchas horas que
yo me vi con él, y... quiero callar, porque no me digan que miento; pero el
tiempo, descubridor de todas las cosas, lo dirá cuando menos lo pensemos.
— Vístesos vos con dos cueros, que no con un gigante —dijo a esta sazón el
ventero.
Al cual mandó don Fernando que callase y no interrumpiese la plática de don
Quijote en ninguna manera; y don Quijote prosiguió diciendo:
— Digo, en fin, alta y desheredada señora, que si por la causa que he dicho
vuestro padre ha hecho este metamorfóseos en vuestra persona, que no le
deis crédito alguno, porque no hay ningún peligro en la tierra por quien no
se abra camino mi espada, con la cual, poniendo la cabeza de vuestro
enemigo en tierra, os pondré a vos la corona de la vuestra en la cabeza en
breves días.
No dijo más don Quijote, y esperó a que la princesa le respondiese, la
cual, como ya sabía la determinación de don Fernando de que se prosiguiese
adelante en el engaño hasta llevar a su tierra a don Quijote, con mucho
donaire y gravedad, le respondió:
— Quienquiera que os dijo, valeroso caballero de la Triste Figura, que yo me
había mudado y trocado de mi ser, no os dijo lo cierto, porque la misma que
ayer fui me soy hoy. Verdad es que alguna mudanza han hecho en mí ciertos
acaecimientos de buena ventura, que me la han dado la mejor que yo pudiera
desearme, pero no por eso he dejado de ser la que antes y de tener los
mesmos pensamientos de valerme del valor de vuestro valeroso e invenerable
brazo que siempre he tenido. Así que, señor mío, vuestra bondad vuelva la
honra al padre que me engendró, y téngale por hombre advertido y prudente,
pues con su ciencia halló camino tan fácil y tan verdadero para remediar mi
desgracia; que yo creo que si por vos, señor, no fuera, jamás acertara a
tener la ventura que tengo; y en esto digo tanta verdad como son buenos
testigos della los más destos señores que están presentes. Lo que resta es
que mañana nos pongamos en camino, porque ya hoy se podrá hacer poca
jornada, y en lo demás del buen suceso que espero, lo dejaré a Dios y al
valor de vuestro pecho.
Esto dijo la discreta Dorotea, y, en oyéndolo don Quijote, se volvió a
Sancho, y, con muestras de mucho enojo, le dijo:
— Ahora te digo, Sanchuelo, que eres el mayor bellacuelo que hay en España.
Dime, ladrón vagamundo, ¿no me acabaste de decir ahora que esta princesa se
había vuelto en una doncella que se llamaba Dorotea, y que la cabeza que
entiendo que corté a un gigante era la puta que te parió, con otros
disparates que me pusieron en la mayor confusión que jamás he estado en
todos los días de mi vida? ¡Voto... —y miró al cielo y apretó los dientes—
que estoy por hacer un estrago en ti, que ponga sal en la mollera a todos
cuantos mentirosos escuderos hubiere de caballeros andantes, de aquí
adelante, en el mundo!
— Vuestra merced se sosiegue, señor mío —respondió Sancho—, que bien podría
ser que yo me hubiese engañado en lo que toca a la mutación de la señora
princesa Micomicona; pero, en lo que toca a la cabeza del gigante, o, a lo
menos, a la horadación de los cueros y a lo de ser vino tinto la sangre, no
me engaño, ¡vive Dios!, porque los cueros allí están heridos, a la cabecera
del lecho de vuestra merced, y el vino tinto tiene hecho un lago el
aposento; y si no, al freír de los huevos lo verá; quiero decir que lo verá
cuando aquí su merced del señor ventero le pida el menoscabo de todo. De lo
demás, de que la señora reina se esté como se estaba, me regocijo en el
alma, porque me va mi parte, como a cada hijo de vecino.
— Ahora yo te digo, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que eres un mentecato; y
perdóname, y basta.
— Basta —dijo don Fernando—, y no se hable más en esto; y, pues la señora
princesa dice que se camine mañana, porque ya hoy es tarde, hágase así, y
esta noche la podremos pasar en buena conversación hasta el venidero día,
donde todos acompañaremos al señor don Quijote, porque queremos ser
testigos de las valerosas e inauditas hazañas que ha de hacer en el
discurso desta grande empresa que a su cargo lleva.
— Yo soy el que tengo de serviros y acompañaros —respondió don Quijote—, y
agradezco mucho la merced que se me hace y la buena opinión que de mí se
tiene, la cual procuraré que salga verdadera, o me costará la vida, y aun
más, si más costarme puede.
Muchas palabras de comedimiento y muchos ofrecimientos pasaron entre don
Quijote y don Fernando; pero a todo puso silencio un pasajero que en
aquella sazón entró en la venta, el cual en su traje mostraba ser cristiano
recién venido de tierra de moros, porque venía vestido con una casaca de
paño azul, corta de faldas, con medias mangas y sin cuello; los calzones
eran asimismo de lienzo azul, con bonete de la misma color; traía unos
borceguíes datilados y un alfanje morisco, puesto en un tahelí que le
atravesaba el pecho. Entró luego tras él, encima de un jumento, una mujer a
la morisca vestida, cubierto el rostro con una toca en la cabeza; traía un
bonetillo de brocado, y vestida una almalafa, que desde los hombros a los
pies la cubría. Era el hombre de robusto y agraciado talle, de edad de poco
más de cuarenta años, algo moreno de rostro, largo de bigotes y la barba
muy bien puesta. En resolución, él mostraba en su apostura que si estuviera
bien vestido, le juzgaran por persona de calidad y bien nacida.
Pidió, en entrando, un aposento, y, como le dijeron que en la venta no le
había, mostró recebir pesadumbre; y, llegándose a la que en el traje
parecía mora, la apeó en sus brazos. Luscinda, Dorotea, la ventera, su hija
y Maritornes, llevadas del nuevo y para ellas nunca visto traje, rodearon a
la mora, y Dorotea, que siempre fue agraciada, comedida y discreta,
pareciéndole que así ella como el que la traía se congojaban por la falta
del aposento, le dijo:
— No os dé mucha pena, señora mía, la incomodidad de regalo que aquí falta,
pues es proprio de ventas no hallarse en ellas; pero, con todo esto, si
gustáredes de pasar con nosotras —señalando a Luscinda—, quizá en el
discurso de este camino habréis hallado otros no tan buenos acogimientos.
No respondió nada a esto la embozada, ni hizo otra cosa que levantarse de
donde sentado se había, y, puestas entrambas manos cruzadas sobre el pecho,
inclinada la cabeza, dobló el cuerpo en señal de que lo agradecía. Por su
silencio imaginaron que, sin duda alguna, debía de ser mora, y que no sabía
hablar cristiano. Llegó, en esto, el cautivo, que entendiendo en otra cosa
hasta entonces había estado, y, viendo que todas tenían cercada a la que
con él venía, y que ella a cuanto le decían callaba, dijo:
— Señoras mías, esta doncella apenas entiende mi lengua, ni sabe hablar otra
ninguna sino conforme a su tierra, y por esto no debe de haber respondido,
ni responde, a lo que se le ha preguntado.
— No se le pregunta otra cosa ninguna —respondió Luscinda— sino ofrecelle
por esta noche nuestra compañía y parte del lugar donde nos acomodáremos,
donde se le hará el regalo que la comodidad ofreciere, con la voluntad que
obliga a servir a todos los estranjeros que dello tuvieren necesidad,
especialmente siendo mujer a quien se sirve.
— Por ella y por mí —respondió el captivo— os beso, señora mía, las manos, y
estimo mucho y en lo que es razón la merced ofrecida; que en tal ocasión, y
de tales personas como vuestro parecer muestra, bien se echa de ver que ha
de ser muy grande.
— Decidme, señor —dijo Dorotea—: ¿esta señora es cristiana o mora? Porque el
traje y el silencio nos hace pensar que es lo que no querríamos que fuese.
— Mora es en el traje y en el cuerpo, pero en el alma es muy grande
cristiana, porque tiene grandísimos deseos de serlo.
— Luego, ¿no es baptizada? —replicó Luscinda.
— No ha habido lugar para ello —respondió el captivo— después que salió de
Argel, su patria y tierra, y hasta agora no se ha visto en peligro de
muerte tan cercana que obligase a baptizalla sin que supiese primero todas
las ceremonias que nuestra Madre la Santa Iglesia manda; pero Dios será
servido que presto se bautice con la decencia que la calidad de su persona
merece, que es más de lo que muestra su hábito y el mío.
Con estas razones puso gana en todos los que escuchándole estaban de
saber quién fuese la mora y el captivo, pero nadie se lo quiso preguntar
por entonces, por ver que aquella sazón era más para procurarles descanso
que para preguntarles sus vidas. Dorotea la tomó por la mano y la llevó a
sentar junto a sí, y le rogó que se quitase el embozo. Ella miró al
cautivo, como si le preguntara le dijese lo que decían y lo que ella haría.
Él, en lengua arábiga, le dijo que le pedían se quitase el embozo, y que lo
hiciese; y así, se lo quitó, y descubrió un rostro tan hermoso que Dorotea
la tuvo por más hermosa que a Luscinda, y Luscinda por más hermosa que a
Dorotea, y todos los circustantes conocieron que si alguno se podría
igualar al de las dos, era el de la mora, y aun hubo algunos que le
aventajaron en alguna cosa. Y, como la hermosura tenga prerrogativa y
gracia de reconciliar los ánimos y atraer las voluntades, luego se
rindieron todos al deseo de servir y acariciar a la hermosa mora.
Preguntó don Fernando al captivo cómo se llamaba la mora, el cual respondió
que lela Zoraida; y, así como esto oyó, ella entendió lo que le habían
preguntado al cristiano, y dijo con mucha priesa, llena de congoja y
donaire:
— ¡No, no Zoraida: María, María! —dando a entender que se llamaba María y no
Zoraida.
Estas palabras, el grande afecto con que la mora las dijo, hicieron
derramar más de una lágrima a algunos de los que la escucharon,
especialmente a las mujeres, que de su naturaleza son tiernas y compasivas.
Abrazóla Luscinda con mucho amor, diciéndole:
— Sí, sí: María, María.
A lo cual respondió la mora:
— ¡Sí, sí: María; Zoraida macange! —que quiere decir no.
Ya en esto llegaba la noche, y, por orden de los que venían con don
Fernando, había el ventero puesto diligencia y cuidado en aderezarles de
cenar lo mejor que a él le fue posible. Llegada, pues, la hora, sentáronse
todos a una larga mesa, como de tinelo, porque no la había redonda ni
cuadrada en la venta, y dieron la cabecera y principal asiento, puesto que
él lo rehusaba, a don Quijote, el cual quiso que estuviese a su lado la
señora Micomicona, pues él era su aguardador. Luego se sentaron Luscinda y
Zoraida, y frontero dellas don Fernando y Cardenio, y luego el cautivo y
los demás caballeros, y, al lado de las señoras, el cura y el barbero. Y
así, cenaron con mucho contento, y acrecentóseles más viendo que, dejando
de comer don Quijote, movido de otro semejante espíritu que el que le movió
a hablar tanto como habló cuando cenó con los cabreros, comenzó a decir:
— Verdaderamente, si bien se considera, señores míos, grandes e inauditas
cosas ven los que profesan la orden de la andante caballería. Si no, ¿cuál
de los vivientes habrá en el mundo que ahora por la puerta deste castillo
entrara, y de la suerte que estamos nos viere, que juzgue y crea que
nosotros somos quien somos? ¿Quién podrá decir que esta señora que está a
mi lado es la gran reina que todos sabemos, y que yo soy aquel Caballero de
la Triste Figura que anda por ahí en boca de la fama? Ahora no hay que
dudar, sino que esta arte y ejercicio excede a todas aquellas y aquellos
que los hombres inventaron, y tanto más se ha de tener en estima cuanto a
más peligros está sujeto. Quítenseme delante los que dijeren que las letras
hacen ventaja a las armas, que les diré, y sean quien se fueren, que no
saben lo que dicen. Porque la razón que los tales suelen decir, y a lo que
ellos más se atienen, es que los trabajos del espíritu exceden a los del
cuerpo, y que las armas sólo con el cuerpo se ejercitan, como si fuese su
ejercicio oficio de ganapanes, para el cual no es menester más de buenas
fuerzas; o como si en esto que llamamos armas los que las profesamos no se
encerrasen los actos de la fortaleza, los cuales piden para ejecutallos
mucho entendimiento; o como si no trabajase el ánimo del guerrero que tiene
a su cargo un ejército, o la defensa de una ciudad sitiada, así con el
espíritu como con el cuerpo. Si no, véase si se alcanza con las fuerzas
corporales a saber y conjeturar el intento del enemigo, los disignios, las
estratagemas, las dificultades, el prevenir los daños que se temen; que
todas estas cosas son acciones del entendimiento, en quien no tiene parte
alguna el cuerpo. Siendo pues ansí, que las armas requieren espíritu, como
las letras, veamos ahora cuál de los dos espíritus, el del letrado o el del
guerrero, trabaja más. Y esto se vendrá a conocer por el fin y paradero a
que cada uno se encamina, porque aquella intención se ha de estimar en más
que tiene por objeto más noble fin. Es el fin y paradero de las letras...,
y no hablo ahora de las divinas, que tienen por blanco llevar y encaminar
las almas al cielo, que a un fin tan sin fin como éste ninguno otro se le
puede igualar; hablo de las letras humanas, que es su fin poner en su punto
la justicia distributiva y dar a cada uno lo que es suyo, entender y hacer
que las buenas leyes se guarden. Fin, por cierto, generoso y alto y digno
de grande alabanza, pero no de tanta como merece aquel a que las armas
atienden, las cuales tienen por objeto y fin la paz, que es el mayor bien
que los hombres pueden desear en esta vida. Y así, las primeras buenas
nuevas que tuvo el mundo y tuvieron los hombres fueron las que dieron los
ángeles la noche que fue nuestro día, cuando cantaron en los aires:
''Gloria sea en las alturas, y paz en la tierra, a los hombres de buena
voluntad''; y a la salutación que el mejor maestro de la tierra y del cielo
enseñó a sus allegados y favoridos, fue decirles que cuando entrasen en
alguna casa, dijesen: ''Paz sea en esta casa''; y otras muchas veces les
dijo: ''Mi paz os doy, mi paz os dejo: paz sea con vosotros'', bien como
joya y prenda dada y dejada de tal mano; joya que sin ella, en la tierra ni
en el cielo puede haber bien alguno. Esta paz es el verdadero fin de la
guerra, que lo mesmo es decir armas que guerra. Prosupuesta, pues, esta
verdad, que el fin de la guerra es la paz, y que en esto hace ventaja al
fin de las letras, vengamos ahora a los trabajos del cuerpo del letrado y a
los del profesor de las armas, y véase cuáles son mayores.
De tal manera, y por tan buenos términos, iba prosiguiendo en su plática
don Quijote que obligó a que, por entonces, ninguno de los que escuchándole
estaban le tuviese por loco; antes, como todos los más eran caballeros, a
quien son anejas las armas, le escuchaban de muy buena gana; y él prosiguió
diciendo:
— Digo, pues, que los trabajos del estudiante son éstos: principalmente
pobreza (no porque todos sean pobres, sino por poner este caso en todo el
estremo que pueda ser); y, en haber dicho que padece pobreza, me parece que
no había que decir más de su mala ventura, porque quien es pobre no tiene
cosa buena. Esta pobreza la padece por sus partes, ya en hambre, ya en
frío, ya en desnudez, ya en todo junto; pero, con todo eso, no es tanta que
no coma, aunque sea un poco más tarde de lo que se usa, aunque sea de las
sobras de los ricos; que es la mayor miseria del estudiante éste que entre
ellos llaman andar a la sopa; y no les falta algún ajeno brasero o
chimenea, que, si no callenta, a lo menos entibie su frío, y, en fin, la
noche duermen debajo de cubierta. No quiero llegar a otras menudencias,
conviene a saber, de la falta de camisas y no sobra de zapatos, la raridad
y poco pelo del vestido, ni aquel ahitarse con tanto gusto, cuando la buena
suerte les depara algún banquete. Por este camino que he pintado, áspero y
dificultoso, tropezando aquí, cayendo allí, levantándose acullá, tornando a
caer acá, llegan al grado que desean; el cual alcanzado, a muchos hemos
visto que, habiendo pasado por estas Sirtes y por estas Scilas y Caribdis,
como llevados en vuelo de la favorable fortuna, digo que los hemos visto
mandar y gobernar el mundo desde una silla, trocada su hambre en hartura,
su frío en refrigerio, su desnudez en galas, y su dormir en una estera en
reposar en holandas y damascos: premio justamente merecido de su virtud.
Pero, contrapuestos y comparados sus trabajos con los del mílite guerrero,
se quedan muy atrás en todo, como ahora diré.
Capítulo XXXVIII. Que trata del curioso discurso que hizo don Quijote de
las armas y las letras
Prosiguiendo don Quijote, dijo:
— Pues comenzamos en el estudiante por la pobreza y sus partes, veamos si es
más rico el soldado. Y veremos que no hay ninguno más pobre en la misma
pobreza, porque está atenido a la miseria de su paga, que viene o tarde o
nunca, o a lo que garbeare por sus manos, con notable peligro de su vida y
de su conciencia. Y a veces suele ser su desnudez tanta, que un coleto
acuchillado le sirve de gala y de camisa, y en la mitad del invierno se
suele reparar de las inclemencias del cielo, estando en la campaña rasa,
con sólo el aliento de su boca, que, como sale de lugar vacío, tengo por
averiguado que debe de salir frío, contra toda naturaleza. Pues esperad que
espere que llegue la noche, para restaurarse de todas estas incomodidades,
en la cama que le aguarda, la cual, si no es por su culpa, jamás pecará de
estrecha; que bien puede medir en la tierra los pies que quisiere, y
revolverse en ella a su sabor, sin temor que se le encojan las sábanas.
Lléguese, pues, a todo esto, el día y la hora de recebir el grado de su
ejercicio; lléguese un día de batalla, que allí le pondrán la borla en la
cabeza, hecha de hilas, para curarle algún balazo, que quizá le habrá
pasado las sienes, o le dejará estropeado de brazo o pierna. Y, cuando esto
no suceda, sino que el cielo piadoso le guarde y conserve sano y vivo,
podrá ser que se quede en la mesma pobreza que antes estaba, y que sea
menester que suceda uno y otro rencuentro, una y otra batalla, y que de
todas salga vencedor, para medrar en algo; pero estos milagros vense raras
veces. Pero, decidme, señores, si habéis mirado en ello: ¿cuán menos son
los premiados por la guerra que los que han perecido en ella? Sin duda,
habéis de responder que no tienen comparación, ni se pueden reducir a
cuenta los muertos, y que se podrán contar los premiados vivos con tres
letras de guarismo. Todo esto es al revés en los letrados; porque, de
faldas, que no quiero decir de mangas, todos tienen en qué entretenerse.
Así que, aunque es mayor el trabajo del soldado, es mucho menor el premio.
Pero a esto se puede responder que es más fácil premiar a dos mil letrados
que a treinta mil soldados, porque a aquéllos se premian con darles
oficios, que por fuerza se han de dar a los de su profesión, y a éstos no
se pueden premiar sino con la mesma hacienda del señor a quien sirven; y
esta imposibilidad fortifica más la razón que tengo. Pero dejemos esto
aparte, que es laberinto de muy dificultosa salida, sino volvamos a la
preeminencia de las armas contra las letras, materia que hasta ahora está
por averiguar, según son las razones que cada una de su parte alega. Y,
entre las que he dicho, dicen las letras que sin ellas no se podrían
sustentar las armas, porque la guerra también tiene sus leyes y está sujeta
a ellas, y que las leyes caen debajo de lo que son letras y letrados. A
esto responden las armas que las leyes no se podrán sustentar sin ellas,
porque con las armas se defienden las repúblicas, se conservan los reinos,
se guardan las ciudades, se aseguran los caminos, se despejan los mares de
cosarios; y, finalmente, si por ellas no fuese, las repúblicas, los reinos,
las monarquías, las ciudades, los caminos de mar y tierra estarían sujetos
al rigor y a la confusión que trae consigo la guerra el tiempo que dura y
tiene licencia de usar de sus previlegios y de sus fuerzas. Y es razón
averiguada que aquello que más cuesta se estima y debe de estimar en más.
Alcanzar alguno a ser eminente en letras le cuesta tiempo, vigilias,
hambre, desnudez, váguidos de cabeza, indigestiones de estómago, y otras
cosas a éstas adherentes, que, en parte, ya las tengo referidas; mas llegar
uno por sus términos a ser buen soldado le cuesta todo lo que a el
estudiante, en tanto mayor grado que no tiene comparación, porque a cada
paso está a pique de perder la vida. Y ¿qué temor de necesidad y pobreza
puede llegar ni fatigar al estudiante, que llegue al que tiene un soldado,
que, hallándose cercado en alguna fuerza, y estando de posta, o guarda, en
algún revellín o caballero, siente que los enemigos están minando hacia la
parte donde él está, y no puede apartarse de allí por ningún caso, ni huir
el peligro que de tan cerca le amenaza? Sólo lo que puede hacer es dar
noticia a su capitán de lo que pasa, para que lo remedie con alguna
contramina, y él estarse quedo, temiendo y esperando cuándo improvisamente
ha de subir a las nubes sin alas y bajar al profundo sin su voluntad. Y si
éste parece pequeño peligro, veamos si le iguala o hace ventajas el de
embestirse dos galeras por las proas en mitad del mar espacioso, las cuales
enclavijadas y trabadas, no le queda al soldado más espacio del que concede
dos pies de tabla del espolón; y, con todo esto, viendo que tiene delante
de sí tantos ministros de la muerte que le amenazan cuantos cañones de
artillería se asestan de la parte contraria, que no distan de su cuerpo una
lanza, y viendo que al primer descuido de los pies iría a visitar los
profundos senos de Neptuno; y, con todo esto, con intrépido corazón,
llevado de la honra que le incita, se pone a ser blanco de tanta
arcabucería, y procura pasar por tan estrecho paso al bajel contrario. Y lo
que más es de admirar: que apenas uno ha caído donde no se podrá levantar
hasta la fin del mundo, cuando otro ocupa su mesmo lugar; y si éste también
cae en el mar, que como a enemigo le aguarda, otro y otro le sucede, sin
dar tiempo al tiempo de sus muertes: valentía y atrevimiento el mayor que
se puede hallar en todos los trances de la guerra. Bien hayan aquellos
benditos siglos que carecieron de la espantable furia de aquestos
endemoniados instrumentos de la artillería, a cuyo inventor tengo para mí
que en el infierno se le está dando el premio de su diabólica invención,
con la cual dio causa que un infame y cobarde brazo quite la vida a un
valeroso caballero, y que, sin saber cómo o por dónde, en la mitad del
coraje y brío que enciende y anima a los valientes pechos, llega una
desmandada bala, disparada de quien quizá huyó y se espantó del resplandor
que hizo el fuego al disparar de la maldita máquina, y corta y acaba en un
instante los pensamientos y vida de quien la merecía gozar luengos siglos.
Y así, considerando esto, estoy por decir que en el alma me pesa de haber
tomado este ejercicio de caballero andante en edad tan detestable como es
esta en que ahora vivimos; porque, aunque a mí ningún peligro me pone
miedo, todavía me pone recelo pensar si la pólvora y el estaño me han de
quitar la ocasión de hacerme famoso y conocido por el valor de mi brazo y
filos de mi espada, por todo lo descubierto de la tierra. Pero haga el
cielo lo que fuere servido, que tanto seré más estimado, si salgo con lo
que pretendo, cuanto a mayores peligros me he puesto que se pusieron los
caballeros andantes de los pasados siglos.
Todo este largo preámbulo dijo don Quijote, en tanto que los demás cenaban,
olvidándose de llevar bocado a la boca, puesto que algunas veces le había
dicho Sancho Panza que cenase, que después habría lugar para decir todo lo
que quisiese. En los que escuchado le habían sobrevino nueva lástima de ver
que hombre que, al parecer, tenía buen entendimiento y buen discurso en
todas las cosas que trataba, le hubiese perdido tan rematadamente, en
tratándole de su negra y pizmienta caballería. El cura le dijo que tenía
mucha razón en todo cuanto había dicho en favor de las armas, y que él,
aunque letrado y graduado, estaba de su mesmo parecer.
Acabaron de cenar, levantaron los manteles, y, en tanto que la ventera, su
hija y Maritornes aderezaban el camaranchón de don Quijote de la Mancha,
donde habían determinado que aquella noche las mujeres solas en él se
recogiesen, don Fernando rogó al cautivo les contase el discurso de su
vida, porque no podría ser sino que fuese peregrino y gustoso, según las
muestras que había comenzado a dar, viniendo en compañía de Zoraida. A lo
cual respondió el cautivo que de muy buena gana haría lo que se le mandaba,
y que sólo temía que el cuento no había de ser tal, que les diese el gusto
que él deseaba; pero que, con todo eso, por no faltar en obedecelle, le
contaría. El cura y todos los demás se lo agradecieron, y de nuevo se lo
rogaron; y él, viéndose rogar de tantos, dijo que no eran menester ruegos
adonde el mandar tenía tanta fuerza.
— Y así, estén vuestras mercedes atentos, y oirán un discurso verdadero, a
quien podría ser que no llegasen los mentirosos que con curioso y pensado
artificio suelen componerse.
Con esto que dijo, hizo que todos se acomodasen y le prestasen un grande
silencio; y él, viendo que ya callaban y esperaban lo que decir quisiese,
con voz agradable y reposada, comenzó a decir desta manera:
Capítulo XXXIX. Donde el cautivo cuenta su vida y sucesos
— «En un lugar de las Montañas de León tuvo principio mi linaje, con quien
fue más agradecida y liberal la naturaleza que la fortuna, aunque, en la
estrecheza de aquellos pueblos, todavía alcanzaba mi padre fama de rico, y
verdaderamente lo fuera si así se diera maña a conservar su hacienda como
se la daba en gastalla. Y la condición que tenía de ser liberal y gastador
le procedió de haber sido soldado los años de su joventud, que es escuela
la soldadesca donde el mezquino se hace franco, y el franco, pródigo; y si
algunos soldados se hallan miserables, son como monstruos, que se ven raras
veces. Pasaba mi padre los términos de la liberalidad, y rayaba en los de
ser pródigo: cosa que no le es de ningún provecho al hombre casado, y que
tiene hijos que le han de suceder en el nombre y en el ser. Los que mi
padre tenía eran tres, todos varones y todos de edad de poder elegir
estado. Viendo, pues, mi padre que, según él decía, no podía irse a la mano
contra su condición, quiso privarse del instrumento y causa que le hacía
gastador y dadivoso, que fue privarse de la hacienda, sin la cual el mismo
Alejandro pareciera estrecho.
»Y así, llamándonos un día a todos tres a solas en un aposento, nos dijo
unas razones semejantes a las que ahora diré: ''Hijos, para deciros que os
quiero bien, basta saber y decir que sois mis hijos; y, para entender que
os quiero mal, basta saber que no me voy a la mano en lo que toca a
conservar vuestra hacienda. Pues, para que entendáis desde aquí adelante
que os quiero como padre, y que no os quiero destruir como padrastro,
quiero hacer una cosa con vosotros que ha muchos días que la tengo pensada
y con madura consideración dispuesta. Vosotros estáis ya en edad de tomar
estado, o, a lo menos, de elegir ejercicio, tal que, cuando mayores, os
honre y aproveche. Y lo que he pensado es hacer de mi hacienda cuatro
partes: las tres os daré a vosotros, a cada uno lo que le tocare, sin
exceder en cosa alguna, y con la otra me quedaré yo para vivir y
sustentarme los días que el cielo fuere servido de darme de vida. Pero
querría que, después que cada uno tuviese en su poder la parte que le toca
de su hacienda, siguiese uno de los caminos que le diré. Hay un refrán en
nuestra España, a mi parecer muy verdadero, como todos lo son, por ser
sentencias breves sacadas de la luenga y discreta experiencia; y el que yo
digo dice: "Iglesia, o mar, o casa real", como si más claramente dijera:
"Quien quisiere valer y ser rico, siga o la Iglesia, o navegue, ejercitando
el arte de la mercancía, o entre a servir a los reyes en sus casas"; porque
dicen: "Más vale migaja de rey que merced de señor". Digo esto porque
querría, y es mi voluntad, que uno de vosotros siguiese las letras, el otro
la mercancía, y el otro sirviese al rey en la guerra, pues es dificultoso
entrar a servirle en su casa; que, ya que la guerra no dé muchas riquezas,
suele dar mucho valor y mucha fama. Dentro de ocho días, os daré toda
vuestra parte en dineros, sin defraudaros en un ardite, como lo veréis por
la obra. Decidme ahora si queréis seguir mi parecer y consejo en lo que os
he propuesto''. Y, mandándome a mí, por ser el mayor, que respondiese,
después de haberle dicho que no se deshiciese de la hacienda, sino que
gastase todo lo que fuese su voluntad, que nosotros éramos mozos para saber
ganarla, vine a concluir en que cumpliría su gusto, y que el mío era seguir
el ejercicio de las armas, sirviendo en él a Dios y a mi rey. El segundo
hermano hizo los mesmos ofrecimientos, y escogió el irse a las Indias,
llevando empleada la hacienda que le cupiese. El menor, y, a lo que yo
creo, el más discreto, dijo que quería seguir la Iglesia, o irse a acabar
sus comenzados estudios a Salamanca. Así como acabamos de concordarnos y
escoger nuestros ejercicios, mi padre nos abrazó a todos, y, con la
brevedad que dijo, puso por obra cuanto nos había prometido; y, dando a
cada uno su parte, que, a lo que se me acuerda, fueron cada tres mil
ducados, en dineros (porque un nuestro tío compró toda la hacienda y la
pagó de contado, porque no saliese del tronco de la casa), en un mesmo día
nos despedimos todos tres de nuestro buen padre; y, en aquel mesmo,
pareciéndome a mí ser inhumanidad que mi padre quedase viejo y con tan poca
hacienda, hice con él que de mis tres mil tomase los dos mil ducados,
porque a mí me bastaba el resto para acomodarme de lo que había menester un
soldado. Mis dos hermanos, movidos de mi ejemplo, cada uno le dio mil
ducados: de modo que a mi padre le quedaron cuatro mil en dineros, y más
tres mil, que, a lo que parece, valía la hacienda que le cupo, que no quiso
vender, sino quedarse con ella en raíces. Digo, en fin, que nos despedimos
dél y de aquel nuestro tío que he dicho, no sin mucho sentimiento y
lágrimas de todos, encargándonos que les hiciésemos saber, todas las veces
que hubiese comodidad para ello, de nuestros sucesos, prósperos o adversos.
Prometímosselo, y, abrazándonos y echándonos su bendición, el uno tomó el
viaje de Salamanca, el otro de Sevilla y yo el de Alicante, adonde tuve
nuevas que había una nave ginovesa que cargaba allí lana para Génova.
»Éste hará veinte y dos años que salí de casa de mi padre, y en todos
ellos, puesto que he escrito algunas cartas, no he sabido dél ni de mis
hermanos nueva alguna. Y lo que en este discurso de tiempo he pasado lo
diré brevemente. Embarquéme en Alicante, llegué con próspero viaje a
Génova, fui desde allí a Milán, donde me acomodé de armas y de algunas
galas de soldado, de donde quise ir a asentar mi plaza al Piamonte; y,
estando ya de camino para Alejandría de la Palla, tuve nuevas que el gran
duque de Alba pasaba a Flandes. Mudé propósito, fuime con él, servíle en
las jornadas que hizo, halléme en la muerte de los condes de Eguemón y de
Hornos, alcancé a ser alférez de un famoso capitán de Guadalajara, llamado
Diego de Urbina; y, a cabo de algún tiempo que llegué a Flandes, se tuvo
nuevas de la liga que la Santidad del Papa Pío Quinto, de felice
recordación, había hecho con Venecia y con España, contra el enemigo común,
que es el Turco; el cual, en aquel mesmo tiempo, había ganado con su armada
la famosa isla de Chipre, que estaba debajo del dominio del veneciano: y
pérdida lamentable y desdichada. Súpose cierto que venía por general desta
liga el serenísimo don Juan de Austria, hermano natural de nuestro buen rey
don Felipe. Divulgóse el grandísimo aparato de guerra que se hacía. Todo lo
cual me incitó y conmovió el ánimo y el deseo de verme en la jornada que se
esperaba; y, aunque tenía barruntos, y casi promesas ciertas, de que en la
primera ocasión que se ofreciese sería promovido a capitán, lo quise dejar
todo y venirme, como me vine, a Italia. Y quiso mi buena suerte que el
señor don Juan de Austria acababa de llegar a Génova, que pasaba a Nápoles
a juntarse con la armada de Venecia, como después lo hizo en Mecina.
»Digo, en fin, que yo me hallé en aquella felicísima jornada, ya hecho
capitán de infantería, a cuyo honroso cargo me subió mi buena suerte, más
que mis merecimientos. Y aquel día, que fue para la cristiandad tan
dichoso, porque en él se desengañó el mundo y todas las naciones del error
en que estaban, creyendo que los turcos eran invencibles por la mar: en
aquel día, digo, donde quedó el orgullo y soberbia otomana quebrantada,
entre tantos venturosos como allí hubo (porque más ventura tuvieron los
cristianos que allí murieron que los que vivos y vencedores quedaron), yo
solo fui el desdichado, pues, en cambio de que pudiera esperar, si fuera en
los romanos siglos, alguna naval corona, me vi aquella noche que siguió a
tan famoso día con cadenas a los pies y esposas a las manos.
»Y fue desta suerte: que, habiendo el Uchalí, rey de Argel, atrevido y
venturoso cosario, embestido y rendido la capitana de Malta, que solos tres
caballeros quedaron vivos en ella, y éstos malheridos, acudió la capitana
de Juan Andrea a socorrella, en la cual yo iba con mi compañía; y, haciendo
lo que debía en ocasión semejante, salté en la galera contraria, la cual,
desviándose de la que la había embestido, estorbó que mis soldados me
siguiesen, y así, me hallé solo entre mis enemigos, a quien no pude
resistir, por ser tantos; en fin, me rindieron lleno de heridas. Y, como ya
habréis, señores, oído decir que el Uchalí se salvó con toda su escuadra,
vine yo a quedar cautivo en su poder, y solo fui el triste entre tantos
alegres y el cautivo entre tantos libres; porque fueron quince mil
cristianos los que aquel día alcanzaron la deseada libertad, que todos
venían al remo en la turquesca armada.
»Lleváronme a Costantinopla, donde el Gran Turco Selim hizo general de la
mar a mi amo, porque había hecho su deber en la batalla, habiendo llevado
por muestra de su valor el estandarte de la religión de Malta. Halléme el
segundo año, que fue el de setenta y dos, en Navarino, bogando en la
capitana de los tres fanales. Vi y noté la ocasión que allí se perdió de no
coger en el puerto toda el armada turquesca, porque todos los leventes y
jenízaros que en ella venían tuvieron por cierto que les habían de embestir
dentro del mesmo puerto, y tenían a punto su ropa y pasamaques, que son sus
zapatos, para huirse luego por tierra, sin esperar ser combatidos: tanto
era el miedo que habían cobrado a nuestra armada. Pero el cielo lo ordenó
de otra manera, no por culpa ni descuido del general que a los nuestros
regía, sino por los pecados de la cristiandad, y porque quiere y permite
Dios que tengamos siempre verdugos que nos castiguen.
»En efeto, el Uchalí se recogió a Modón, que es una isla que está junto a
Navarino, y, echando la gente en tierra, fortificó la boca del puerto, y
estúvose quedo hasta que el señor don Juan se volvió. En este viaje se tomó
la galera que se llamaba La Presa, de quien era capitán un hijo de aquel
famoso cosario Barbarroja. Tomóla la capitana de Nápoles, llamada La Loba,
regida por aquel rayo de la guerra, por el padre de los soldados, por aquel
venturoso y jamás vencido capitán don Álvaro de Bazán, marqués de Santa
Cruz. Y no quiero dejar de decir lo que sucedió en la presa de La Presa.
Era tan cruel el hijo de Barbarroja, y trataba tan mal a sus cautivos, que,
así como los que venían al remo vieron que la galera Loba les iba entrando
y que los alcanzaba, soltaron todos a un tiempo los remos, y asieron de su
capitán, que estaba sobre el estanterol gritando que bogasen apriesa, y
pasándole de banco en banco, de popa a proa, le dieron bocados, que a poco
más que pasó del árbol ya había pasado su ánima al infierno: tal era, como
he dicho, la crueldad con que los trataba y el odio que ellos le tenían.
»Volvimos a Constantinopla, y el año siguiente, que fue el de setenta y
tres, se supo en ella cómo el señor don Juan había ganado a Túnez, y
quitado aquel reino a los turcos y puesto en posesión dél a Muley Hamet,
cortando las esperanzas que de volver a reinar en él tenía Muley Hamida, el
moro más cruel y más valiente que tuvo el mundo. Sintió mucho esta pérdida
el Gran Turco, y, usando de la sagacidad que todos los de su casa tienen,
hizo paz con venecianos, que mucho más que él la deseaban; y el año
siguiente de setenta y cuatro acometió a la Goleta y al fuerte que junto a
Túnez había dejado medio levantado el señor don Juan. En todos estos
trances andaba yo al remo, sin esperanza de libertad alguna; a lo menos, no
esperaba tenerla por rescate, porque tenía determinado de no escribir las
nuevas de mi desgracia a mi padre.
»Perdióse, en fin, la Goleta; perdióse el fuerte, sobre las cuales plazas
hubo de soldados turcos, pagados, setenta y cinco mil, y de moros, y
alárabes de toda la Africa, más de cuatrocientos mil, acompañado este tan
gran número de gente con tantas municiones y pertrechos de guerra, y con
tantos gastadores, que con las manos y a puñados de tierra pudieran cubrir
la Goleta y el fuerte. Perdióse primero la Goleta, tenida hasta entonces
por inexpugnable; y no se perdió por culpa de sus defensores, los cuales
hicieron en su defensa todo aquello que debían y podían, sino porque la
experiencia mostró la facilidad con que se podían levantar trincheas en
aquella desierta arena, porque a dos palmos se hallaba agua, y los turcos
no la hallaron a dos varas; y así, con muchos sacos de arena levantaron las
trincheas tan altas que sobrepujaban las murallas de la fuerza; y,
tirándoles a caballero, ninguno podía parar, ni asistir a la defensa. Fue
común opinión que no se habían de encerrar los nuestros en la Goleta, sino
esperar en campaña al desembarcadero; y los que esto dicen hablan de lejos
y con poca experiencia de casos semejantes, porque si en la Goleta y en el
fuerte apenas había siete mil soldados, ¿cómo podía tan poco número, aunque
más esforzados fuesen, salir a la campaña y quedar en las fuerzas, contra
tanto como era el de los enemigos?; y ¿cómo es posible dejar de perderse
fuerza que no es socorrida, y más cuando la cercan enemigos muchos y
porfiados, y en su mesma tierra? Pero a muchos les pareció, y así me
pareció a mí, que fue particular gracia y merced que el cielo hizo a España
en permitir que se asolase aquella oficina y capa de maldades, y aquella
gomia o esponja y polilla de la infinidad de dineros que allí sin provecho
se gastaban, sin servir de otra cosa que de conservar la memoria de haberla
ganado la felicísima del invictísimo Carlos Quinto; como si fuera menester
para hacerla eterna, como lo es y será, que aquellas piedras la
sustentaran.
»Perdióse también el fuerte; pero fuéronle ganando los turcos palmo a
palmo, porque los soldados que lo defendían pelearon tan valerosa y
fuertemente, que pasaron de veinte y cinco mil enemigos los que mataron en
veinte y dos asaltos generales que les dieron. Ninguno cautivaron sano de
trecientos que quedaron vivos, señal cierta y clara de su esfuerzo y valor,
y de lo bien que se habían defendido y guardado sus plazas. Rindióse a
partido un pequeño fuerte o torre que estaba en mitad del estaño, a cargo
de don Juan Zanoguera, caballero valenciano y famoso soldado. Cautivaron a
don Pedro Puertocarrero, general de la Goleta, el cual hizo cuanto fue
posible por defender su fuerza; y sintió tanto el haberla perdido que de
pesar murió en el camino de Constantinopla, donde le llevaban cautivo.
Cautivaron ansimesmo al general del fuerte, que se llamaba Gabrio
Cervellón, caballero milanés, grande ingeniero y valentísimo soldado.
Murieron en estas dos fuerzas muchas personas de cuenta, de las cuales fue
una Pagán de Oria, caballero del hábito de San Juan, de condición generoso,
como lo mostró la summa liberalidad que usó con su hermano, el famoso Juan
de Andrea de Oria; y lo que más hizo lastimosa su muerte fue haber muerto a
manos de unos alárabes de quien se fió, viendo ya perdido el fuerte, que se
ofrecieron de llevarle en hábito de moro a Tabarca, que es un portezuelo o
casa que en aquellas riberas tienen los ginoveses que se ejercitan en la
pesquería del coral; los cuales alárabes le cortaron la cabeza y se la
trujeron al general de la armada turquesca, el cual cumplió con ellos
nuestro refrán castellano: "Que aunque la traición aplace, el traidor se
aborrece"; y así, se dice que mandó el general ahorcar a los que le
trujeron el presente, porque no se le habían traído vivo.
»Entre los cristianos que en el fuerte se perdieron, fue uno llamado don
Pedro de Aguilar, natural no sé de qué lugar del Andalucía, el cual había
sido alférez en el fuerte, soldado de mucha cuenta y de raro entendimiento:
especialmente tenía particular gracia en lo que llaman poesía. Dígolo
porque su suerte le trujo a mi galera y a mi banco, y a ser esclavo de mi
mesmo patrón; y, antes que nos partiésemos de aquel puerto, hizo este
caballero dos sonetos, a manera de epitafios, el uno a la Goleta y el otro
al fuerte. Y en verdad que los tengo de decir, porque los sé de memoria y
creo que antes causarán gusto que pesadumbre.»
En el punto que el cautivo nombró a don Pedro de Aguilar, don Fernando miró
a sus camaradas, y todos tres se sonrieron; y, cuando llegó a decir de los
sonetos, dijo el uno:
— Antes que vuestra merced pase adelante, le suplico me diga qué se hizo ese
don Pedro de Aguilar que ha dicho.
— Lo que sé es —respondió el cautivo— que, al cabo de dos años que estuvo en
Constantinopla, se huyó en traje de arnaúte con un griego espía, y no sé si
vino en libertad, puesto que creo que sí, porque de allí a un año vi yo al
griego en Constantinopla, y no le pude preguntar el suceso de aquel viaje.
— Pues lo fue —respondió el caballero—, porque ese don Pedro es mi hermano,
y está ahora en nuestro lugar, bueno y rico, casado y con tres hijos.
— Gracias sean dadas a Dios —dijo el cautivo— por tantas mercedes como le
hizo; porque no hay en la tierra, conforme mi parecer, contento que se
iguale a alcanzar la libertad perdida.
— Y más —replicó el caballero—, que yo sé los sonetos que mi hermano hizo.
— Dígalos, pues, vuestra merced —dijo el cautivo—, que los sabrá decir mejor
que yo.
— Que me place —respondió el caballero—; y el de la Goleta decía así:
Capítulo XL. Donde se prosigue la historia del cautivo
Soneto
Almas dichosas que del mortal velo
libres y esentas, por el bien que obrastes,
desde la baja tierra os levantastes
a lo más alto y lo mejor del cielo,
y, ardiendo en ira y en honroso celo,
de los cuerpos la fuerza ejercitastes,
que en propia y sangre ajena colorastes
el mar vecino y arenoso suelo;
primero que el valor faltó la vida
en los cansados brazos, que, muriendo,
con ser vencidos, llevan la vitoria.
Y esta vuestra mortal, triste caída
entre el muro y el hierro, os va adquiriendo
fama que el mundo os da, y el cielo gloria.
— Desa mesma manera le sé yo —dijo el cautivo.
— Pues el del fuerte, si mal no me acuerdo —dijo el caballero—, dice así:
Soneto
De entre esta tierra estéril, derribada,
destos terrones por el suelo echados,
las almas santas de tres mil soldados
subieron vivas a mejor morada,
siendo primero, en vano, ejercitada
la fuerza de sus brazos esforzados,
hasta que, al fin, de pocos y cansados,
dieron la vida al filo de la espada.
Y éste es el suelo que continuo ha sido
de mil memorias lamentables lleno
en los pasados siglos y presentes.
Mas no más justas de su duro seno
habrán al claro cielo almas subido,
ni aun él sostuvo cuerpos tan valientes.
No parecieron mal los sonetos, y el cautivo se alegró con las nuevas que de
su camarada le dieron; y, prosiguiendo su cuento, dijo:
— «Rendidos, pues, la Goleta y el fuerte, los turcos dieron orden en
desmantelar la Goleta, porque el fuerte quedó tal, que no hubo qué poner
por tierra, y para hacerlo con más brevedad y menos trabajo, la minaron por
tres partes; pero con ninguna se pudo volar lo que parecía menos fuerte,
que eran las murallas viejas; y todo aquello que había quedado en pie de la
fortificación nueva que había hecho el Fratín, con mucha facilidad vino a
tierra. En resolución, la armada volvió a Constantinopla, triunfante y
vencedora: y de allí a pocos meses murió mi amo el Uchalí, al cual llamaban
Uchalí Fartax, que quiere decir, en lengua turquesca, el renegado tiñoso,
porque lo era; y es costumbre entre los turcos ponerse nombres de alguna
falta que tengan, o de alguna virtud que en ellos haya. Y esto es porque no
hay entre ellos sino cuatro apellidos de linajes, que decienden de la casa
Otomana, y los demás, como tengo dicho, toman nombre y apellido ya de las
tachas del cuerpo y ya de las virtudes del ánimo. Y este Tiñoso bogó el
remo, siendo esclavo del Gran Señor, catorce años, y a más de los treinta y
cuatro de sus edad renegó, de despecho de que un turco, estando al remo,
le dio un bofetón, y por poderse vengar dejó su fe; y fue tanto su valor
que, sin subir por los torpes medios y caminos que los más privados del
Gran Turco suben, vino a ser rey de Argel, y después, a ser general de la
mar, que es el tercero cargo que hay en aquel señorío. Era calabrés de
nación, y moralmente fue un hombre de bien, y trataba con mucha humanidad a
sus cautivos, que llegó a tener tres mil, los cuales, después de su muerte,
se repartieron, como él lo dejó en su testamento, entre el Gran Señor (que
también es hijo heredero de cuantos mueren, y entra a la parte con los más
hijos que deja el difunto) y entre sus renegados; y yo cupe a un renegado
veneciano que, siendo grumete de una nave, le cautivó el Uchalí, y le quiso
tanto, que fue uno de los más regalados garzones suyos, y él vino a ser el
más cruel renegado que jamás se ha visto. Llamábase Azán Agá, y llegó a ser
muy rico, y a ser rey de Argel; con el cual yo vine de Constantinopla, algo
contento, por estar tan cerca de España, no porque pensase escribir a nadie
el desdichado suceso mío, sino por ver si me era más favorable la suerte en
Argel que en Constantinopla, donde ya había probado mil maneras de huirme,
y ninguna tuvo sazón ni ventura; y pensaba en Argel buscar otros medios de
alcanzar lo que tanto deseaba, porque jamás me desamparó la esperanza de
tener libertad; y cuando en lo que fabricaba, pensaba y ponía por obra no
correspondía el suceso a la intención, luego, sin abandonarme, fingía y
buscaba otra esperanza que me sustentase, aunque fuese débil y flaca.
»Con esto entretenía la vida, encerrado en una prisión o casa que los
turcos llaman baño, donde encierran los cautivos cristianos, así los que
son del rey como de algunos particulares; y los que llaman del almacén, que
es como decir cautivos del concejo, que sirven a la ciudad en las obras
públicas que hace y en otros oficios, y estos tales cautivos tienen muy
dificultosa su libertad, que, como son del común y no tienen amo
particular, no hay con quien tratar su rescate, aunque le tengan. En estos
baños, como tengo dicho, suelen llevar a sus cautivos algunos particulares
del pueblo, principalmente cuando son de rescate, porque allí los tienen
holgados y seguros hasta que venga su rescate. También los cautivos del rey
que son de rescate no salen al trabajo con la demás chusma, si no es cuando
se tarda su rescate; que entonces, por hacerles que escriban por él con más
ahínco, les hacen trabajar y ir por leña con los demás, que es un no
pequeño trabajo.
»Yo, pues, era uno de los de rescate; que, como se supo que era capitán,
puesto que dije mi poca posibilidad y falta de hacienda, no aprovechó nada
para que no me pusiesen en el número de los caballeros y gente de rescate.
Pusiéronme una cadena, más por señal de rescate que por guardarme con ella;
y así, pasaba la vida en aquel baño, con otros muchos caballeros y gente
principal, señalados y tenidos por de rescate. Y, aunque la hambre y
desnudez pudiera fatigarnos a veces, y aun casi siempre, ninguna cosa nos
fatigaba tanto como oír y ver, a cada paso, las jamás vistas ni oídas
crueldades que mi amo usaba con los cristianos. Cada día ahorcaba el suyo,
empalaba a éste, desorejaba aquél; y esto, por tan poca ocasión, y tan sin
ella, que los turcos conocían que lo hacía no más de por hacerlo, y por ser
natural condición suya ser homicida de todo el género humano. Sólo libró
bien con él un soldado español, llamado tal de Saavedra, el cual, con haber
hecho cosas que quedarán en la memoria de aquellas gentes por muchos años,
y todas por alcanzar libertad, jamás le dio palo, ni se lo mandó dar, ni le
dijo mala palabra; y, por la menor cosa de muchas que hizo, temíamos todos
que había de ser empalado, y así lo temió él más de una vez; y si no fuera
porque el tiempo no da lugar, yo dijera ahora algo de lo que este soldado
hizo, que fuera parte para entreteneros y admiraros harto mejor que con el
cuento de mi historia.
»Digo, pues, que encima del patio de nuestra prisión caían las ventanas de
la casa de un moro rico y principal, las cuales, como de ordinario son las
de los moros, más eran agujeros que ventanas, y aun éstas se cubrían con
celosías muy espesas y apretadas. Acaeció, pues, que un día, estando en un
terrado de nuestra prisión con otros tres compañeros, haciendo pruebas de
saltar con las cadenas, por entretener el tiempo, estando solos, porque
todos los demás cristianos habían salido a trabajar, alcé acaso los ojos y
vi que por aquellas cerradas ventanillas que he dicho parecía una caña, y
al remate della puesto un lienzo atado, y la caña se estaba blandeando y
moviéndose, casi como si hiciera señas que llegásemos a tomarla. Miramos en
ello, y uno de los que conmigo estaban fue a ponerse debajo de la caña, por
ver si la soltaban, o lo que hacían; pero, así como llegó, alzaron la caña
y la movieron a los dos lados, como si dijeran no con la cabeza. Volvióse
el cristiano, y tornáronla a bajar y hacer los mesmos movimientos que
primero. Fue otro de mis compañeros, y sucedióle lo mesmo que al primero.
Finalmente, fue el tercero y avínole lo que al primero y al segundo. Viendo
yo esto, no quise dejar de probar la suerte, y, así como llegué a ponerme
debajo de la caña, la dejaron caer, y dio a mis pies dentro del baño. Acudí
luego a desatar el lienzo, en el cual vi un nudo, y dentro dél venían diez
cianíis, que son unas monedas de oro bajo que usan los moros, que cada una
vale diez reales de los nuestros. Si me holgué con el hallazgo, no hay para
qué decirlo, pues fue tanto el contento como la admiración de pensar de
donde podía venirnos aquel bien, especialmente a mí, pues las muestras de
no haber querido soltar la caña sino a mí claro decían que a mí se hacía la
merced. Tomé mi buen dinero, quebré la caña, volvíme al terradillo, miré la
ventana, y vi que por ella salía una muy blanca mano, que la abrían y
cerraban muy apriesa. Con esto entendimos, o imaginamos, que alguna mujer
que en aquella casa vivía nos debía de haber hecho aquel beneficio; y, en
señal de que lo agradecíamos, hecimos zalemas a uso de moros, inclinando la
cabeza, doblando el cuerpo y poniendo los brazos sobre el pecho. De allí a
poco sacaron por la mesma ventana una pequeña cruz hecha de cañas, y luego
la volvieron a entrar. Esta señal nos confirmó en que alguna cristiana
debía de estar cautiva en aquella casa, y era la que el bien nos hacía;
pero la blancura de la mano, y las ajorcas que en ella vimos, nos deshizo
este pensamiento, puesto que imaginamos que debía de ser cristiana
renegada, a quien de ordinario suelen tomar por legítimas mujeres sus
mesmos amos, y aun lo tienen a ventura, porque las estiman en más que las
de su nación.
»En todos nuestros discursos dimos muy lejos de la verdad del caso; y así,
todo nuestro entretenimiento desde allí adelante era mirar y tener por
norte a la ventana donde nos había aparecido la estrella de la caña; pero
bien se pasaron quince días en que no la vimos, ni la mano tampoco, ni otra
señal alguna. Y, aunque en este tiempo procuramos con toda solicitud saber
quién en aquella casa vivía, y si había en ella alguna cristiana renegada,
jamás hubo quien nos dijese otra cosa, sino que allí vivía un moro
principal y rico, llamado Agi Morato, alcaide que había sido de La Pata,
que es oficio entre ellos de mucha calidad. Mas, cuando más descuidados
estábamos de que por allí habían de llover más cianíis, vimos a deshora
parecer la caña, y otro lienzo en ella, con otro nudo más crecido; y esto
fue a tiempo que estaba el baño, como la vez pasada, solo y sin gente.
Hecimos la acostumbrada prueba, yendo cada uno primero que yo, de los
mismos tres que estábamos, pero a ninguno se rindió la caña sino a mí,
porque, en llegando yo, la dejaron caer. Desaté el nudo, y hallé cuarenta
escudos de oro españoles y un papel escrito en arábigo, y al cabo de lo
escrito hecha una grande cruz. Besé la cruz, tomé los escudos, volvíme al
terrado, hecimos todos nuestras zalemas, tornó a parecer la mano, hice
señas que leería el papel, cerraron la ventana. Quedamos todos confusos y
alegres con lo sucedido; y, como ninguno de nosotros no entendía el
arábigo, era grande el deseo que teníamos de entender lo que el papel
contenía, y mayor la dificultad de buscar quien lo leyese.
»En fin, yo me determiné de fiarme de un renegado, natural de Murcia, que
se había dado por grande amigo mío, y puesto prendas entre los dos, que le
obligaban a guardar el secreto que le encargase; porque suelen algunos
renegados, cuando tienen intención de volverse a tierra de cristianos,
traer consigo algunas firmas de cautivos principales, en que dan fe, en la
forma que pueden, como el tal renegado es hombre de bien, y que siempre ha
hecho bien a cristianos, y que lleva deseo de huirse en la primera ocasión
que se le ofrezca. Algunos hay que procuran estas fees con buena intención,
otros se sirven dellas acaso y de industria: que, viniendo a robar a tierra
de cristianos, si a dicha se pierden o los cautivan, sacan sus firmas y
dicen que por aquellos papeles se verá el propósito con que venían, el cual
era de quedarse en tierra de cristianos, y que por eso venían en corso con
los demás turcos. Con esto se escapan de aquel primer ímpetu, y se
reconcilian con la Iglesia, sin que se les haga daño; y, cuando veen la
suya, se vuelven a Berbería a ser lo que antes eran. Otros hay que usan
destos papeles, y los procuran, con buen intento, y se quedan en tierra de
cristianos.
»Pues uno de los renegados que he dicho era este mi amigo, el cual tenía
firmas de todas nuestras camaradas, donde le acreditábamos cuanto era
posible; y si los moros le hallaran estos papeles, le quemaran vivo. Supe
que sabía muy bien arábigo, y no solamente hablarlo, sino escribirlo; pero,
antes que del todo me declarase con él, le dije que me leyese aquel papel,
que acaso me había hallado en un agujero de mi rancho. Abrióle, y estuvo un
buen espacio mirándole y construyéndole, murmurando entre los dientes.
Preguntéle si lo entendía; díjome que muy bien, y, que si quería que me lo
declarase palabra por palabra, que le diese tinta y pluma, porque mejor lo
hiciese. Dímosle luego lo que pedía, y él poco a poco lo fue traduciendo;
y, en acabando, dijo: ''Todo lo que va aquí en romance, sin faltar letra,
es lo que contiene este papel morisco; y hase de advertir que adonde dice
Lela Marién quiere decir Nuestra Señora la Virgen María''.
»Leímos el papel, y decía así:
Cuando yo era niña, tenía mi padre una esclava, la cual en mi lengua me
mostró la zalá cristianesca, y me dijo muchas cosas de Lela Marién. La
cristiana murió, y yo sé que no fue al fuego, sino con Alá, porque después
la vi dos veces, y me dijo que me fuese a tierra de cristianos a ver a Lela
Marién, que me quería mucho. No sé yo cómo vaya: muchos cristianos he visto
por esta ventana, y ninguno me ha parecido caballero sino tú. Yo soy muy
hermosa y muchacha, y tengo muchos dineros que llevar conmigo: mira tú si
puedes hacer cómo nos vamos, y serás allá mi marido, si quisieres, y si no
quisieres, no se me dará nada, que Lela Marién me dará con quien me case.
Yo escribí esto; mira a quién lo das a leer: no te fíes de ningún moro,
porque son todos marfuces. Desto tengo mucha pena: que quisiera que no te
descubrieras a nadie, porque si mi padre lo sabe, me echará luego en un
pozo, y me cubrirá de piedras. En la caña pondré un hilo: ata allí la
respuesta; y si no tienes quien te escriba arábigo, dímelo por señas, que
Lela Marién hará que te entienda. Ella y Alá te guarden, y esa cruz que yo
beso muchas veces; que así me lo mandó la cautiva.
»Mirad, señores, si era razón que las razones deste papel nos admirasen y
alegrasen. Y así, lo uno y lo otro fue de manera que el renegado entendió
que no acaso se había hallado aquel papel, sino que realmente a alguno de
nosotros se había escrito; y así, nos rogó que si era verdad lo que
sospechaba, que nos fiásemos dél y se lo dijésemos, que él aventuraría su
vida por nuestra libertad. Y, diciendo esto, sacó del pecho un crucifijo de
metal, y con muchas lágrimas juró por el Dios que aquella imagen
representaba, en quien él, aunque pecador y malo, bien y fielmente creía,
de guardarnos lealtad y secreto en todo cuanto quisiésemos descubrirle,
porque le parecía, y casi adevinaba que, por medio de aquella que aquel
papel había escrito, había él y todos nosotros de tener libertad, y verse
él en lo que tanto deseaba, que era reducirse al gremio de la Santa
Iglesia, su madre, de quien como miembro podrido estaba dividido y apartado
por su ignorancia y pecado.
»Con tantas lágrimas y con muestras de tanto arrepentimiento dijo esto el
renegado, que todos de un mesmo parecer consentimos, y venimos en
declararle la verdad del caso; y así, le dimos cuenta de todo, sin
encubrirle nada. Mostrámosle la ventanilla por donde parecía la caña, y él
marcó desde allí la casa, y quedó de tener especial y gran cuidado de
informarse quién en ella vivía. Acordamos, ansimesmo, que sería bien
responder al billete de la mora; y, como teníamos quien lo supiese hacer,
luego al momento el renegado escribió las razones que yo le fui notando,
que puntualmente fueron las que diré, porque de todos los puntos
sustanciales que en este suceso me acontecieron, ninguno se me ha ido de la
memoria, ni aun se me irá en tanto que tuviere vida.
»En efeto, lo que a la mora se le respondió fue esto:
El verdadero Alá te guarde, señora mía, y aquella bendita Marién, que es la
verdadera madre de Dios y es la que te ha puesto en corazón que te vayas a
tierra de cristianos, porque te quiere bien. Ruégale tú que se sirva de
darte a entender cómo podrás poner por obra lo que te manda, que ella es
tan buena que sí hará. De mi parte y de la de todos estos cristianos que
están conmigo, te ofrezco de hacer por ti todo lo que pudiéremos, hasta
morir. No dejes de escribirme y avisarme lo que pensares hacer, que yo te
responderé siempre; que el grande Alá nos ha dado un cristiano cautivo que
sabe hablar y escribir tu lengua tan bien como lo verás por este papel. Así
que, sin tener miedo, nos puedes avisar de todo lo que quisieres. A lo que
dices que si fueres a tierra de cristianos, que has de ser mi mujer, yo te
lo prometo como buen cristiano; y sabe que los cristianos cumplen lo que
prometen mejor que los moros. Alá y Marién, su madre, sean en tu guarda,
señora mía.
»Escrito y cerrado este papel, aguardé dos días a que estuviese el baño
solo, como solía, y luego salí al paso acostumbrado del terradillo, por ver
si la caña parecía, que no tardó mucho en asomar. Así como la vi, aunque no
podía ver quién la ponía, mostré el papel, como dando a entender que
pusiesen el hilo, pero ya venía puesto en la caña, al cual até el papel, y
de allí a poco tornó a parecer nuestra estrella, con la blanca bandera de
paz del atadillo. Dejáronla caer, y alcé yo, y hallé en el paño, en toda
suerte de moneda de plata y de oro, más de cincuenta escudos, los cuales
cincuenta veces más doblaron nuestro contento y confirmaron la esperanza de
tener libertad.
»Aquella misma noche volvió nuestro renegado, y nos dijo que había sabido
que en aquella casa vivía el mesmo moro que a nosotros nos habían dicho que
se llamaba Agi Morato, riquísimo por todo estremo, el cual tenía una sola
hija, heredera de toda su hacienda, y que era común opinión en toda la
ciudad ser la más hermosa mujer de la Berbería; y que muchos de los
virreyes que allí venían la habían pedido por mujer, y que ella nunca se
había querido casar; y que también supo que tuvo una cristiana cautiva, que
ya se había muerto; todo lo cual concertaba con lo que venía en el papel.
Entramos luego en consejo con el renegado, en qué orden se tendría para
sacar a la mora y venirnos todos a tierra de cristianos, y, en fin, se
acordó por entonces que esperásemos el aviso segundo de Zoraida, que así se
llamaba la que ahora quiere llamarse María; porque bien vimos que ella, y
no otra alguna era la que había de dar medio a todas aquellas dificultades.
Después que quedamos en esto, dijo el renegado que no tuviésemos pena, que
él perdería la vida o nos pondría en libertad.
»Cuatro días estuvo el baño con gente, que fue ocasión que cuatro días
tardase en parecer la caña; al cabo de los cuales, en la acostumbrada
soledad del baño, pareció con el lienzo tan preñado, que un felicísimo
parto prometía. Inclinóse a mí la caña y el lienzo, hallé en él otro papel
y cien escudos de oro, sin otra moneda alguna. Estaba allí el renegado,
dímosle a leer el papel dentro de nuestro rancho, el cual dijo que así
decía:
Yo no sé, mi señor, cómo dar orden que nos vamos a España, ni Lela Marién
me lo ha dicho, aunque yo se lo he preguntado. Lo que se podrá hacer es que
yo os daré por esta ventana muchísimos dineros de oro: rescataos vos con
ellos y vuestros amigos, y vaya uno en tierra de cristianos, y compre allá
una barca y vuelva por los demás; y a mí me hallarán en el jardín de mi
padre, que está a la puerta de Babazón, junto a la marina, donde tengo de
estar todo este verano con mi padre y con mis criados. De allí, de noche,
me podréis sacar sin miedo y llevarme a la barca; y mira que has de ser mi
marido, porque si no, yo pediré a Marién que te castigue. Si no te fías de
nadie que vaya por la barca, rescátate tú y ve, que yo sé que volverás
mejor que otro, pues eres caballero y cristiano. Procura saber el jardín, y
cuando te pasees por ahí sabré que está solo el baño, y te daré mucho
dinero. Alá te guarde, señor mío.
»Esto decía y contenía el segundo papel. Lo cual visto por todos, cada uno
se ofreció a querer ser el rescatado, y prometió de ir y volver con toda
puntualidad, y también yo me ofrecí a lo mismo; a todo lo cual se opuso el
renegado, diciendo que en ninguna manera consentiría que ninguno saliese de
libertad hasta que fuesen todos juntos, porque la experiencia le había
mostrado cuán mal cumplían los libres las palabras que daban en el
cautiverio; porque muchas veces habían usado de aquel remedio algunos
principales cautivos, rescatando a uno que fuese a Valencia, o Mallorca,
con dineros para poder armar una barca y volver por los que le habían
rescatado, y nunca habían vuelto; porque la libertad alcanzada y el temor
de no volver a perderla les borraba de la memoria todas las obligaciones
del mundo. Y, en confirmación de la verdad que nos decía, nos contó
brevemente un caso que casi en aquella mesma sazón había acaecido a unos
caballeros cristianos, el más estraño que jamás sucedió en aquellas partes,
donde a cada paso suceden cosas de grande espanto y de admiración.
»En efecto, él vino a decir que lo que se podía y debía hacer era que el
dinero que se había de dar para rescatar al cristiano, que se le diese a él
para comprar allí en Argel una barca, con achaque de hacerse mercader y
tratante en Tetuán y en aquella costa; y que, siendo él señor de la barca,
fácilmente se daría traza para sacarlos del baño y embarcarlos a todos.
Cuanto más, que si la mora, como ella decía, daba dineros para rescatarlos
a todos, que, estando libres, era facilísima cosa aun embarcarse en la
mitad del día; y que la dificultad que se ofrecía mayor era que los moros
no consienten que renegado alguno compre ni tenga barca, si no es bajel
grande para ir en corso, porque se temen que el que compra barca,
principalmente si es español, no la quiere sino para irse a tierra de
cristianos; pero que él facilitaría este inconveniente con hacer que un
moro tagarino fuese a la parte con él en la compañía de la barca y en la
ganancia de las mercancías, y con esta sombra él vendría a ser señor de la
barca, con que daba por acabado todo lo demás.
»Y, puesto que a mí y a mis camaradas nos había parecido mejor lo de enviar
por la barca a Mallorca, como la mora decía, no osamos contradecirle,
temerosos que, si no hacíamos lo que él decía, nos había de descubrir y
poner a peligro de perder las vidas, si descubriese el trato de Zoraida,
por cuya vida diéramos todos las nuestras. Y así, determinamos de ponernos
en las manos de Dios y en las del renegado, y en aquel mismo punto se le
respondió a Zoraida, diciéndole que haríamos todo cuanto nos aconsejaba,
porque lo había advertido tan bien como si Lela Marién se lo hubiera dicho,
y que en ella sola estaba dilatar aquel negocio, o ponello luego por obra.
Ofrecímele de nuevo de ser su esposo, y, con esto, otro día que acaeció a
estar solo el baño, en diversas veces, con la caña y el paño, nos dio dos
mil escudos de oro, y un papel donde decía que el primer jumá, que es el
viernes, se iba al jardín de su padre, y que antes que se fuese nos daría
más dinero, y que si aquello no bastase, que se lo avisásemos, que nos
daría cuanto le pidiésemos: que su padre tenía tantos, que no lo echaría
menos, cuanto más, que ella tenía la llaves de todo.
»Dimos luego quinientos escudos al renegado para comprar la barca; con
ochocientos me rescaté yo, dando el dinero a un mercader valenciano que a
la sazón se hallaba en Argel, el cual me rescató del rey, tomándome sobre
su palabra, dándola de que con el primer bajel que viniese de Valencia
pagaría mi rescate; porque si luego diera el dinero, fuera dar sospechas al
rey que había muchos días que mi rescate estaba en Argel, y que el
mercader, por sus granjerías, lo había callado. Finalmente, mi amo era tan
caviloso que en ninguna manera me atreví a que luego se desembolsase el
dinero. El jueves antes del viernes que la hermosa Zoraida se había de ir
al jardín, nos dio otros mil escudos y nos avisó de su partida, rogándome
que, si me rescatase, supiese luego el jardín de su padre, y que en todo
caso buscase ocasión de ir allá y verla. Respondíle en breves palabras que
así lo haría, y que tuviese cuidado de encomendarnos a Lela Marién, con
todas aquellas oraciones que la cautiva le había enseñado.
»Hecho esto, dieron orden en que los tres compañeros nuestros se
rescatasen, por facilitar la salida del baño, y porque, viéndome a mí
rescatado, y a ellos no, pues había dinero, no se alborotasen y les
persuadiese el diablo que hiciesen alguna cosa en perjuicio de Zoraida;
que, puesto que el ser ellos quien eran me podía asegurar deste temor, con
todo eso, no quise poner el negocio en aventura, y así, los hice rescatar
por la misma orden que yo me rescaté, entregando todo el dinero al
mercader, para que, con certeza y seguridad, pudiese hacer la fianza; al
cual nunca descubrimos nuestro trato y secreto, por el peligro que había.
Capítulo XLI. Donde todavía prosigue el cautivo su suceso
»No se pasaron quince días, cuando ya nuestro renegado tenía comprada una
muy buena barca, capaz de más de treinta personas: y, para asegurar su
hecho y dalle color, quiso hacer, como hizo, un viaje a un lugar que se
llamaba Sargel, que está treinta leguas de Argel hacia la parte de Orán, en
el cual hay mucha contratación de higos pasos. Dos o tres veces hizo este
viaje, en compañía del tagarino que había dicho. Tagarinos llaman en
Berbería a los moros de Aragón, y a los de Granada, mudéjares; y en el
reino de Fez llaman a los mudéjares elches, los cuales son la gente de
quien aquel rey más se sirve en la guerra.
»Digo, pues, que cada vez que pasaba con su barca daba fondo en una caleta
que estaba no dos tiros de ballesta del jardín donde Zoraida esperaba; y
allí, muy de propósito, se ponía el renegado con los morillos que bogaban
el remo, o ya a hacer la zalá, o a como por ensayarse de burlas a lo que
pensaba hacer de veras; y así, se iba al jardín de Zoraida y le pedía
fruta, y su padre se la daba sin conocelle; y, aunque él quisiera hablar a
Zoraida, como él después me dijo, y decille que él era el que por orden mía
le había de llevar a tierra de cristianos, que estuviese contenta y segura,
nunca le fue posible, porque las moras no se dejan ver de ningún moro ni
turco, si no es que su marido o su padre se lo manden. De cristianos
cautivos se dejan tratar y comunicar, aun más de aquello que sería
razonable; y a mí me hubiera pesado que él la hubiera hablado, que quizá la
alborotara, viendo que su negocio andaba en boca de renegados. Pero Dios,
que lo ordenaba de otra manera, no dio lugar al buen deseo que nuestro
renegado tenía; el cual, viendo cuán seguramente iba y venía a Sargel, y
que daba fondo cuando y como y adonde quería, y que el tagarino, su
compañero, no tenía más voluntad de lo que la suya ordenaba, y que yo
estaba ya rescatado, y que sólo faltaba buscar algunos cristianos que
bogasen el remo, me dijo que mirase yo cuáles quería traer conmigo, fuera
de los rescatados, y que los tuviese hablados para el primer viernes, donde
tenía determinado que fuese nuestra partida. Viendo esto, hablé a doce
españoles, todos valientes hombres del remo, y de aquellos que más
libremente podían salir de la ciudad; y no fue poco hallar tantos en
aquella coyuntura, porque estaban veinte bajeles en corso, y se habían
llevado toda la gente de remo, y éstos no se hallaran, si no fuera que su
amo se quedó aquel verano sin ir en corso, a acabar una galeota que tenía
en astillero. A los cuales no les dije otra cosa, sino que el primer
viernes en la tarde se saliesen uno a uno, disimuladamente, y se fuesen la
vuelta del jardín de Agi Morato, y que allí me aguardasen hasta que yo
fuese. A cada uno di este aviso de por sí, con orden que, aunque allí
viesen a otros cristianos, no les dijesen sino que yo les había mandado
esperar en aquel lugar.
»Hecha esta diligencia, me faltaba hacer otra, que era la que más me
convenía: y era la de avisar a Zoraida en el punto que estaban los
negocios, para que estuviese apercebida y sobre aviso, que no se
sobresaltase si de improviso la asaltásemos antes del tiempo que ella podía
imaginar que la barca de cristianos podía volver. Y así, determiné de ir al
jardín y ver si podría hablarla; y, con ocasión de coger algunas yerbas, un
día, antes de mi partida, fui allá, y la primera persona con quién encontré
fue con su padre, el cual me dijo, en lengua que en toda la Berbería, y aun
en Costantinopla, se halla entre cautivos y moros, que ni es morisca, ni
castellana, ni de otra nación alguna, sino una mezcla de todas las lenguas
con la cual todos nos entendemos; digo, pues, que en esta manera de
lenguaje me preguntó que qué buscaba en aquel su jardín, y de quién era.
Respondíle que era esclavo de Arnaúte Mamí (y esto, porque sabía yo por muy
cierto que era un grandísimo amigo suyo), y que buscaba de todas yerbas,
para hacer ensalada. Preguntóme, por el consiguiente, si era hombre de
rescate o no, y que cuánto pedía mi amo por mí. Estando en todas estas
preguntas y respuestas, salió de la casa del jardín la bella Zoraida, la
cual ya había mucho que me había visto; y, como las moras en ninguna manera
hacen melindre de mostrarse a los cristianos, ni tampoco se esquivan, como
ya he dicho, no se le dio nada de venir adonde su padre conmigo estaba;
antes, luego cuando su padre vio que venía, y de espacio, la llamó y mandó
que llegase.
»Demasiada cosa sería decir yo agora la mucha hermosura, la gentileza, el
gallardo y rico adorno con que mi querida Zoraida se mostró a mis ojos:
sólo diré que más perlas pendían de su hermosísimo cuello, orejas y
cabellos, que cabellos tenía en la cabeza. En las gargantas de los sus
pies, que descubiertas, a su usanza, traía, traía dos carcajes (que así se
llamaban las manillas o ajorcas de los pies en morisco) de purísimo oro,
con tantos diamantes engastados, que ella me dijo después que su padre los
estimaba en diez mil doblas, y las que traía en las muñecas de las manos
valían otro tanto. Las perlas eran en gran cantidad y muy buenas, porque la
mayor gala y bizarría de las moras es adornarse de ricas perlas y aljófar,
y así, hay más perlas y aljófar entre moros que entre todas las demás
naciones; y el padre de Zoraida tenía fama de tener muchas y de las mejores
que en Argel había, y de tener asimismo más de docientos mil escudos
españoles, de todo lo cual era señora esta que ahora lo es mía. Si con todo
este adorno podía venir entonces hermosa, o no, por las reliquias que le
han quedado en tantos trabajos se podrá conjeturar cuál debía de ser en las
prosperidades. Porque ya se sabe que la hermosura de algunas mujeres tiene
días y sazones, y requiere accidentes para diminuirse o acrecentarse; y es
natural cosa que las pasiones del ánimo la levanten o abajen, puesto que
las más veces la destruyen.
»Digo, en fin, que entonces llegó en todo estremo aderezada y en todo
estremo hermosa, o, a lo menos, a mí me pareció serlo la más que hasta
entonces había visto; y con esto, viendo las obligaciones en que me había
puesto, me parecía que tenía delante de mí una deidad del cielo, venida a
la tierra para mi gusto y para mi remedio. Así como ella llegó, le dijo su
padre en su lengua como yo era cautivo de su amigo Arnaúte Mamí, y que
venía a buscar ensalada. Ella tomó la mano, y en aquella mezcla de lenguas
que tengo dicho me preguntó si era caballero y qué era la causa que no me
rescataba. Yo le respondí que ya estaba rescatado, y que en el precio podía
echar de ver en lo que mi amo me estimaba, pues había dado por mí mil y
quinientos zoltanís. A lo cual ella respondió: ''En verdad que si tú fueras
de mi padre, que yo hiciera que no te diera él por otros dos tantos, porque
vosotros, cristianos, siempre mentís en cuanto decís, y os hacéis pobres
por engañar a los moros''. ''Bien podría ser eso, señora —le respondí—, mas
en verdad que yo la he tratado con mi amo, y la trato y la trataré con
cuantas personas hay en el mundo''. ''Y ¿cuándo te vas?'', dijo Zoraida.
''Mañana, creo yo —dije—, porque está aquí un bajel de Francia que se hace
mañana a la vela, y pienso irme en él''. ''¿No es mejor —replicó Zoraida—,
esperar a que vengan bajeles de España, y irte con ellos, que no con los de
Francia, que no son vuestros amigos?'' ''No —respondí yo—, aunque si como
hay nuevas que viene ya un bajel de España, es verdad, todavía yo le
aguardaré, puesto que es más cierto el partirme mañana; porque el deseo que
tengo de verme en mi tierra, y con las personas que bien quiero, es tanto
que no me dejará esperar otra comodidad, si se tarda, por mejor que sea''.
''Debes de ser, sin duda, casado en tu tierra —dijo Zoraida—, y por eso
deseas ir a verte con tu mujer''. ''No soy —respondí yo— casado, mas tengo
dada la palabra de casarme en llegando allá''. ''Y ¿es hermosa la dama a
quien se la diste?'', dijo Zoraida. ''Tan hermosa es —respondí yo— que para
encarecella y decirte la verdad, te parece a ti mucho''. Desto se riyó muy
de veras su padre, y dijo: ''Gualá, cristiano, que debe de ser muy hermosa
si se parece a mi hija, que es la más hermosa de todo este reino. Si no,
mírala bien, y verás cómo te digo verdad''. Servíanos de intérprete a las
más de estas palabras y razones el padre de Zoraida, como más ladino; que,
aunque ella hablaba la bastarda lengua que, como he dicho, allí se usa, más
declaraba su intención por señas que por palabras.
»Estando en estas y otras muchas razones, llegó un moro corriendo, y dijo,
a grandes voces, que por las bardas o paredes del jardín habían saltado
cuatro turcos, y andaban cogiendo la fruta, aunque no estaba madura.
Sobresaltóse el viejo, y lo mesmo hizo Zoraida, porque es común y casi
natural el miedo que los moros a los turcos tienen, especialmente a los
soldados, los cuales son tan insolentes y tienen tanto imperio sobre los
moros que a ellos están sujetos, que los tratan peor que si fuesen esclavos
suyos. Digo, pues, que dijo su padre a Zoraida: ''Hija, retírate a la casa
y enciérrate, en tanto que yo voy a hablar a estos canes; y tú, cristiano,
busca tus yerbas, y vete en buen hora, y llévete Alá con bien a tu
tierra''. Yo me incliné, y él se fue a buscar los turcos, dejándome solo
con Zoraida, que comenzó a dar muestras de irse donde su padre la había
mandado. Pero, apenas él se encubrió con los árboles del jardín, cuando
ella, volviéndose a mí, llenos los ojos de lágrimas, me dijo: ''Ámexi,
cristiano, ámexi''; que quiere decir: "¿Vaste, cristiano, vaste?" Yo la
respondí: ''Señora, sí, pero no en ninguna manera sin ti: el primero jumá
me aguarda, y no te sobresaltes cuando nos veas; que sin duda alguna iremos
a tierra de cristianos''.
»Yo le dije esto de manera que ella me entendió muy bien a todas las
razones que entrambos pasamos; y, echándome un brazo al cuello, con
desmayados pasos comenzó a caminar hacia la casa; y quiso la suerte, que
pudiera ser muy mala si el cielo no lo ordenara de otra manera, que, yendo
los dos de la manera y postura que os he contado, con un brazo al cuello,
su padre, que ya volvía de hacer ir a los turcos, nos vio de la suerte y
manera que íbamos, y nosotros vimos que él nos había visto; pero Zoraida,
advertida y discreta, no quiso quitar el brazo de mi cuello, antes se llegó
más a mí y puso su cabeza sobre mi pecho, doblando un poco las rodillas,
dando claras señales y muestras que se desmayaba, y yo, ansimismo, di a
entender que la sostenía contra mi voluntad. Su padre llegó corriendo
adonde estábamos, y, viendo a su hija de aquella manera, le preguntó que
qué tenía; pero, como ella no le respondiese, dijo su padre: ''Sin duda
alguna que con el sobresalto de la entrada de estos canes se ha
desmayado''. Y, quitándola del mío, la arrimó a su pecho; y ella, dando un
suspiro y aún no enjutos los ojos de lágrimas, volvió a decir: ''Ámexi,
cristiano, ámexi'': "Vete, cristiano, vete". A lo que su padre respondió:
''No importa, hija, que el cristiano se vaya, que ningún mal te ha hecho, y
los turcos ya son idos. No te sobresalte cosa alguna, pues ninguna hay que
pueda darte pesadumbre, pues, como ya te he dicho, los turcos, a mi ruego,
se volvieron por donde entraron''. ''Ellos, señor, la sobresaltaron, como
has dicho —dije yo a su padre—; mas, pues ella dice que yo me vaya, no la
quiero dar pesadumbre: quédate en paz, y, con tu licencia, volveré, si
fuere menester, por yerbas a este jardín; que, según dice mi amo, en
ninguno las hay mejores para ensalada que en él''. ''Todas las que
quisieres podrás volver —respondió Agi Morato—, que mi hija no dice esto
porque tú ni ninguno de los cristianos la enojaban, sino que, por decir que
los turcos se fuesen, dijo que tú te fueses, o porque ya era hora que
buscases tus yerbas''.
»Con esto, me despedí al punto de entrambos; y ella, arrancándosele el
alma, al parecer, se fue con su padre; y yo, con achaque de buscar las
yerbas, rodeé muy bien y a mi placer todo el jardín: miré bien las entradas
y salidas, y la fortaleza de la casa, y la comodidad que se podía ofrecer
para facilitar todo nuestro negocio. Hecho esto, me vine y di cuenta de
cuanto había pasado al renegado y a mis compañeros; y ya no veía la hora de
verme gozar sin sobresalto del bien que en la hermosa y bella Zoraida la
suerte me ofrecía.
»En fin, el tiempo se pasó, y se llegó el día y plazo de nosotros tan
deseado; y, siguiendo todos el orden y parecer que, con discreta
consideración y largo discurso, muchas veces habíamos dado, tuvimos el buen
suceso que deseábamos; porque el viernes que se siguió al día que yo con
Zoraida hablé en el jardín, nuestro renegado, al anochecer, dio fondo con
la barca casi frontero de donde la hermosísima Zoraida estaba. Ya los
cristianos que habían de bogar el remo estaban prevenidos y escondidos por
diversas partes de todos aquellos alrededores. Todos estaban suspensos y
alborozados, aguardándome, deseosos ya de embestir con el bajel que a los
ojos tenían; porque ellos no sabían el concierto del renegado, sino que
pensaban que a fuerza de brazos habían de haber y ganar la libertad,
quitando la vida a los moros que dentro de la barca estaban.
»Sucedió, pues, que, así como yo me mostré y mis compañeros, todos los
demás escondidos que nos vieron se vinieron llegando a nosotros. Esto era
ya a tiempo que la ciudad estaba ya cerrada, y por toda aquella campaña
ninguna persona parecía. Como estuvimos juntos, dudamos si sería mejor ir
primero por Zoraida, o rendir primero a los moros bagarinos que bogaban el
remo en la barca. Y, estando en esta duda, llegó a nosotros nuestro
renegado diciéndonos que en qué nos deteníamos, que ya era hora, y que
todos sus moros estaban descuidados, y los más dellos durmiendo. Dijímosle
en lo que reparábamos, y él dijo que lo que más importaba era rendir
primero el bajel, que se podía hacer con grandísima facilidad y sin peligro
alguno, y que luego podíamos ir por Zoraida. Pareciónos bien a todos lo que
decía, y así, sin detenernos más, haciendo él la guía, llegamos al bajel,
y, saltando él dentro primero, metió mano a un alfanje, y dijo en morisco:
''Ninguno de vosotros se mueva de aquí, si no quiere que le cueste la
vida''. Ya, a este tiempo, habían entrado dentro casi todos los cristianos.
Los moros, que eran de poco ánimo, viendo hablar de aquella manera a su
arráez, quedáronse espantados, y sin ninguno de todos ellos echar mano a
las armas, que pocas o casi ningunas tenían, se dejaron, sin hablar alguna
palabra, maniatar de los cristianos, los cuales con mucha presteza lo
hicieron, amenazando a los moros que si alzaban por alguna vía o manera la
voz, que luego al punto los pasarían todos a cuchillo.
»Hecho ya esto, quedándose en guardia dellos la mitad de los nuestros, los
que quedábamos, haciéndonos asimismo el renegado la guía, fuimos al jardín
de Agi Morato, y quiso la buena suerte que, llegando a abrir la puerta, se
abrió con tanta facilidad como si cerrada no estuviera; y así, con gran
quietud y silencio, llegamos a la casa sin ser sentidos de nadie. Estaba la
bellísima Zoraida aguardándonos a una ventana, y, así como sintió gente,
preguntó con voz baja si éramos nizarani, como si dijera o preguntara si
éramos cristianos. Yo le respondí que sí, y que bajase. Cuando ella me
conoció, no se detuvo un punto, porque, sin responderme palabra, bajó en un
instante, abrió la puerta y mostróse a todos tan hermosa y ricamente
vestida que no lo acierto a encarecer. Luego que yo la vi, le tomé una
mano y la comencé a besar, y el renegado hizo lo mismo, y mis dos
camaradas; y los demás, que el caso no sabían, hicieron lo que vieron que
nosotros hacíamos, que no parecía sino que le dábamos las gracias y la
reconocíamos por señora de nuestra libertad. El renegado le dijo en lengua
morisca si estaba su padre en el jardín. Ella respondió que sí y que
dormía. ''Pues será menester despertalle —replicó el renegado—, y
llevárnosle con nosotros, y todo aquello que tiene de valor este hermoso
jardín.'' ''No —dijo ella—, a mi padre no se ha de tocar en ningún modo, y
en esta casa no hay otra cosa que lo que yo llevo, que es tanto, que bien
habrá para que todos quedéis ricos y contentos; y esperaros un poco y lo
veréis''. Y, diciendo esto, se volvió a entrar, diciendo que muy presto
volvería; que nos estuviésemos quedos, sin hacer ningún ruido. Preguntéle
al renegado lo que con ella había pasado, el cual me lo contó, a quien yo
dije que en ninguna cosa se había de hacer más de lo que Zoraida quisiese;
la cual ya que volvía cargada con un cofrecillo lleno de escudos de oro,
tantos, que apenas lo podía sustentar, quiso la mala suerte que su padre
despertase en el ínterin y sintiese el ruido que andaba en el jardín; y,
asomándose a la ventana, luego conoció que todos los que en él estaban eran
cristianos; y, dando muchas, grandes y desaforadas voces, comenzó a decir
en arábigo: ''¡Cristianos, cristianos! ¡Ladrones, ladrones!''; por los
cuales gritos nos vimos todos puestos en grandísima y temerosa confusión.
Pero el renegado, viendo el peligro en que estábamos, y lo mucho que le
importaba salir con aquella empresa antes de ser sentido, con grandísima
presteza, subió donde Agi Morato estaba, y juntamente con él fueron algunos
de nosotros; que yo no osé desamparar a la Zoraida, que como desmayada se
había dejado caer en mis brazos. En resolución, los que subieron se dieron
tan buena maña que en un momento bajaron con Agi Morato, trayéndole atadas
las manos y puesto un pañizuelo en la boca, que no le dejaba hablar
palabra, amenazándole que el hablarla le había de costar la vida. Cuando su
hija le vio, se cubrió los ojos por no verle, y su padre quedó espantado,
ignorando cuán de su voluntad se había puesto en nuestras manos. Mas,
entonces siendo más necesarios los pies, con diligencia y presteza nos
pusimos en la barca; que ya los que en ella habían quedado nos esperaban,
temerosos de algún mal suceso nuestro.
»Apenas serían dos horas pasadas de la noche, cuando ya estábamos todos en
la barca, en la cual se le quitó al padre de Zoraida la atadura de las
manos y el paño de la boca; pero tornóle a decir el renegado que no hablase
palabra, que le quitarían la vida. Él, como vio allí a su hija, comenzó a
suspirar ternísimamente, y más cuando vio que yo estrechamente la tenía
abrazada, y que ella sin defender, quejarse ni esquivarse, se estaba queda;
pero, con todo esto, callaba, porque no pusiesen en efeto las muchas
amenazas que el renegado le hacía. Viéndose, pues, Zoraida ya en la barca,
y que queríamos dar los remos al agua, y viendo allí a su padre y a los
demás moros que atados estaban, le dijo al renegado que me dijese le
hiciese merced de soltar a aquellos moros y de dar libertad a su padre,
porque antes se arrojaría en la mar que ver delante de sus ojos y por causa
suya llevar cautivo a un padre que tanto la había querido. El renegado me
lo dijo; y yo respondí que era muy contento; pero él respondió que no
convenía, a causa que, si allí los dejaban apellidarían luego la tierra y
alborotarían la ciudad, y serían causa que saliesen a buscallos con algunas
fragatas ligeras, y les tomasen la tierra y la mar, de manera que no
pudiésemos escaparnos; que lo que se podría hacer era darles libertad en
llegando a la primera tierra de cristianos. En este parecer venimos todos,
y Zoraida, a quien se le dio cuenta, con las causas que nos movían a no
hacer luego lo que quería, también se satisfizo; y luego, con regocijado
silencio y alegre diligencia, cada uno de nuestros valientes remeros tomó
su remo, y comenzamos, encomendándonos a Dios de todo corazón, a navegar la
vuelta de las islas de Mallorca, que es la tierra de cristianos más cerca.
»Pero, a causa de soplar un poco el viento tramontana y estar la mar algo
picada, no fue posible seguir la derrota de Mallorca, y fuenos forzoso
dejarnos ir tierra a tierra la vuelta de Orán, no sin mucha pesadumbre
nuestra, por no ser descubiertos del lugar de Sargel, que en aquella costa
cae sesenta millas de Argel. Y, asimismo, temíamos encontrar por aquel
paraje alguna galeota de las que de ordinario vienen con mercancía de
Tetuán, aunque cada uno por sí, y todos juntos, presumíamos de que, si se
encontraba galeota de mercancía, como no fuese de las que andan en corso,
que no sólo no nos perderíamos, mas que tomaríamos bajel donde con más
seguridad pudiésemos acabar nuestro viaje. Iba Zoraida, en tanto que se
navegaba, puesta la cabeza entre mis manos, por no ver a su padre, y sentía
yo que iba llamando a Lela Marién que nos ayudase.
»Bien habríamos navegado treinta millas, cuando nos amaneció, como tres
tiros de arcabuz desviados de tierra, toda la cual vimos desierta y sin
nadie que nos descubriese; pero, con todo eso, nos fuimos a fuerza de
brazos entrando un poco en la mar, que ya estaba algo más sosegada; y,
habiendo entrado casi dos leguas, diose orden que se bogase a cuarteles en
tanto que comíamos algo, que iba bien proveída la barca, puesto que los que
bogaban dijeron que no era aquél tiempo de tomar reposo alguno, que les
diesen de comer los que no bogaban, que ellos no querían soltar los remos
de las manos en manera alguna. Hízose ansí, y en esto comenzó a soplar un
viento largo, que nos obligó a hacer luego vela y a dejar el remo, y
enderezar a Orán, por no ser posible poder hacer otro viaje. Todo se hizo
con muchísima presteza; y así, a la vela, navegamos por más de ocho millas
por hora, sin llevar otro temor alguno sino el de encontrar con bajel que
de corso fuese.
»Dimos de comer a los moros bagarinos, y el renegado les consoló
diciéndoles como no iban cautivos, que en la primera ocasión les darían
libertad. Lo mismo se le dijo al padre de Zoraida, el cual respondió:
''Cualquiera otra cosa pudiera yo esperar y creer de vuestra liberalidad y
buen término, ¡oh cristianos!, mas el darme libertad, no me tengáis por tan
simple que lo imagine; que nunca os pusistes vosotros al peligro de
quitármela para volverla tan liberalmente, especialmente sabiendo quién soy
yo, y el interese que se os puede seguir de dármela; el cual interese, si
le queréis poner nombre, desde aquí os ofrezco todo aquello que quisiéredes
por mí y por esa desdichada hija mía, o si no, por ella sola, que es la
mayor y la mejor parte de mi alma''. En diciendo esto, comenzó a llorar tan
amargamente que a todos nos movió a compasión, y forzó a Zoraida que le
mirase; la cual, viéndole llorar, así se enterneció que se levantó de mis
pies y fue a abrazar a su padre, y, juntando su rostro con el suyo,
comenzaron los dos tan tierno llanto que muchos de los que allí íbamos le
acompañamos en él. Pero, cuando su padre la vio adornada de fiesta y con
tantas joyas sobre sí, le dijo en su lengua: ''¿Qué es esto, hija, que ayer
al anochecer, antes que nos sucediese esta terrible desgracia en que nos
vemos, te vi con tus ordinarios y caseros vestidos, y agora, sin que hayas
tenido tiempo de vestirte y sin haberte dado alguna nueva alegre de
solenizalle con adornarte y pulirte, te veo compuesta con los mejores
vestidos que yo supe y pude darte cuando nos fue la ventura más favorable?
Respóndeme a esto, que me tiene más suspenso y admirado que la misma
desgracia en que me hallo''.
»Todo lo que el moro decía a su hija nos lo declaraba el renegado, y ella
no le respondía palabra. Pero, cuando él vio a un lado de la barca el
cofrecillo donde ella solía tener sus joyas, el cual sabía él bien que le
había dejado en Argel, y no traídole al jardín, quedó más confuso, y
preguntóle que cómo aquel cofre había venido a nuestras manos, y qué era lo
que venía dentro. A lo cual el renegado, sin aguardar que Zoraida le
respondiese, le respondió: ''No te canses, señor, en preguntar a Zoraida,
tu hija, tantas cosas, porque con una que yo te responda te satisfaré a
todas; y así, quiero que sepas que ella es cristiana, y es la que ha sido
la lima de nuestras cadenas y la libertad de nuestro cautiverio; ella va
aquí de su voluntad, tan contenta, a lo que yo imagino, de verse en este
estado, como el que sale de las tinieblas a la luz, de la muerte a la vida
y de la pena a la gloria''. ''¿Es verdad lo que éste dice, hija?'', dijo el
moro. ''Así es'', respondió Zoraida. ''¿Que, en efeto —replicó el viejo—,
tú eres cristiana, y la que ha puesto a su padre en poder de sus
enemigos?'' A lo cual respondió Zoraida: ''La que es cristiana yo soy, pero
no la que te ha puesto en este punto, porque nunca mi deseo se estendió a
dejarte ni a hacerte mal, sino a hacerme a mí bien''. ''Y ¿qué bien es el
que te has hecho, hija?'' ''Eso —respondió ella— pregúntaselo tú a Lela
Marién, que ella te lo sabrá decir mejor que no yo''.
»Apenas hubo oído esto el moro, cuando, con una increíble presteza, se
arrojó de cabeza en la mar, donde sin ninguna duda se ahogara, si el
vestido largo y embarazoso que traía no le entretuviera un poco sobre el
agua. Dio voces Zoraida que le sacasen, y así, acudimos luego todos, y,
asiéndole de la almalafa, le sacamos medio ahogado y sin sentido, de que
recibió tanta pena Zoraida que, como si fuera ya muerto, hacía sobre él un
tierno y doloroso llanto. Volvímosle boca abajo, volvió mucha agua, tornó
en sí al cabo de dos horas, en las cuales, habiéndose trocado el viento,
nos convino volver hacia tierra, y hacer fuerza de remos, por no embestir
en ella; mas quiso nuestra buena suerte que llegamos a una cala que se hace
al lado de un pequeño promontorio o cabo que de los moros es llamado el de
La Cava Rumía, que en nuestra lengua quiere decir La mala mujer cristiana;
y es tradición entre los moros que en aquel lugar está enterrada la Cava,
por quien se perdió España, porque cava en su lengua quiere decir mujer
mala, y rumía, cristiana; y aun tienen por mal agüero llegar allí a dar
fondo cuando la necesidad les fuerza a ello, porque nunca le dan sin ella;
puesto que para nosotros no fue abrigo de mala mujer, sino puerto seguro de
nuestro remedio, según andaba alterada la mar.
»Pusimos nuestras centinelas en tierra, y no dejamos jamás los remos de la
mano; comimos de lo que el renegado había proveído, y rogamos a Dios y a
Nuestra Señora, de todo nuestro corazón, que nos ayudase y favoreciese para
que felicemente diésemos fin a tan dichoso principio. Diose orden, a
suplicación de Zoraida, como echásemos en tierra a su padre y a todos los
demás moros que allí atados venían, porque no le bastaba el ánimo, ni lo
podían sufrir sus blandas entrañas, ver delante de sus ojos atado a su
padre y aquellos de su tierra presos. Prometímosle de hacerlo así al tiempo
de la partida, pues no corría peligro el dejallos en aquel lugar, que era
despoblado. No fueron tan vanas nuestras oraciones que no fuesen oídas del
cielo; que, en nuestro favor, luego volvió el viento, tranquilo el mar,
convidándonos a que tornásemos alegres a proseguir nuestro comenzado viaje.
»Viendo esto, desatamos a los moros, y uno a uno los pusimos en tierra, de
lo que ellos se quedaron admirados; pero, llegando a desembarcar al padre
de Zoraida, que ya estaba en todo su acuerdo, dijo: ''¿Por qué pensáis,
cristianos, que esta mala hembra huelga de que me deis libertad? ¿Pensáis
que es por piedad que de mí tiene? No, por cierto, sino que lo hace por el
estorbo que le dará mi presencia cuando quiera poner en ejecución sus malos
deseos; ni penséis que la ha movido a mudar religión entender ella que la
vuestra a la nuestra se aventaja, sino el saber que en vuestra tierra se
usa la deshonestidad más libremente que en la nuestra''. Y, volviéndose a
Zoraida, teniéndole yo y otro cristiano de entrambos brazos asido, porque
algún desatino no hiciese, le dijo: ''¡Oh infame moza y mal aconsejada
muchacha! ¿Adónde vas, ciega y desatinada, en poder destos perros,
naturales enemigos nuestros? ¡Maldita sea la hora en que yo te engendré, y
malditos sean los regalos y deleites en que te he criado!'' Pero, viendo yo
que llevaba término de no acabar tan presto, di priesa a ponelle en tierra,
y desde allí, a voces, prosiguió en sus maldiciones y lamentos, rogando a
Mahoma rogase a Alá que nos destruyese, confundiese y acabase; y cuando,
por habernos hecho a la vela, no podimos oír sus palabras, vimos sus obras,
que eran arrancarse las barbas, mesarse los cabellos y arrastrarse por el
suelo; mas una vez esforzó la voz de tal manera que podimos entender que
decía: ''¡Vuelve, amada hija, vuelve a tierra, que todo te lo perdono;
entrega a esos hombres ese dinero, que ya es suyo, y vuelve a consolar a
este triste padre tuyo, que en esta desierta arena dejará la vida, si tú le
dejas!'' Todo lo cual escuchaba Zoraida, y todo lo sentía y lloraba, y no
supo decirle ni respondelle palabra, sino: ''Plega a Alá, padre mío, que
Lela Marién, que ha sido la causa de que yo sea cristiana, ella te consuele
en tu tristeza. Alá sabe bien que no pude hacer otra cosa de la que he
hecho, y que estos cristianos no deben nada a mi voluntad, pues, aunque
quisiera no venir con ellos y quedarme en mi casa, me fuera imposible,
según la priesa que me daba mi alma a poner por obra ésta que a mí me
parece tan buena como tú, padre amado, la juzgas por mala''. Esto dijo, a
tiempo que ni su padre la oía, ni nosotros ya le veíamos; y así, consolando
yo a Zoraida, atendimos todos a nuestro viaje, el cual nos le facilitaba el
proprio viento, de tal manera que bien tuvimos por cierto de vernos otro
día al amanecer en las riberas de España.
»Mas, como pocas veces, o nunca, viene el bien puro y sencillo, sin ser
acompañado o seguido de algún mal que le turbe o sobresalte, quiso nuestra
ventura, o quizá las maldiciones que el moro a su hija había echado, que
siempre se han de temer de cualquier padre que sean; quiso, digo, que
estando ya engolfados y siendo ya casi pasadas tres horas de la noche,
yendo con la vela tendida de alto baja, frenillados los remos, porque el
próspero viento nos quitaba del trabajo de haberlos menester, con la luz de
la luna, que claramente resplandecía, vimos cerca de nosotros un bajel
redondo, que, con todas las velas tendidas, llevando un poco a orza el
timón, delante de nosotros atravesaba; y esto tan cerca, que nos fue
forzoso amainar por no embestirle, y ellos, asimesmo, hicieron fuerza de
timón para darnos lugar que pasásemos.
»Habíanse puesto a bordo del bajel a preguntarnos quién éramos, y adónde
navegábamos, y de dónde veníamos; pero, por preguntarnos esto en lengua
francesa, dijo nuestro renegado: ''Ninguno responda; porque éstos, sin
duda, son cosarios franceses, que hacen a toda ropa''. Por este
advertimiento, ninguno respondió palabra; y, habiendo pasado un poco
delante, que ya el bajel quedaba sotavento, de improviso soltaron dos
piezas de artillería, y, a lo que parecía, ambas venían con cadenas, porque
con una cortaron nuestro árbol por medio, y dieron con él y con la vela en
la mar; y al momento, disparando otra pieza, vino a dar la bala en mitad de
nuestra barca, de modo que la abrió toda, sin hacer otro mal alguno; pero,
como nosotros nos vimos ir a fondo, comenzamos todos a grandes voces a
pedir socorro y a rogar a los del bajel que nos acogiesen, porque nos
anegábamos. Amainaron entonces, y, echando el esquife o barca a la mar,
entraron en él hasta doce franceses bien armados, con sus arcabuces y
cuerdas encendidas, y así llegaron junto al nuestro; y, viendo cuán pocos
éramos y cómo el bajel se hundía, nos recogieron, diciendo que, por haber
usado de la descortesía de no respondelles, nos había sucedido aquello.
Nuestro renegado tomó el cofre de las riquezas de Zoraida, y dio con él en
la mar, sin que ninguno echase de ver en lo que hacía. En resolución, todos
pasamos con los franceses, los cuales, después de haberse informado de todo
aquello que de nosotros saber quisieron, como si fueran nuestros capitales
enemigos, nos despojaron de todo cuanto teníamos, y a Zoraida le quitaron
hasta los carcajes que traía en los pies. Pero no me daba a mí tanta
pesadumbre la que a Zoraida daban, como me la daba el temor que tenía de
que habían de pasar del quitar de las riquísimas y preciosísimas joyas al
quitar de la joya que más valía y ella más estimaba. Pero los deseos de
aquella gente no se estienden a más que al dinero, y desto jamás se vee
harta su codicia; lo cual entonces llegó a tanto, que aun hasta los
vestidos de cautivos nos quitaran si de algún provecho les fueran. Y hubo
parecer entre ellos de que a todos nos arrojasen a la mar envueltos en una
vela, porque tenían intención de tratar en algunos puertos de España con
nombre de que eran bretones, y si nos llevaban vivos, serían castigados,
siendo descubierto su hurto. Mas el capitán, que era el que había despojado
a mi querida Zoraida, dijo que él se contentaba con la presa que tenía, y
que no quería tocar en ningún puerto de España, sino pasar el estrecho de
Gibraltar de noche, o como pudiese, y irse a la Rochela, de donde había
salido; y así, tomaron por acuerdo de darnos el esquife de su navío, y todo
lo necesario para la corta navegación que nos quedaba, como lo hicieron
otra día, ya a vista de tierra de España, con la cual vista, todas nuestras
pesadumbres y pobrezas se nos olvidaron de todo punto, como si no hubieran
pasado por nosotros: tanto es el gusto de alcanzar la libertad perdida.
»Cerca de mediodía podría ser cuando nos echaron en la barca, dándonos dos
barriles de agua y algún bizcocho; y el capitán, movido no sé de qué
misericordia, al embarcarse la hermosísima Zoraida, le dio hasta cuarenta
escudos de oro, y no consintió que le quitasen sus soldados estos mesmos
vestidos que ahora tiene puestos. Entramos en el bajel; dímosles las
gracias por el bien que nos hacían, mostrándonos más agradecidos que
quejosos; ellos se hicieron a lo largo, siguiendo la derrota del estrecho;
nosotros, sin mirar a otro norte que a la tierra que se nos mostraba
delante, nos dimos tanta priesa a bogar que al poner del sol estábamos tan
cerca que bien pudiéramos, a nuestro parecer, llegar antes que fuera muy
noche; pero, por no parecer en aquella noche la luna y el cielo mostrarse
escuro, y por ignorar el paraje en que estábamos, no nos pareció cosa
segura embestir en tierra, como a muchos de nosotros les parecía, diciendo
que diésemos en ella, aunque fuese en unas peñas y lejos de poblado, porque
así aseguraríamos el temor que de razón se debía tener que por allí
anduviesen bajeles de cosarios de Tetuán, los cuales anochecen en Berbería
y amanecen en las costas de España, y hacen de ordinario presa, y se
vuelven a dormir a sus casas. Pero, de los contrarios pareceres, el que se
tomó fue que nos llegásemos poco a poco, y que si el sosiego del mar lo
concediese, desembarcásemos donde pudiésemos.
»Hízose así, y poco antes de la media noche sería cuando llegamos al pie de
una disformísima y alta montaña, no tan junto al mar que no concediese un
poco de espacio para poder desembarcar cómodamente. Embestimos en la arena,
salimos a tierra, besamos el suelo, y, con lágrimas de muy alegrísimo
contento, dimos todos gracias a Dios, Señor Nuestro, por el bien tan
incomparable que nos había hecho. Sacamos de la barca los bastimentos que
tenía, tirámosla en tierra, y subímonos un grandísimo trecho en la montaña,
porque aún allí estábamos, y aún no podíamos asegurar el pecho, ni
acabábamos de creer que era tierra de cristianos la que ya nos sostenía.
Amaneció más tarde, a mi parecer, de lo que quisiéramos. Acabamos de
subir toda la montaña, por ver si desde allí algún poblado se descubría, o
algunas cabañas de pastores; pero, aunque más tendimos la vista, ni
poblado, ni persona, ni senda, ni camino descubrimos. Con todo esto,
determinamos de entrarnos la tierra adentro, pues no podría ser menos sino
que presto descubriésemos quien nos diese noticia della. Pero lo que a mí
más me fatigaba era el ver ir a pie a Zoraida por aquellas asperezas, que,
puesto que alguna vez la puse sobre mis hombros, más le cansaba a ella mi
cansancio que la reposaba su reposo; y así, nunca más quiso que yo aquel
trabajo tomase; y, con mucha paciencia y muestras de alegría, llevándola yo
siempre de la mano, poco menos de un cuarto de legua debíamos de haber
andado, cuando llegó a nuestros oídos el son de una pequeña esquila, señal
clara que por allí cerca había ganado; y, mirando todos con atención si
alguno se parecía, vimos al pie de un alcornoque un pastor mozo, que con
grande reposo y descuido estaba labrando un palo con un cuchillo. Dimos
voces, y él, alzando la cabeza, se puso ligeramente en pie, y, a lo que
después supimos, los primeros que a la vista se le ofrecieron fueron el
renegado y Zoraida, y, como él los vio en hábito de moros, pensó que todos
los de la Berbería estaban sobre él; y, metiéndose con estraña ligereza por
el bosque adelante, comenzó a dar los mayores gritos del mundo diciendo:
''¡Moros, moros hay en la tierra! ¡Moros, moros! ¡Arma, arma!''
»Con estas voces quedamos todos confusos, y no sabíamos qué hacernos; pero,
considerando que las voces del pastor habían de alborotar la tierra, y que
la caballería de la costa había de venir luego a ver lo que era, acordamos
que el renegado se desnudase las ropas del turco y se vistiese un
gilecuelco o casaca de cautivo que uno de nosotros le dio luego, aunque se
quedó en camisa; y así, encomendándonos a Dios, fuimos por el mismo camino
que vimos que el pastor llevaba, esperando siempre cuándo había de dar
sobre nosotros la caballería de la costa. Y no nos engañó nuestro
pensamiento, porque, aún no habrían pasado dos horas cuando, habiendo ya
salido de aquellas malezas a un llano, descubrimos hasta cincuenta
caballeros, que con gran ligereza, corriendo a media rienda, a nosotros se
venían, y así como los vimos, nos estuvimos quedos aguardándolos; pero,
como ellos llegaron y vieron, en lugar de los moros que buscaban, tanto
pobre cristiano, quedaron confusos, y uno dellos nos preguntó si éramos
nosotros acaso la ocasión por que un pastor había apellidado al arma.
''Sí'', dije yo; y, queriendo comenzar a decirle mi suceso, y de dónde
veníamos y quién éramos, uno de los cristianos que con nosotros venían
conoció al jinete que nos había hecho la pregunta, y dijo, sin dejarme a mí
decir más palabra: ''¡Gracias sean dadas a Dios, señores, que a tan buena
parte nos ha conducido!, porque, si yo no me engaño, la tierra que pisamos
es la de Vélez Málaga, si ya los años de mi cautiverio no me han quitado de
la memoria el acordarme que vos, señor, que nos preguntáis quién somos,
sois Pedro de Bustamante, tío mío''. Apenas hubo dicho esto el cristiano
cautivo, cuando el jinete se arrojó del caballo y vino a abrazar al mozo,
diciéndole: ''Sobrino de mi alma y de mi vida, ya te conozco, y ya te he
llorado por muerto yo, y mi hermana, tu madre, y todos los tuyos, que aún
viven; y Dios ha sido servido de darles vida para que gocen el placer de
verte: ya sabíamos que estabas en Argel, y por las señales y muestras de
tus vestidos, y la de todos los desta compañía, comprehendo que habéis
tenido milagrosa libertad''. ''Así es —respondió el mozo—, y tiempo nos
quedará para contároslo todo''.
»Luego que los jinetes entendieron que éramos cristianos cautivos, se
apearon de sus caballos, y cada uno nos convidaba con el suyo para
llevarnos a la ciudad de Vélez Málaga, que legua y media de allí estaba.
Algunos dellos volvieron a llevar la barca a la ciudad, diciéndoles dónde
la habíamos dejado; otros nos subieron a las ancas, y Zoraida fue en las
del caballo del tío del cristiano. Saliónos a recebir todo el pueblo, que
ya de alguno que se había adelantado sabían la nueva de nuestra venida. No
se admiraban de ver cautivos libres, ni moros cautivos, porque toda la
gente de aquella costa está hecha a ver a los unos y a los otros; pero
admirábanse de la hermosura de Zoraida, la cual en aquel instante y sazón
estaba en su punto, ansí con el cansancio del camino como con la alegría de
verse ya en tierra de cristianos, sin sobresalto de perderse; y esto le
había sacado al rostro tales colores que, si no es que la afición entonces
me engañaba, osaré decir que más hermosa criatura no había en el mundo; a
lo menos, que yo la hubiese visto.
»Fuimos derechos a la iglesia, a dar gracias a Dios por la merced recebida;
y, así como en ella entró Zoraida, dijo que allí había rostros que se
parecían a los de Lela Marién. Dijímosle que eran imágines suyas, y como
mejor se pudo le dio el renegado a entender lo que significaban, para que
ella las adorase como si verdaderamente fueran cada una dellas la misma
Lela Marién que la había hablado. Ella, que tiene buen entendimiento y un
natural fácil y claro, entendió luego cuanto acerca de las imágenes se le
dijo. Desde allí nos llevaron y repartieron a todos en diferentes casas del
pueblo; pero al renegado, Zoraida y a mí nos llevó el cristiano que vino
con nosotros, y en casa de sus padres, que medianamente eran acomodados de
los bienes de fortuna, y nos regalaron con tanto amor como a su mismo hijo.
»Seis días estuvimos en Vélez, al cabo de los cuales el renegado, hecha su
información de cuanto le convenía, se fue a la ciudad de Granada, a
reducirse por medio de la Santa Inquisición al gremio santísimo de la
Iglesia; los demás cristianos libertados se fueron cada uno donde mejor le
pareció; solos quedamos Zoraida y yo, con solos los escudos que la cortesía
del francés le dio a Zoraida, de los cuales compré este animal en que ella
viene; y, sirviéndola yo hasta agora de padre y escudero, y no de esposo,
vamos con intención de ver si mi padre es vivo, o si alguno de mis hermanos
ha tenido más próspera ventura que la mía, puesto que, por haberme hecho el
cielo compañero de Zoraida, me parece que ninguna otra suerte me pudiera
venir, por buena que fuera, que más la estimara. La paciencia con que
Zoraida lleva las incomodidades que la pobreza trae consigo, y el deseo que
muestra tener de verse ya cristiana es tanto y tal, que me admira y me
mueve a servirla todo el tiempo de mi vida, puesto que el gusto que tengo
de verme suyo y de que ella sea mía me lo turba y deshace no saber si
hallaré en mi tierra algún rincón donde recogella, y si habrán hecho el
tiempo y la muerte tal mudanza en la hacienda y vida de mi padre y hermanos
que apenas halle quien me conozca, si ellos faltan.» No tengo más, señores,
que deciros de mi historia; la cual, si es agradable y peregrina, júzguenlo
vuestros buenos entendimientos; que de mí sé decir que quisiera habérosla
contado más brevemente, puesto que el temor de enfadaros más de cuatro
circustancias me ha quitado de la lengua.
Capítulo XLII. Que trata de lo que más sucedió en la venta y de otras
muchas cosas dignas de saberse
Calló, en diciendo esto, el cautivo, a quien don Fernando dijo:
— Por cierto, señor capitán, el modo con que habéis contado este estraño
suceso ha sido tal, que iguala a la novedad y estrañeza del mesmo caso.
Todo es peregrino y raro, y lleno de accidentes que maravillan y suspenden
a quien los oye; y es de tal manera el gusto que hemos recebido en
escuchalle, que, aunque nos hallara el día de mañana entretenidos en el
mesmo cuento, holgáramos que de nuevo se comenzara.
Y, en diciendo esto, don Fernando y todos los demás se le ofrecieron, con
todo lo a ellos posible para servirle, con palabras y razones tan amorosas
y tan verdaderas que el capitán se tuvo por bien satisfecho de sus
voluntades. Especialmente, le ofreció don Fernando que si quería volverse
con él, que él haría que el marqués, su hermano, fuese padrino del bautismo
de Zoraida, y que él, por su parte, le acomodaría de manera que pudiese
entrar en su tierra con el autoridad y cómodo que a su persona se debía.
Todo lo agradeció cortesísimamente el cautivo, pero no quiso acetar ninguno
de sus liberales ofrecimientos.
En esto, llegaba ya la noche, y, al cerrar della, llegó a la venta un
coche, con algunos hombres de a caballo. Pidieron posada; a quien la
ventera respondió que no había en toda la venta un palmo desocupado.
— Pues, aunque eso sea —dijo uno de los de a caballo que habían entrado—, no
ha de faltar para el señor oidor que aquí viene.
A este nombre se turbó la güéspeda, y dijo:
— Señor, lo que en ello hay es que no tengo camas: si es que su merced del
señor oidor la trae, que sí debe de traer, entre en buen hora, que yo y mi
marido nos saldremos de nuestro aposento por acomodar a su merced.
— Sea en buen hora —dijo el escudero.
Pero, a este tiempo, ya había salido del coche un hombre, que en el traje
mostró luego el oficio y cargo que tenía, porque la ropa luenga, con las
mangas arrocadas, que vestía, mostraron ser oidor, como su criado había
dicho. Traía de la mano a una doncella, al parecer de hasta diez y seis
años, vestida de camino, tan bizarra, tan hermosa y tan gallarda que a
todos puso en admiración su vista; de suerte que, a no haber visto a
Dorotea y a Luscinda y Zoraida, que en la venta estaban, creyeran que otra
tal hermosura como la desta doncella difícilmente pudiera hallarse. Hallóse
don Quijote al entrar del oidor y de la doncella, y, así como le vio, dijo:
— Seguramente puede vuestra merced entrar y espaciarse en este castillo,
que, aunque es estrecho y mal acomodado, no hay estrecheza ni incomodidad
en el mundo que no dé lugar a las armas y a las letras, y más si las armas
y letras traen por guía y adalid a la fermosura, como la traen las letras
de vuestra merced en esta fermosa doncella, a quien deben no sólo abrirse y
manifestarse los castillos, sino apartarse los riscos, y devidirse y
abajarse las montañas, para dalle acogida. Entre vuestra merced, digo, en
este paraíso, que aquí hallará estrellas y soles que acompañen el cielo que
vuestra merced trae consigo; aquí hallará las armas en su punto y la
hermosura en su estremo.
Admirado quedó el oidor del razonamiento de don Quijote, a quien se puso a
mirar muy de propósito, y no menos le admiraba su talle que sus palabras;
y, sin hallar ningunas con que respondelle, se tornó a admirar de nuevo
cuando vio delante de sí a Luscinda, Dorotea y a Zoraida, que, a las nuevas
de los nuevos güéspedes y a las que la ventera les había dado de la
hermosura de la doncella, habían venido a verla y a recebirla. Pero don
Fernando, Cardenio y el cura le hicieron más llanos y más cortesanos
ofrecimientos. En efecto, el señor oidor entró confuso, así de lo que veía
como de lo que escuchaba, y las hermosas de la venta dieron la bienllegada
a la hermosa doncella.
En resolución, bien echó de ver el oidor que era gente principal toda la
que allí estaba; pero el talle, visaje y la apostura de don Quijote le
desatinaba; y, habiendo pasado entre todos corteses ofrecimientos y
tanteado la comodidad de la venta, se ordenó lo que antes estaba ordenado:
que todas las mujeres se entrasen en el camaranchón ya referido, y que los
hombres se quedasen fuera, como en su guarda. Y así, fue contento el oidor
que su hija, que era la doncella, se fuese con aquellas señoras, lo que
ella hizo de muy buena gana. Y con parte de la estrecha cama del ventero, y
con la mitad de la que el oidor traía, se acomodaron aquella noche mejor de
lo que pensaban.
El cautivo, que, desde el punto que vio al oidor, le dio saltos el corazón
y barruntos de que aquél era su hermano, preguntó a uno de los criados que
con él venían que cómo se llamaba y si sabía de qué tierra era. El criado
le respondió que se llamaba el licenciado Juan Pérez de Viedma, y que había
oído decir que era de un lugar de las montañas de León. Con esta relación y
con lo que él había visto se acabó de confirmar de que aquél era su
hermano, que había seguido las letras por consejo de su padre; y,
alborotado y contento, llamando aparte a don Fernando, a Cardenio y al
cura, les contó lo que pasaba, certificándoles que aquel oidor era su
hermano. Habíale dicho también el criado como iba proveído por oidor a las
Indias, en la Audiencia de Méjico. Supo también como aquella doncella era
su hija, de cuyo parto había muerto su madre, y que él había quedado muy
rico con el dote que con la hija se le quedó en casa. Pidióles consejo qué
modo tendría para descubrirse, o para conocer primero si, después de
descubierto, su hermano, por verle pobre, se afrentaba o le recebía con
buenas entrañas.
— Déjeseme a mí el hacer esa experiencia —dijo el cura—; cuanto más, que no
hay pensar sino que vos, señor capitán, seréis muy bien recebido; porque el
valor y prudencia que en su buen parecer descubre vuestro hermano no da
indicios de ser arrogante ni desconocido, ni que no ha de saber poner los
casos de la fortuna en su punto.
— Con todo eso —dijo el capitán— yo querría, no de improviso, sino por
rodeos, dármele a conocer.
— Ya os digo —respondió el cura— que yo lo trazaré de modo que todos
quedemos satisfechos.
Ya, en esto, estaba aderezada la cena, y todos se sentaron a la mesa, eceto
el cautivo y las señoras, que cenaron de por sí en su aposento. En la mitad
de la cena dijo el cura:
— Del mesmo nombre de vuestra merced, señor oidor, tuve yo una camarada en
Costantinopla, donde estuve cautivo algunos años; la cual camarada era uno
de los valientes soldados y capitanes que había en toda la infantería
española, pero tanto cuanto tenía de esforzado y valeroso lo tenía de
desdichado.
— Y ¿cómo se llamaba ese capitán, señor mío? —preguntó el oidor.
— Llamábase —respondió el cura— Ruy Pérez de Viedma, y era natural de un
lugar de las montañas de León, el cual me contó un caso que a su padre
con sus hermanos le había sucedido, que, a no contármelo un hombre tan
verdadero como él, lo tuviera por conseja de aquellas que las viejas
cuentan el invierno al fuego. Porque me dijo que su padre había dividido su
hacienda entre tres hijos que tenía, y les había dado ciertos consejos,
mejores que los de Catón. Y sé yo decir que el que él escogió de venir a la
guerra le había sucedido tan bien que en pocos años, por su valor y
esfuerzo, sin otro brazo que el de su mucha virtud, subió a ser capitán de
infantería, y a verse en camino y predicamento de ser presto maestre de
campo. Pero fuele la fortuna contraria, pues donde la pudiera esperar y
tener buena, allí la perdió, con perder la libertad en la felicísima
jornada donde tantos la cobraron, que fue en la batalla de Lepanto. Yo la
perdí en la Goleta, y después, por diferentes sucesos, nos hallamos
camaradas en Costantinopla. Desde allí vino a Argel, donde sé que le
sucedió uno de los más estraños casos que en el mundo han sucedido.
De aquí fue prosiguiendo el cura, y, con brevedad sucinta, contó lo que con
Zoraida a su hermano había sucedido; a todo lo cual estaba tan atento el
oidor, que ninguna vez había sido tan oidor como entonces. Sólo llegó el
cura al punto de cuando los franceses despojaron a los cristianos que en la
barca venían, y la pobreza y necesidad en que su camarada y la hermosa mora
habían quedado; de los cuales no había sabido en qué habían parado, ni si
habían llegado a España, o llevádolos los franceses a Francia.
Todo lo que el cura decía estaba escuchando, algo de allí desviado, el
capitán, y notaba todos los movimientos que su hermano hacía; el cual,
viendo que ya el cura había llegado al fin de su cuento, dando un grande
suspiro y llenándosele los ojos de agua, dijo:
— ¡Oh, señor, si supiésedes las nuevas que me habéis contado, y cómo me
tocan tan en parte que me es forzoso dar muestras dello con estas lágrimas
que, contra toda mi discreción y recato, me salen por los ojos! Ese capitán
tan valeroso que decís es mi mayor hermano, el cual, como más fuerte y de
más altos pensamientos que yo ni otro hermano menor mío, escogió el honroso
y digno ejercicio de la guerra, que fue uno de los tres caminos que nuestro
padre nos propuso, según os dijo vuestra camarada en la conseja que, a
vuestro parecer, le oístes. Yo seguí el de las letras, en las cuales Dios y
mi diligencia me han puesto en el grado que me veis. Mi menor hermano está
en el Pirú, tan rico que con lo que ha enviado a mi padre y a mí ha
satisfecho bien la parte que él se llevó, y aun dado a las manos de mi
padre con que poder hartar su liberalidad natural; y yo, ansimesmo, he
podido con más decencia y autoridad tratarme en mis estudios y llegar al
puesto en que me veo. Vive aún mi padre, muriendo con el deseo de saber de
su hijo mayor, y pide a Dios con continuas oraciones no cierre la muerte
sus ojos hasta que él vea con vida a los de su hijo; del cual me maravillo,
siendo tan discreto, cómo en tantos trabajos y afliciones, o prósperos
sucesos, se haya descuidado de dar noticia de sí a su padre; que si él lo
supiera, o alguno de nosotros, no tuviera necesidad de aguardar al milagro
de la caña para alcanzar su rescate. Pero de lo que yo agora me temo es de
pensar si aquellos franceses le habrán dado libertad, o le habrán muerto
por encubrir su hurto. Esto todo será que yo prosiga mi viaje, no con aquel
contento con que le comencé, sino con toda melancolía y tristeza. ¡Oh buen
hermano mío, y quién supiera agora dónde estabas; que yo te fuera a buscar
y a librar de tus trabajos, aunque fuera a costa de los míos! ¡Oh, quién
llevara nuevas a nuestro viejo padre de que tenías vida, aunque estuvieras
en las mazmorras más escondidas de Berbería; que de allí te sacaran sus
riquezas, las de mi hermano y las mías! ¡Oh Zoraida hermosa y liberal,
quién pudiera pagar el bien que a un hermano hiciste!; ¡quién pudiera
hallarse al renacer de tu alma, y a las bodas, que tanto gusto a todos nos
dieran!
Estas y otras semejantes palabras decía el oidor, lleno de tanta compasión
con las nuevas que de su hermano le habían dado, que todos los que le oían
le acompañaban en dar muestras del sentimiento que tenían de su lástima.
Viendo, pues, el cura que tan bien había salido con su intención y con lo
que deseaba el capitán, no quiso tenerlos a todos más tiempo tristes, y
así, se levantó de la mesa, y, entrando donde estaba Zoraida, la tomó por
la mano, y tras ella se vinieron Luscinda, Dorotea y la hija del oidor.
Estaba esperando el capitán a ver lo que el cura quería hacer, que fue que,
tomándole a él asimesmo de la otra mano, con entrambos a dos se fue donde
el oidor y los demás caballeros estaban, y dijo:
— Cesen, señor oidor, vuestras lágrimas, y cólmese vuestro deseo de todo el
bien que acertare a desearse, pues tenéis delante a vuestro buen hermano y
a vuestra buena cuñada. Éste que aquí veis es el capitán Viedma, y ésta, la
hermosa mora que tanto bien le hizo. Los franceses que os dije los pusieron
en la estrecheza que veis, para que vos mostréis la liberalidad de vuestro
buen pecho.
Acudió el capitán a abrazar a su hermano, y él le puso ambas manos en los
pechos por mirarle algo más apartado; mas, cuando le acabó de conocer, le
abrazó tan estrechamente, derramando tan tiernas lágrimas de contento,que
los más de los que presentes estaban le hubieron de acompañar en ellas. Las
palabras que entrambos hermanos se dijeron, los sentimientos que mostraron,
apenas creo que pueden pensarse, cuanto más escribirse. Allí, en breves
razones, se dieron cuenta de sus sucesos; allí mostraron puesta en su punto
la buena amistad de dos hermanos; allí abrazó el oidor a Zoraida; allí la
ofreció su hacienda; allí hizo que la abrazase su hija; allí la cristiana
hermosa y la mora hermosísima renovaron las lágrimas de todos.
Allí don Quijote estaba atento, sin hablar palabra, considerando estos tan
estraños sucesos, atribuyéndolos todos a quimeras de la andante caballería.
Allí concertaron que el capitán y Zoraida se volviesen con su hermano a
Sevilla y avisasen a su padre de su hallazgo y libertad, para que, como
pudiese, viniese a hallarse en las bodas y bautismo de Zoraida, por no le
ser al oidor posible dejar el camino que llevaba, a causa de tener nuevas
que de allí a un mes partía la flota de Sevilla a la Nueva España, y
fuérale de grande incomodidad perder el viaje.
En resolución, todos quedaron contentos y alegres del buen suceso del
cautivo; y, como ya la noche iba casi en las dos partes de su jornada,
acordaron de recogerse y reposar lo que de ella les quedaba. Don Quijote se
ofreció a hacer la guardia del castillo, porque de algún gigante o otro mal
andante follón no fuesen acometidos, codiciosos del gran tesoro de
hermosura que en aquel castillo se encerraba. Agradeciéronselo los que le
conocían, y dieron al oidor cuenta del humor estraño de don Quijote, de que
no poco gusto recibió.
Sólo Sancho Panza se desesperaba con la tardanza del recogimiento, y sólo
él se acomodó mejor que todos, echándose sobre los aparejos de su jumento,
que le costaron tan caros como adelante se dirá.
Recogidas, pues, las damas en su estancia, y los demás acomodádose como
menos mal pudieron, don Quijote se salió fuera de la venta a hacer la
centinela del castillo, como lo había prometido.
Sucedió, pues, que faltando poco por venir el alba, llegó a los oídos de
las damas una voz tan entonada y tan buena, que les obligó a que todas le
prestasen atento oído, especialmente Dorotea, que despierta estaba, a cuyo
lado dormía doña Clara de Viedma, que ansí se llamaba la hija del oidor.
Nadie podía imaginar quién era la persona que tan bien cantaba, y era una
voz sola, sin que la acompañase instrumento alguno. Unas veces les parecía
que cantaban en el patio; otras, que en la caballeriza; y, estando en esta
confusión muy atentas, llegó a la puerta del aposento Cardenio y dijo:
— Quien no duerme, escuche; que oirán una voz de un mozo de mulas, que de
tal manera canta que encanta.
— Ya lo oímos, señor —respondió Dorotea.
Y, con esto, se fue Cardenio; y Dorotea, poniendo toda la atención posible,
entendió que lo que se cantaba era esto:
Capítulo XLIII. Donde se cuenta la agradable historia del mozo de mulas,
con otros estraños acaecimientos en la venta sucedidos]
-Marinero soy de amor,
y en su piélago profundo
navego sin esperanza
de llegar a puerto alguno.
Siguiendo voy a una estrella
que desde lejos descubro,
más bella y resplandeciente
que cuantas vio Palinuro.
Yo no sé adónde me guía,
y así, navego confuso,
el alma a mirarla atenta,
cuidadosa y con descuido.
Recatos impertinentes,
honestidad contra el uso,
son nubes que me la encubren
cuando más verla procuro.
¡Oh clara y luciente estrella,
en cuya lumbre me apuro!;
al punto que te me encubras,
será de mi muerte el punto.
Llegando el que cantaba a este punto, le pareció a Dorotea que no sería
bien que dejase Clara de oír una tan buena voz; y así, moviéndola a una y a
otra parte, la despertó diciéndole:
— Perdóname, niña, que te despierto, pues lo hago porque gustes de oír la
mejor voz que quizá habrás oído en toda tu vida.
Clara despertó toda soñolienta, y de la primera vez no entendió lo que
Dorotea le decía; y, volviéndoselo a preguntar, ella se lo volvió a decir,
por lo cual estuvo atenta Clara. Pero, apenas hubo oído dos versos que el
que cantaba iba prosiguiendo, cuando le tomó un temblor tan estraño como si
de algún grave accidente de cuartana estuviera enferma, y, abrazándose
estrechamente con Teodora, le dijo:
— ¡Ay señora de mi alma y de mi vida!, ¿para qué me despertastes?; que el
mayor bien que la fortuna me podía hacer por ahora era tenerme cerrados los
ojos y los oídos, para no ver ni oír a ese desdichado músico.
— ¿Qué es lo que dices, niña?; mira que dicen que el que canta es un mozo de
mulas.
— No es sino señor de lugares —respondió Clara—, y el que le tiene en mi
alma con tanta seguridad que si él no quiere dejalle, no le será quitado
eternamente.
Admirada quedó Dorotea de las sentidas razones de la muchacha, pareciéndole
que se aventajaban en mucho a la discreción que sus pocos años prometían; y
así, le dijo:
— Habláis de modo, señora Clara, que no puedo entenderos: declaraos más y
decidme qué es lo que decís de alma y de lugares, y deste músico, cuya voz
tan inquieta os tiene. Pero no me digáis nada por ahora, que no quiero
perder, por acudir a vuestro sobresalto, el gusto que recibo de oír al que
canta; que me parece que con nuevos versos y nuevo tono torna a su canto.
— Sea en buen hora —respondió Clara.
Y, por no oílle, se tapó con las manos entrambos oídos, de lo que también
se admiró Dorotea; la cual, estando atenta a lo que se cantaba, vio que
proseguían en esta manera:
-Dulce esperanza mía,
que, rompiendo imposibles y malezas,
sigues firme la vía
que tú mesma te finges y aderezas:
no te desmaye el verte
a cada paso junto al de tu muerte.
No alcanzan perezosos
honrados triunfos ni vitoria alguna,
ni pueden ser dichosos
los que, no contrastando a la fortuna,
entregan, desvalidos,
al ocio blando todos los sentidos.
Que amor sus glorias venda
caras, es gran razón, y es trato justo,
pues no hay más rica prenda
que la que se quilata por su gusto;
y es cosa manifiesta
que no es de estima lo que poco cuesta.
Amorosas porfías
tal vez alcanzan imposibles cosas;
y ansí, aunque con las mías
sigo de amor las más dificultosas,
no por eso recelo
de no alcanzar desde la tierra el cielo.
Aquí dio fin la voz, y principio a nuevos sollozos Clara. Todo lo cual
encendía el deseo de Dorotea, que deseaba saber la causa de tan suave canto
y de tan triste lloro. Y así, le volvió a preguntar qué era lo que le
quería decir denantes. Entonces Clara, temerosa de que Luscinda no la
oyese, abrazando estrechamente a Dorotea, puso su boca tan junto del oído
de Dorotea, que seguramente podía hablar sin ser de otro sentida, y así le
dijo:
— Este que canta, señora mía, es un hijo de un caballero natural del reino
de Aragón, señor de dos lugares, el cual vivía frontero de la casa de mi
padre en la Corte; y, aunque mi padre tenía las ventanas de su casa con
lienzos en el invierno y celosías en el verano, yo no sé lo que fue, ni lo
que no, que este caballero, que andaba al estudio, me vio, ni sé si en la
iglesia o en otra parte. Finalmente, él se enamoró de mí, y me lo dio a
entender desde las ventanas de su casa con tantas señas y con tantas
lágrimas, que yo le hube de creer, y aun querer, sin saber lo que me
quería. Entre las señas que me hacía, era una de juntarse la una mano con
la otra, dándome a entender que se casaría conmigo; y, aunque yo me
holgaría mucho de que ansí fuera, como sola y sin madre, no sabía con quién
comunicallo, y así, lo dejé estar sin dalle otro favor si no era, cuando
estaba mi padre fuera de casa y el suyo también, alzar un poco el lienzo o
la celosía y dejarme ver toda, de lo que él hacía tanta fiesta, que daba
señales de volverse loco. Llegóse en esto el tiempo de la partida de mi
padre, la cual él supo, y no de mí, pues nunca pude decírselo. Cayó malo, a
lo que yo entiendo, de pesadumbre; y así, el día que nos partimos nunca
pude verle para despedirme dél, siquiera con los ojos. Pero, a cabo de dos
días que caminábamos, al entrar de una posada, en un lugar una jornada de
aquí, le vi a la puerta del mesón, puesto en hábito de mozo de mulas, tan
al natural que si yo no le trujera tan retratado en mi alma fuera imposible
conocelle. Conocíle, admiréme y alegréme; él me miró a hurto de mi padre,
de quien él siempre se esconde cuando atraviesa por delante de mí en los
caminos y en las posadas do llegamos; y, como yo sé quién es, y considero
que por amor de mí viene a pie y con tanto trabajo, muérome de pesadumbre,
y adonde él pone los pies pongo yo los ojos. No sé con qué intención viene,
ni cómo ha podido escaparse de su padre, que le quiere estraordinariamente,
porque no tiene otro heredero, y porque él lo merece, como lo verá vuestra
merced cuando le vea. Y más le sé decir: que todo aquello que canta lo saca
de su cabeza; que he oído decir que es muy gran estudiante y poeta. Y hay
más: que cada vez que le veo o le oigo cantar, tiemblo toda y me
sobresalto, temerosa de que mi padre le conozca y venga en conocimiento de
nuestros deseos. En mi vida le he hablado palabra, y, con todo eso, le
quiero de manera que no he de poder vivir sin él. Esto es, señora mía, todo
lo que os puedo decir deste músico, cuya voz tanto os ha contentado; que en
sola ella echaréis bien de ver que no es mozo de mulas, como decís, sino
señor de almas y lugares, como yo os he dicho.
— No digáis más, señora doña Clara —dijo a esta sazón Dorotea, y esto,
besándola mil veces—; no digáis más, digo, y esperad que venga el nuevo
día, que yo espero en Dios de encaminar de manera vuestros negocios, que
tengan el felice fin que tan honestos principios merecen.
— ¡Ay señora! —dijo doña Clara—, ¿qué fin se puede esperar, si su padre es
tan principal y tan rico que le parecerá que aun yo no puedo ser criada de
su hijo, cuanto más esposa? Pues casarme yo a hurto de mi padre, no lo haré
por cuanto hay en el mundo. No querría sino que este mozo se volviese y me
dejase; quizá con no velle y con la gran distancia del camino que llevamos
se me aliviaría la pena que ahora llevo, aunque sé decir que este remedio
que me imagino me ha de aprovechar bien poco. No sé qué diablos ha sido
esto, ni por dónde se ha entrado este amor que le tengo, siendo yo tan
muchacha y él tan muchacho, que en verdad que creo que somos de una edad
mesma, y que yo no tengo cumplidos diez y seis años; que para el día de San
Miguel que vendrá dice mi padre que los cumplo.
No pudo dejar de reírse Dorotea, oyendo cuán como niña hablaba doña Clara,
a quien dijo:
— Reposemos, señora, lo poco que creo queda de la noche, y amanecerá Dios y
medraremos, o mal me andarán las manos.
Sosegáronse con esto, y en toda la venta se guardaba un grande silencio;
solamente no dormían la hija de la ventera y Maritornes, su criada, las
cuales, como ya sabían el humor de que pecaba don Quijote, y que estaba
fuera de la venta armado y a caballo haciendo la guarda, determinaron las
dos de hacelle alguna burla, o, a lo menos, de pasar un poco el tiempo
oyéndole sus disparates.
Es, pues, el caso que en toda la venta no había ventana que saliese al
campo, sino un agujero de un pajar, por donde echaban la paja por defuera.
A este agujero se pusieron las dos semidoncellas, y vieron que don Quijote
estaba a caballo, recostado sobre su lanzón, dando de cuando en cuando tan
dolientes y profundos suspiros que parecía, que con cada uno se le
arrancaba el alma. Y asimesmo oyeron que decía con voz blanda, regalada y
amorosa:
— ¡Oh mi señora Dulcinea del Toboso, estremo de toda hermosura, fin y remate
de la discreción, archivo del mejor donaire, depósito de la honestidad, y,
ultimadamente, idea de todo lo provechoso, honesto y deleitable que hay en
el mundo! Y ¿qué fará agora la tu merced? ¿Si tendrás por ventura las
mientes en tu cautivo caballero, que a tantos peligros, por sólo servirte,
de su voluntad ha querido ponerse? Dame tú nuevas della, ¡oh luminaria de
las tres caras! Quizá con envidia de la suya la estás ahora mirando; que, o
paseándose por alguna galería de sus suntuosos palacios, o ya puesta de
pechos sobre algún balcón, está considerando cómo, salva su honestidad y
grandeza, ha de amansar la tormenta que por ella este mi cuitado corazón
padece, qué gloria ha de dar a mis penas, qué sosiego a mi cuidado y,
finalmente, qué vida a mi muerte y qué premio a mis servicios. Y tú, sol,
que ya debes de estar apriesa ensillando tus caballos, por madrugar y salir
a ver a mi señora, así como la veas, suplícote que de mi parte la saludes;
pero guárdate que al verla y saludarla no le des paz en el rostro, que
tendré más celos de ti que tú los tuviste de aquella ligera ingrata que
tanto te hizo sudar y correr por los llanos de Tesalia, o por las riberas
de Peneo, que no me acuerdo bien por dónde corriste entonces celoso y
enamorado.
A este punto llegaba entonces don Quijote en su tan lastimero
razonamiento, cuando la hija de la ventera le comenzó a cecear y a
decirle:
— Señor mío, lléguese acá la vuestra merced si es servido.
A cuyas señas y voz volvió don Quijote la cabeza, y vio, a la luz de la
luna, que entonces estaba en toda su claridad, cómo le llamaban del agujero
que a él le pareció ventana, y aun con rejas doradas, como conviene que las
tengan tan ricos castillos como él se imaginaba que era aquella venta; y
luego en el instante se le representó en su loca imaginación que otra vez,
como la pasada, la doncella fermosa, hija de la señora de aquel castillo,
vencida de su amor, tornaba a solicitarle; y con este pensamiento, por no
mostrarse descortés y desagradecido, volvió las riendas a Rocinante y se
llegó al agujero, y, así como vio a las dos mozas, dijo:
— Lástima os tengo, fermosa señora, de que hayades puesto vuestras amorosas
mientes en parte donde no es posible corresponderos conforme merece vuestro
gran valor y gentileza; de lo que no debéis dar culpa a este miserable
andante caballero, a quien tiene amor imposibilitado de poder entregar su
voluntad a otra que aquella que, en el punto que sus ojos la vieron, la
hizo señora absoluta de su alma. Perdonadme, buena señora, y recogeos en
vuestro aposento, y no queráis, con significarme más vuestros deseos, que
yo me muestre más desagradecido; y si del amor que me tenéis halláis en mí
otra cosa con que satisfaceros, que el mismo amor no sea, pedídmela; que yo
os juro, por aquella ausente enemiga dulce mía, de dárosla en continente,
si bien me pidiésedes una guedeja de los cabellos de Medusa, que eran todos
culebras, o ya los mesmos rayos del sol encerrados en una redoma.
— No ha menester nada deso mi señora, señor caballero —dijo a este punto
Maritornes.
— Pues, ¿qué ha menester, discreta dueña, vuestra señora? —respondió don
Quijote.
— Sola una de vuestras hermosas manos —dijo Maritornes—, por poder deshogar
con ella el gran deseo que a este agujero la ha traído, tan a peligro de su
honor que si su señor padre la hubiera sentido, la menor tajada della fuera
la oreja.
— ¡Ya quisiera yo ver eso! —respondió don Quijote—; pero él se guardará bien
deso, si ya no quiere hacer el más desastrado fin que padre hizo en el
mundo, por haber puesto las manos en los delicados miembros de su enamorada
hija.
Parecióle a Maritornes que sin duda don Quijote daría la mano que le habían
pedido, y, proponiendo en su pensamiento lo que había de hacer, se bajó del
agujero y se fue a la caballeriza, donde tomó el cabestro del jumento de
Sancho Panza, y con mucha presteza se volvió a su agujero, a tiempo que don
Quijote se había puesto de pies sobre la silla de Rocinante, por alcanzar a
la ventana enrejada, donde se imaginaba estar la ferida doncella; y, al
darle la mano, dijo:
— Tomad, señora, esa mano, o, por mejor decir, ese verdugo de los
malhechores del mundo; tomad esa mano, digo, a quien no ha tocado otra de
mujer alguna, ni aun la de aquella que tiene entera posesión de todo mi
cuerpo. No os la doy para que la beséis, sino para que miréis la contestura
de sus nervios, la trabazón de sus músculos, la anchura y espaciosidad de
sus venas; de donde sacaréis qué tal debe de ser la fuerza del brazo que
tal mano tiene.
— Ahora lo veremos —dijo Maritornes.
Y, haciendo una lazada corrediza al cabestro, se la echó a la muñeca, y,
bajándose del agujero, ató lo que quedaba al cerrojo de la puerta del pajar
muy fuertemente. Don Quijote, que sintió la aspereza del cordel en su
muñeca, dijo:
— Más parece que vuestra merced me ralla que no que me regala la mano; no la
tratéis tan mal, pues ella no tiene la culpa del mal que mi voluntad os
hace, ni es bien que en tan poca parte venguéis el todo de vuestro enojo.
Mirad que quien quiere bien no se venga tan mal.
Pero todas estas razones de don Quijote ya no las escuchaba nadie, porque,
así como Maritornes le ató, ella y la otra se fueron, muertas de risa, y le
dejaron asido de manera que fue imposible soltarse.
Estaba, pues, como se ha dicho, de pies sobre Rocinante, metido todo el
brazo por el agujero y atado de la muñeca, y al cerrojo de la puerta, con
grandísimo temor y cuidado, que si Rocinante se desviaba a un cabo o a
otro, había de quedar colgado del brazo; y así, no osaba hacer movimiento
alguno, puesto que de la paciencia y quietud de Rocinante bien se podía
esperar que estaría sin moverse un siglo entero.
En resolución, viéndose don Quijote atado, y que ya las damas se habían
ido, se dio a imaginar que todo aquello se hacía por vía de encantamento,
como la vez pasada, cuando en aquel mesmo castillo le molió aquel moro
encantado del arriero; y maldecía entre sí su poca discreción y discurso,
pues, habiendo salido tan mal la vez primera de aquel castillo, se había
aventurado a entrar en él la segunda, siendo advertimiento de caballeros
andantes que, cuando han probado una aventura y no salido bien con ella, es
señal que no está para ellos guardada, sino para otros; y así, no tienen
necesidad de probarla segunda vez. Con todo esto, tiraba de su brazo, por
ver si podía soltarse; mas él estaba tan bien asido, que todas sus pruebas
fueron en vano. Bien es verdad que tiraba con tiento, porque Rocinante no
se moviese; y, aunque él quisiera sentarse y ponerse en la silla, no podía
sino estar en pie, o arrancarse la mano.
Allí fue el desear de la espada de Amadís, contra quien no tenía fuerza de
encantamento alguno; allí fue el maldecir de su fortuna; allí fue el
exagerar la falta que haría en el mundo su presencia el tiempo que allí
estuviese encantado, que sin duda alguna se había creído que lo estaba;
allí el acordarse de nuevo de su querida Dulcinea del Toboso; allí fue el
llamar a su buen escudero Sancho Panza, que, sepultado en sueño y tendido
sobre el albarda de su jumento, no se acordaba en aquel instante de la
madre que lo había parido; allí llamó a los sabios Lirgandeo y Alquife, que
le ayudasen; allí invocó a su buena amiga Urganda, que le socorriese, y,
finalmente, allí le tomó la mañana, tan desesperado y confuso que bramaba
como un toro; porque no esperaba él que con el día se remediara su cuita,
porque la tenía por eterna, teniéndose por encantado. Y hacíale creer esto
ver que Rocinante poco ni mucho se movía, y creía que de aquella suerte,
sin comer ni beber ni dormir, habían de estar él y su caballo, hasta que
aquel mal influjo de las estrellas se pasase, o hasta que otro más sabio
encantador le desencantase.
Pero engañóse mucho en su creencia, porque, apenas comenzó a amanecer,
cuando llegaron a la venta cuatro hombres de a caballo, muy bien puestos y
aderezados, con sus escopetas sobre los arzones. Llamaron a la puerta de la
venta, que aún estaba cerrada, con grandes golpes; lo cual, visto por don
Quijote desde donde aún no dejaba de hacer la centinela, con voz arrogante
y alta dijo:
— Caballeros, o escuderos, o quienquiera que seáis: no tenéis para qué
llamar a las puertas deste castillo; que asaz de claro está que a tales
horas, o los que están dentro duermen, o no tienen por costumbre de abrirse
las fortalezas hasta que el sol esté tendido por todo el suelo. Desviaos
afuera, y esperad que aclare el día, y entonces veremos si será justo o no
que os abran.
— ¿Qué diablos de fortaleza o castillo es éste —dijo uno—, para obligarnos a
guardar esas ceremonias? Si sois el ventero, mandad que nos abran, que
somos caminantes que no queremos más de dar cebada a nuestras cabalgaduras
y pasar adelante, porque vamos de priesa.
— ¿Paréceos, caballeros, que tengo yo talle de ventero? —respondió don
Quijote.
— No sé de qué tenéis talle —respondió el otro—, pero sé que decís
disparates en llamar castillo a esta venta.
— Castillo es —replicó don Quijote—, y aun de los mejores de toda esta
provincia; y gente tiene dentro que ha tenido cetro en la mano y corona en
la cabeza.
— Mejor fuera al revés —dijo el caminante—: el cetro en la cabeza y la
corona en la mano. Y será, si a mano viene, que debe de estar dentro alguna
compañía de representantes, de los cuales es tener a menudo esas coronas y
cetros que decís, porque en una venta tan pequeña, y adonde se guarda tanto
silencio como ésta, no creo yo que se alojan personas dignas de corona y
cetro.
— Sabéis poco del mundo —replicó don Quijote—, pues ignoráis los casos que
suelen acontecer en la caballería andante.
Cansábanse los compañeros que con el preguntante venían del coloquio que
con don Quijote pasaba, y así, tornaron a llamar con grande furia; y fue de
modo que el ventero despertó, y aun todos cuantos en la venta estaban; y
así, se levantó a preguntar quién llamaba. Sucedió en este tiempo que una
de las cabalgaduras en que venían los cuatro que llamaban se llegó a oler a
Rocinante, que, melancólico y triste, con las orejas caídas, sostenía sin
moverse a su estirado señor; y como, en fin, era de carne, aunque parecía
de leño, no pudo dejar de resentirse y tornar a oler a quien le llegaba a
hacer caricias; y así, no se hubo movido tanto cuanto, cuando se desviaron
los juntos pies de don Quijote, y, resbalando de la silla, dieran con él en
el suelo, a no quedar colgado del brazo: cosa que le causó tanto dolor que
creyó o que la muñeca le cortaban, o que el brazo se le arrancaba; porque
él quedó tan cerca del suelo que con los estremos de las puntas de los pies
besaba la tierra, que era en su perjuicio, porque, como sentía lo poco que
le faltaba para poner las plantas en la tierra, fatigábase y estirábase
cuanto podía por alcanzar al suelo: bien así como los que están en el
tormento de la garrucha, puestos a toca, no toca, que ellos mesmos son
causa de acrecentar su dolor, con el ahínco que ponen en estirarse,
engañados de la esperanza que se les representa, que con poco más que se
estiren llegarán al suelo.
Capítulo XLIV. Donde se prosiguen los inauditos sucesos de la venta
En efeto, fueron tantas las voces que don Quijote dio, que, abriendo de
presto las puertas de la venta, salió el ventero, despavorido, a ver quién
tales gritos daba, y los que estaban fuera hicieron lo mesmo. Maritornes,
que ya había despertado a las mismas voces, imaginando lo que podía ser, se
fue al pajar y desató, sin que nadie lo viese, el cabestro que a don
Quijote sostenía, y él dio luego en el suelo, a vista del ventero y de los
caminantes, que, llegándose a él, le preguntaron qué tenía, que tales voces
daba. Él, sin responder palabra, se quitó el cordel de la muñeca, y,
levantándose en pie, subió sobre Rocinante, embrazó su adarga, enristró su
lanzón, y, tomando buena parte del campo, volvió a medio galope, diciendo:
— Cualquiera que dijere que yo he sido con justo título encantado, como mi
señora la princesa Micomicona me dé licencia para ello, yo le desmiento, le
rieto y desafío a singular batalla.
Admirados se quedaron los nuevos caminantes de las palabras de don Quijote,
pero el ventero les quitó de aquella admiración, diciéndoles que era don
Quijote, y que no había que hacer caso dél, porque estaba fuera de juicio.
Preguntáronle al ventero si acaso había llegado a aquella venta un muchacho
de hasta edad de quince años, que venía vestido como mozo de mulas, de
tales y tales señas, dando las mesmas que traía el amante de doña Clara. El
ventero respondió que había tanta gente en la venta, que no había echado de
ver en el que preguntaban. Pero, habiendo visto uno dellos el coche donde
había venido el oidor, dijo:
— Aquí debe de estar sin duda, porque éste es el coche que él dicen que
sigue; quédese uno de nosotros a la puerta y entren los demás a buscarle; y
aun sería bien que uno de nosotros rodease toda la venta, porque no se
fuese por las bardas de los corrales.
— Así se hará —respondió uno dellos.
Y, entrándose los dos dentro, uno se quedó a la puerta y el otro se fue a
rodear la venta; todo lo cual veía el ventero, y no sabía atinar para qué
se hacían aquellas diligencias, puesto que bien creyó que buscaban aquel
mozo cuyas señas le habían dado.
Ya a esta sazón aclaraba el día; y, así por esto como por el ruido que don
Quijote había hecho, estaban todos despiertos y se levantaban,
especialmente doña Clara y Dorotea, que la una con sobresalto de tener tan
cerca a su amante, y la otra con el deseo de verle, habían podido dormir
bien mal aquella noche. Don Quijote, que vio que ninguno de los cuatro
caminantes hacía caso dél, ni le respondían a su demanda, moría y rabiaba
de despecho y saña; y si él hallara en las ordenanzas de su caballería que
lícitamente podía el caballero andante tomar y emprender otra empresa,
habiendo dado su palabra y fe de no ponerse en ninguna hasta acabar la que
había prometido, él embistiera con todos, y les hiciera responder mal de su
grado. Pero, por parecerle no convenirle ni estarle bien comenzar nueva
empresa hasta poner a Micomicona en su reino, hubo de callar y estarse
quedo, esperando a ver en qué paraban las diligencias de aquellos
caminantes; uno de los cuales halló al mancebo que buscaba, durmiendo al
lado de un mozo de mulas, bien descuidado de que nadie ni le buscase, ni
menos de que le hallase. El hombre le trabó del brazo y le dijo:
— Por cierto, señor don Luis, que responde bien a quien vos sois el hábito
que tenéis, y que dice bien la cama en que os hallo al regalo con que
vuestra madre os crió.
Limpióse el mozo los soñolientos ojos y miró de espacio al que le tenía
asido, y luego conoció que era criado de su padre, de que recibió tal
sobresalto, que no acertó o no pudo hablarle palabra por un buen espacio. Y
el criado prosiguió diciendo:
— Aquí no hay que hacer otra cosa, señor don Luis, sino prestar paciencia y
dar la vuelta a casa, si ya vuestra merced no gusta que su padre y mi señor
la dé al otro mundo, porque no se puede esperar otra cosa de la pena con
que queda por vuestra ausencia.
— Pues, ¿cómo supo mi padre —dijo don Luis— que yo venía este camino y en
este traje?
— Un estudiante —respondió el criado— a quien distes cuenta de vuestros
pensamientos fue el que lo descubrió, movido a lástima de las que vio que
hacía vuestro padre al punto que os echó de menos; y así, despachó a cuatro
de sus criados en vuestra busca, y todos estamos aquí a vuestro servicio,
más contentos de lo que imaginar se puede, por el buen despacho con que
tornaremos, llevándoos a los ojos que tanto os quieren.
— Eso será como yo quisiere, o como el cielo lo ordenare —respondió don
Luis.
— ¿Qué habéis de querer, o qué ha de ordenar el cielo, fuera de consentir en
volveros?; porque no ha de ser posible otra cosa.
Todas estas razones que entre los dos pasaban oyó el mozo de mulas junto a
quien don Luis estaba; y, levantándose de allí, fue a decir lo que pasaba a
don Fernando y a Cardenio, y a los demás, que ya vestido se habían; a los
cuales dijo cómo aquel hombre llamaba de don a aquel muchacho, y las
razones que pasaban, y cómo le quería volver a casa de su padre, y el mozo
no quería. Y con esto, y con lo que dél sabían de la buena voz que el cielo
le había dado, vinieron todos en gran deseo de saber más particularmente
quién era, y aun de ayudarle si alguna fuerza le quisiesen hacer; y así, se
fueron hacia la parte donde aún estaba hablando y porfiando con su criado.
Salía en esto Dorotea de su aposento, y tras ella doña Clara, toda turbada;
y, llamando Dorotea a Cardenio aparte, le contó en breves razones la
historia del músico y de doña Clara, a quien él también dijo lo que pasaba
de la venida a buscarle los criados de su padre, y no se lo dijo tan
callando que lo dejase de oír Clara; de lo que quedó tan fuera de sí que,
si Dorotea no llegara a tenerla, diera consigo en el suelo. Cardenio dijo a
Dorotea que se volviesen al aposento, que él procuraría poner remedio en
todo, y ellas lo hicieron.
Ya estaban todos los cuatro que venían a buscar a don Luis dentro de la
venta y rodeados dél, persuadiéndole que luego, sin detenerse un punto,
volviese a consolar a su padre. Él respondió que en ninguna manera lo podía
hacer hasta dar fin a un negocio en que le iba la vida, la honra y el alma.
Apretáronle entonces los criados, diciéndole que en ningún modo volverían
sin él, y que le llevarían, quisiese o no quisiese.
— Eso no haréis vosotros —replicó don Luis—, si no es llevándome muerto;
aunque, de cualquiera manera que me llevéis, será llevarme sin vida.
Ya a esta sazón habían acudido a la porfía todos los más que en la venta
estaban, especialmente Cardenio, don Fernando, sus camaradas, el oidor, el
cura, el barbero y don Quijote, que ya le pareció que no había necesidad de
guardar más el castillo. Cardenio, como ya sabía la historia del mozo,
preguntó a los que llevarle querían que qué les movía a querer llevar
contra su voluntad aquel muchacho.
— Muévenos —respondió uno de los cuatro— dar la vida a su padre, que por la
ausencia deste caballero queda a peligro de perderla.
A esto dijo don Luis:
— No hay para qué se dé cuenta aquí de mis cosas: yo soy libre, y volveré si
me diere gusto, y si no, ninguno de vosotros me ha de hacer fuerza.
— Harásela a vuestra merced la razón —respondió el hombre—; y, cuando ella
no bastare con vuestra merced, bastará con nosotros para hacer a lo que
venimos y lo que somos obligados.
— Sepamos qué es esto de raíz —dijo a este tiempo el oidor.
Pero el hombre, que lo conoció, como vecino de su casa, respondió:
— ¿No conoce vuestra merced, señor oidor, a este caballero, que es el hijo
de su vecino, el cual se ha ausentado de casa de su padre en el hábito tan
indecente a su calidad como vuestra merced puede ver?
Miróle entonces el oidor más atentamente y conocióle; y, abrazándole, dijo:
— ¿Qué niñerías son éstas, señor don Luis, o qué causas tan poderosas, que
os hayan movido a venir desta manera, y en este traje, que dice tan mal con
la calidad vuestra?
Al mozo se le vinieron las lágrimas a los ojos, y no pudo responder
palabra. El oidor dijo a los cuatro que se sosegasen, que todo se haría
bien; y, tomando por la mano a don Luis, le apartó a una parte y le
preguntó qué venida había sido aquélla.
Y, en tanto que le hacía esta y otras preguntas, oyeron grandes voces a la
puerta de la venta, y era la causa dellas que dos huéspedes que aquella
noche habían alojado en ella, viendo a toda la gente ocupada en saber lo
que los cuatro buscaban, habían intentado a irse sin pagar lo que debían;
mas el ventero, que atendía más a su negocio que a los ajenos, les asió al
salir de la puerta y pidió su paga, y les afeó su mala intención con tales
palabras, que les movió a que le respondiesen con los puños; y así, le
comenzaron a dar tal mano, que el pobre ventero tuvo necesidad de dar voces
y pedir socorro. La ventera y su hija no vieron a otro más desocupado para
poder socorrerle que a don Quijote, a quien la hija de la ventera dijo:
— Socorra vuestra merced, señor caballero, por la virtud que Dios le dio, a
mi pobre padre, que dos malos hombres le están moliendo como a cibera.
A lo cual respondió don Quijote, muy de espacio y con mucha flema:
— Fermosa doncella, no ha lugar por ahora vuestra petición, porque estoy
impedido de entremeterme en otra aventura en tanto que no diere cima a una
en que mi palabra me ha puesto. Mas lo que yo podré hacer por serviros es
lo que ahora diré: corred y decid a vuestro padre que se entretenga en esa
batalla lo mejor que pudiere, y que no se deje vencer en ningún modo, en
tanto que yo pido licencia a la princesa Micomicona para poder socorrerle
en su cuita; que si ella me la da, tened por cierto que yo le sacaré della.
— ¡Pecadora de mí! —dijo a esto Maritornes, que estaba delante—: primero que
vuestra merced alcance esa licencia que dice, estará ya mi señor en el otro
mundo.
— Dadme vos, señora, que yo alcance la licencia que digo —respondió don
Quijote—; que, como yo la tenga, poco hará al caso que él esté en el otro
mundo; que de allí le sacaré a pesar del mismo mundo que lo contradiga; o,
por lo menos, os daré tal venganza de los que allá le hubieren enviado, que
quedéis más que medianamente satisfechas.
Y sin decir más se fue a poner de hinojos ante Dorotea, pidiéndole con
palabras caballerescas y andantescas que la su grandeza fuese servida de
darle licencia de acorrer y socorrer al castellano de aquel castillo, que
estaba puesto en una grave mengua. La princesa se la dio de buen talante, y
él luego, embrazando su adarga y poniendo mano a su espada, acudió a la
puerta de la venta, adonde aún todavía traían los dos huéspedes a mal traer
al ventero; pero, así como llegó, embazó y se estuvo quedo, aunque
Maritornes y la ventera le decían que en qué se detenía, que socorriese a
su señor y marido.
— Deténgome —dijo don Quijote— porque no me es lícito poner mano a la espada
contra gente escuderil; pero llamadme aquí a mi escudero Sancho, que a él
toca y atañe esta defensa y venganza.
Esto pasaba en la puerta de la venta, y en ella andaban las puñadas y
mojicones muy en su punto, todo en daño del ventero y en rabia de
Maritornes, la ventera y su hija, que se desesperaban de ver la cobardía de
don Quijote, y de lo mal que lo pasaba su marido, señor y padre.
Pero dejémosle aquí, que no faltará quien le socorra, o si no, sufra y
calle el que se atreve a más de a lo que sus fuerzas le prometen, y
volvámonos atrás cincuenta pasos, a ver qué fue lo que don Luis respondió
al oidor, que le dejamos aparte, preguntándole la causa de su venida a pie
y de tan vil traje vestido. A lo cual el mozo, asiéndole fuertemente de las
manos, como en señal de que algún gran dolor le apretaba el corazón, y
derramando lágrimas en grande abundancia, le dijo:
— Señor mío, yo no sé deciros otra cosa sino que desde el punto que quiso el
cielo y facilitó nuestra vecindad que yo viese a mi señora doña Clara, hija
vuestra y señora mía, desde aquel instante la hice dueño de mi voluntad; y
si la vuestra, verdadero señor y padre mío, no lo impide, en este mesmo día
ha de ser mi esposa. Por ella dejé la casa de mi padre, y por ella me puse
en este traje, para seguirla dondequiera que fuese, como la saeta al
blanco, o como el marinero al norte. Ella no sabe de mis deseos más de lo
que ha podido entender de algunas veces que desde lejos ha visto llorar mis
ojos. Ya, señor, sabéis la riqueza y la nobleza de mis padres, y como yo
soy su único heredero: si os parece que éstas son partes para que os
aventuréis a hacerme en todo venturoso, recebidme luego por vuestro hijo;
que si mi padre, llevado de otros disignios suyos, no gustare deste bien
que yo supe buscarme, más fuerza tiene el tiempo para deshacer y mudar las
cosas que las humanas voluntades.
Calló, en diciendo esto, el enamorado mancebo, y el oidor quedó en oírle
suspenso, confuso y admirado, así de haber oído el modo y la discreción con
que don Luis le había descubierto su pensamiento, como de verse en punto
que no sabía el que poder tomar en tan repentino y no esperado negocio; y
así, no respondió otra cosa sino que se sosegase por entonces, y
entretuviese a sus criados, que por aquel día no le volviesen, porque se
tuviese tiempo para considerar lo que mejor a todos estuviese. Besóle las
manos por fuerza don Luis, y aun se las bañó con lágrimas, cosa que pudiera
enternecer un corazón de mármol, no sólo el del oidor, que, como discreto,
ya había conocido cuán bien le estaba a su hija aquel matrimonio; puesto
que, si fuera posible, lo quisiera efetuar con voluntad del padre de don
Luis, del cual sabía que pretendía hacer de título a su hijo.
Ya a esta sazón estaban en paz los huéspedes con el ventero, pues, por
persuasión y buenas razones de don Quijote, más que por amenazas, le habían
pagado todo lo que él quiso, y los criados de don Luis aguardaban el fin de
la plática del oidor y la resolución de su amo, cuando el demonio, que no
duerme, ordenó que en aquel mesmo punto entró en la venta el barbero a
quien don Quijote quitó el yelmo de Mambrino y Sancho Panza los aparejos
del asno, que trocó con los del suyo; el cual barbero, llevando su jumento
a la caballeriza, vio a Sancho Panza que estaba aderezando no sé qué de la
albarda, y así como la vio la conoció, y se atrevió a arremeter a Sancho,
diciendo:
— ¡Ah don ladrón, que aquí os tengo! ¡Venga mi bacía y mi albarda, con todos
mis aparejos que me robastes!
Sancho, que se vio acometer tan de improviso y oyó los vituperios que le
decían, con la una mano asió de la albarda, y con la otra dio un mojicón al
barbero que le bañó los dientes en sangre; pero no por esto dejó el barbero
la presa que tenía hecha en el albarda; antes, alzó la voz de tal manera
que todos los de la venta acudieron al ruido y pendencia, y decía:
— ¡Aquí del rey y de la justicia, que, sobre cobrar mi hacienda, me quiere
matar este ladrón salteador de caminos!
— Mentís —respondió Sancho—, que yo no soy salteador de caminos; que en
buena guerra ganó mi señor don Quijote estos despojos.
Ya estaba don Quijote delante, con mucho contento de ver cuán bien se
defendía y ofendía su escudero, y túvole desde allí adelante por hombre de
pro, y propuso en su corazón de armalle caballero en la primera ocasión que
se le ofreciese, por parecerle que sería en él bien empleada la orden de la
caballería. Entre otras cosas que el barbero decía en el discurso de la
pendencia, vino a decir:
— Señores, así esta albarda es mía como la muerte que debo a Dios, y así la
conozco como si la hubiera parido; y ahí está mi asno en el establo, que no
me dejará mentir; si no, pruébensela, y si no le viniere pintiparada, yo
quedaré por infame. Y hay más: que el mismo día que ella se me quitó, me
quitaron también una bacía de azófar nueva, que no se había estrenado, que
era señora de un escudo.
Aquí no se pudo contener don Quijote sin responder: y, poniéndose entre los
dos y apartándoles, depositando la albarda en el suelo, que la tuviese de
manifiesto hasta que la verdad se aclarase, dijo:
— ¡Porque vean vuestras mercedes clara y manifiestamente el error en que
está este buen escudero, pues llama bacía a lo que fue, es y será yelmo de
Mambrino, el cual se lo quité yo en buena guerra, y me hice señor dél con
ligítima y lícita posesión! En lo del albarda no me entremeto, que lo que
en ello sabré decir es que mi escudero Sancho me pidió licencia para quitar
los jaeces del caballo deste vencido cobarde, y con ellos adornar el suyo;
yo se la di, y él los tomó, y, de haberse convertido de jaez en albarda, no
sabré dar otra razón si no es la ordinaria: que como esas transformaciones
se ven en los sucesos de la caballería; para confirmación de lo cual,
corre, Sancho hijo, y saca aquí el yelmo que este buen hombre dice ser
bacía.
— ¡Pardiez, señor —dijo Sancho—, si no tenemos otra prueba de nuestra
intención que la que vuestra merced dice, tan bacía es el yelmo de Malino
como el jaez deste buen hombre albarda!
— Haz lo que te mando —replicó don Quijote—, que no todas las cosas deste
castillo han de ser guiadas por encantamento.
Sancho fue a do estaba la bacía y la trujo; y, así como don Quijote la vio,
la tomó en las manos y dijo:
— Miren vuestras mercedes con qué cara podía decir este escudero que ésta es
bacía, y no el yelmo que yo he dicho; y juro por la orden de caballería que
profeso que este yelmo fue el mismo que yo le quité, sin haber añadido en
él ni quitado cosa alguna.
— En eso no hay duda —dijo a esta sazón Sancho—, porque desde que mi señor
le ganó hasta agora no ha hecho con él más de una batalla, cuando libró a
los sin ventura encadenados; y si no fuera por este baciyelmo, no lo pasara
entonces muy bien, porque hubo asaz de pedradas en aquel trance.
Capítulo XLV. Donde se acaba de averiguar la duda del yelmo de Mambrino y
de la albarda, y otras aventuras sucedidas, con toda verdad
— ¿Qué les parece a vuestras mercedes, señores —dijo el barbero—, de lo que
afirman estos gentiles hombres, pues aún porfían que ésta no es bacía,
sino yelmo?
— Y quien lo contrario dijere —dijo don Quijote—, le haré yo conocer que
miente, si fuere caballero, y si escudero, que remiente mil veces.
Nuestro barbero, que a todo estaba presente, como tenía tan bien conocido
el humor de don Quijote, quiso esforzar su desatino y llevar adelante la
burla para que todos riesen, y dijo, hablando con el otro barbero:
— Señor barbero, o quien sois, sabed que yo también soy de vuestro oficio, y
tengo más ha de veinte años carta de examen, y conozco muy bien de todos
los instrumentos de la barbería, sin que le falte uno; y ni más ni menos
fui un tiempo en mi mocedad soldado, y sé también qué es yelmo, y qué es
morrión, y celada de encaje, y otras cosas tocantes a la milicia, digo, a
los géneros de armas de los soldados; y digo, salvo mejor parecer,
remitiéndome siempre al mejor entendimiento, que esta pieza que está aquí
delante y que este buen señor tiene en las manos, no sólo no es bacía de
barbero, pero está tan lejos de serlo como está lejos lo blanco de lo negro
y la verdad de la mentira; también digo que éste, aunque es yelmo, no es
yelmo entero.
— No, por cierto —dijo don Quijote—, porque le falta la mitad, que es la
babera.
— Así es —dijo el cura, que ya había entendido la intención de su amigo el
barbero.
Y lo mismo confirmó Cardenio, don Fernando y sus camaradas; y aun el oidor,
si no estuviera tan pensativo con el negocio de don Luis, ayudara, por su
parte, a la burla; pero las veras de lo que pensaba le tenían tan suspenso,
que poco o nada atendía a aquellos donaires.
— ¡Válame Dios! —dijo a esta sazón el barbero burlado—; ¿que es posible que
tanta gente honrada diga que ésta no es bacía, sino yelmo? Cosa parece ésta
que puede poner en admiración a toda una Universidad, por discreta que sea.
Basta: si es que esta bacía es yelmo, también debe de ser esta albarda jaez
de caballo, como este señor ha dicho.
— A mí albarda me parece —dijo don Quijote—, pero ya he dicho que en eso no
me entremeto.
— De que sea albarda o jaez —dijo el cura— no está en más de decirlo el
señor don Quijote; que en estas cosas de la caballería todos estos señores
y yo le damos la ventaja.
— Por Dios, señores míos —dijo don Quijote—, que son tantas y tan estrañas
las cosas que en este castillo, en dos veces que en él he alojado, me han
sucedido, que no me atreva a decir afirmativamente ninguna cosa de lo que
acerca de lo que en él se contiene se preguntare, porque imagino que cuanto
en él se trata va por vía de encantamento. La primera vez me fatigó mucho
un moro encantado que en él hay, y a Sancho no le fue muy bien con otros
sus secuaces; y anoche estuve colgado deste brazo casi dos horas, sin saber
cómo ni cómo no vine a caer en aquella desgracia. Así que, ponerme yo agora
en cosa de tanta confusión a dar mi parecer, será caer en juicio temerario.
En lo que toca a lo que dicen que ésta es bacía, y no yelmo, ya yo tengo
respondido; pero, en lo de declarar si ésa es albarda o jaez, no me atrevo
a dar sentencia difinitiva: sólo lo dejo al buen parecer de vuestras
mercedes. Quizá por no ser armados caballeros, como yo lo soy, no tendrán
que ver con vuestras mercedes los encantamentos deste lugar, y tendrán los
entendimientos libres, y podrán juzgar de las cosas deste castillo como
ellas son real y verdaderamente, y no como a mí me parecían.
— No hay duda —respondió a esto don Fernando—, sino que el señor don Quijote
ha dicho muy bien hoy que a nosotros toca la difinición deste caso; y,
porque vaya con más fundamento, yo tomaré en secreto los votos destos
señores, y de lo que resultare daré entera y clara noticia.
Para aquellos que la tenían del humor de don Quijote, era todo esto materia
de grandísima risa; pero, para los que le ignoraban, les parecía el mayor
disparate del mundo, especialmente a los cuatro criados de don Luis, y a
don Luis ni más ni menos, y a otros tres pasajeros que acaso habían llegado
a la venta, que tenían parecer de ser cuadrilleros, como, en efeto, lo
eran. Pero el que más se desesperaba era el barbero, cuya bacía, allí
delante de sus ojos, se le había vuelto en yelmo de Mambrino, y cuya
albarda pensaba sin duda alguna que se le había de volver en jaez rico de
caballo; y los unos y los otros se reían de ver cómo andaba don Fernando
tomando los votos de unos en otros, hablándolos al oído para que en secreto
declarasen si era albarda o jaez aquella joya sobre quien tanto se había
peleado. Y, después que hubo tomado los votos de aquellos que a don Quijote
conocían, dijo en alta voz:
— El caso es, buen hombre, que ya yo estoy cansado de tomar tantos
pareceres, porque veo que a ninguno pregunto lo que deseo saber que no me
diga que es disparate el decir que ésta sea albarda de jumento, sino jaez
de caballo, y aun de caballo castizo; y así, habréis de tener paciencia,
porque, a vuestro pesar y al de vuestro asno, éste es jaez y no albarda, y
vos habéis alegado y probado muy mal de vuestra parte.
— No la tenga yo en el cielo —dijo el sobrebarbero— si todos vuestras
mercedes no se engañan, y que así parezca mi ánima ante Dios como ella me
parece a mí albarda, y no jaez; pero allá van leyes..., etcétera; y no digo
más; y en verdad que no estoy borracho: que no me he desayunado, si de
pecar no.
No menos causaban risa las necedades que decía el barbero que los
disparates de don Quijote, el cual a esta sazón dijo:
— Aquí no hay más que hacer, sino que cada uno tome lo que es suyo, y a
quien Dios se la dio, San Pedro se la bendiga.
Uno de los cuatro dijo:
— Si ya no es que esto sea burla pesada, no me puedo persuadir que hombres
de tan buen entendimiento como son, o parecen, todos los que aquí están, se
atrevan a decir y afirmar que ésta no es bacía, ni aquélla albarda; mas,
como veo que lo afirman y lo dicen, me doy a entender que no carece de
misterio el porfiar una cosa tan contraria de lo que nos muestra la misma
verdad y la misma experiencia; porque, ¡voto a tal! —y arrojóle redondo—,
que no me den a mí a entender cuantos hoy viven en el mundo al revés de que
ésta no sea bacía de barbero y ésta albarda de asno.
— Bien podría ser de borrica —dijo el cura.
— Tanto monta —dijo el criado—, que el caso no consiste en eso, sino en si
es o no es albarda, como vuestras mercedes dicen.
Oyendo esto uno de los cuadrilleros que habían entrado, que había oído la
pendencia y quistión, lleno de cólera y de enfado, dijo:
— Tan albarda es como mi padre; y el que otra cosa ha dicho o dijere debe de
estar hecho uva.
— Mentís como bellaco villano —respondió don Quijote.
Y, alzando el lanzón, que nunca le dejaba de las manos, le iba a descargar
tal golpe sobre la cabeza, que, a no desviarse el cuadrillero, se le dejara
allí tendido. El lanzón se hizo pedazos en el suelo, y los demás
cuadrilleros, que vieron tratar mal a su compañero, alzaron la voz pidiendo
favor a la Santa Hermandad.
El ventero, que era de la cuadrilla, entró al punto por su varilla y por su
espada, y se puso al lado de sus compañeros; los criados de don Luis
rodearon a don Luis, porque con el alboroto no se les fuese; el barbero,
viendo la casa revuelta, tornó a asir de su albarda, y lo mismo hizo
Sancho; don Quijote puso mano a su espada y arremetió a los cuadrilleros.
Don Luis daba voces a sus criados que le dejasen a él y acorriesen a don
Quijote, y a Cardenio, y a don Fernando, que todos favorecían a don
Quijote. El cura daba voces, la ventera gritaba, su hija se afligía,
Maritornes lloraba, Dorotea estaba confusa, Luscinda suspensa y doña Clara
desmayada. El barbero aporreaba a Sancho, Sancho molía al barbero; don
Luis, a quien un criado suyo se atrevió a asirle del brazo porque no se
fuese, le dio una puñada que le bañó los dientes en sangre; el oidor le
defendía, don Fernando tenía debajo de sus pies a un cuadrillero,
midiéndole el cuerpo con ellos muy a su sabor. El ventero tornó a reforzar
la voz, pidiendo favor a la Santa Hermandad: de modo que toda la venta era
llantos, voces, gritos, confusiones, temores, sobresaltos, desgracias,
cuchilladas, mojicones, palos, coces y efusión de sangre. Y, en la mitad
deste caos, máquina y laberinto de cosas, se le representó en la memoria de
don Quijote que se veía metido de hoz y de coz en la discordia del campo de
Agramante; y así dijo, con voz que atronaba la venta:
— ¡Ténganse todos; todos envainen; todos se sosieguen; óiganme todos, si
todos quieren quedar con vida!
A cuya gran voz, todos se pararon, y él prosiguió diciendo:
— ¿No os dije yo, señores, que este castillo era encantado, y que alguna
región de demonios debe de habitar en él? En confirmación de lo cual,
quiero que veáis por vuestros ojos cómo se ha pasado aquí y trasladado
entre nosotros la discordia del campo de Agramante. Mirad cómo allí se
pelea por la espada, aquí por el caballo, acullá por el águila, acá por el
yelmo, y todos peleamos, y todos no nos entendemos. Venga, pues, vuestra
merced, señor oidor, y vuestra merced, señor cura, y el uno sirva de rey
Agramante, y el otro de rey Sobrino, y pónganos en paz; porque por Dios
Todopoderoso que es gran bellaquería que tanta gente principal como aquí
estamos se mate por causas tan livianas.
Los cuadrilleros, que no entendían el frasis de don Quijote, y se veían
malparados de don Fernando, Cardenio y sus camaradas, no querían sosegarse;
el barbero sí, porque en la pendencia tenía deshechas las barbas y el
albarda; Sancho, a la más mínima voz de su amo, obedeció como buen criado;
los cuatro criados de don Luis también se estuvieron quedos, viendo cuán
poco les iba en no estarlo. Sólo el ventero porfiaba que se habían de
castigar las insolencias de aquel loco, que a cada paso le alborotaba la
venta. Finalmente, el rumor se apaciguó por entonces, la albarda se quedó
por jaez hasta el día del juicio, y la bacía por yelmo y la venta por
castillo en la imaginación de don Quijote.
Puestos, pues, ya en sosiego, y hechos amigos todos a persuasión del oidor
y del cura, volvieron los criados de don Luis a porfiarle que al momento se
viniese con ellos; y, en tanto que él con ellos se avenía, el oidor
comunicó con don Fernando, Cardenio y el cura qué debía hacer en aquel
caso, contándoseles con las razones que don Luis le había dicho. En fin,
fue acordado que don Fernando dijese a los criados de don Luis quién él era
y cómo era su gusto que don Luis se fuese con él al Andalucía, donde de su
hermano el marqués sería estimado como el valor de don Luis merecía; porque
desta manera se sabía de la intención de don Luis que no volvería por
aquella vez a los ojos de su padre, si le hiciesen pedazos. Entendida,
pues, de los cuatro la calidad de don Fernando y la intención de don Luis,
determinaron entre ellos que los tres se volviesen a contar lo que pasaba a
su padre, y el otro se quedase a servir a don Luis, y a no dejalle hasta
que ellos volviesen por él, o viese lo que su padre les ordenaba.
Desta manera se apaciguó aquella máquina de pendencias, por la autoridad de
Agramante y prudencia del rey Sobrino; pero, viéndose el enemigo de la
concordia y el émulo de la paz menospreciado y burlado, y el poco fruto que
había granjeado de haberlos puesto a todos en tan confuso laberinto, acordó
de probar otra vez la mano, resucitando nuevas pendencias y desasosiegos.
Es, pues, el caso que los cuadrilleros se sosegaron, por haber entreoído la
calidad de los que con ellos se habían combatido, y se retiraron de la
pendencia, por parecerles que, de cualquiera manera que sucediese, habían
de llevar lo peor de la batalla; pero uno dellos, que fue el que fue molido
y pateado por don Fernando, le vino a la memoria que, entre algunos
mandamientos que traía para prender a algunos delincuentes, traía uno
contra don Quijote, a quien la Santa Hermandad había mandado prender, por
la libertad que dio a los galeotes, y como Sancho, con mucha razón, había
temido.
Imaginando, pues, esto, quiso certificarse si las señas que de don Quijote
traía venían bien, y, sacando del seno un pergamino, topó con el que
buscaba; y, poniéndosele a leer de espacio, porque no era buen lector, a
cada palabra que leía ponía los ojos en don Quijote, y iba cotejando las
señas del mandamiento con el rostro de don Quijote, y halló que, sin duda
alguna, era el que el mandamiento rezaba. Y, apenas se hubo certificado,
cuando, recogiendo su pergamino, en la izquierda tomó el mandamiento, y con
la derecha asió a don Quijote del cuello fuertemente, que no le dejaba
alentar, y a grandes voces decía:
— ¡Favor a la Santa Hermandad! Y, para que se vea que lo pido de veras,
léase este mandamiento, donde se contiene que se prenda a este salteador de
caminos.
Tomó el mandamiento el cura, y vio como era verdad cuanto el cuadrillero
decía, y cómo convenía con las señas con don Quijote; el cual, viéndose
tratar mal de aquel villano malandrín, puesta la cólera en su punto y
crujiéndole los huesos de su cuerpo, como mejor pudo él, asió al
cuadrillero con entrambas manos de la garganta, que, a no ser socorrido de
sus compañeros, allí dejara la vida antes que don Quijote la presa. El
ventero, que por fuerza había de favorecer a los de su oficio, acudió luego
a dalle favor. La ventera, que vio de nuevo a su marido en pendencias, de
nuevo alzó la voz, cuyo tenor le llevaron luego Maritornes y su hija,
pidiendo favor al cielo y a los que allí estaban. Sancho dijo, viendo lo
que pasaba:
— ¡Vive el Señor, que es verdad cuanto mi amo dice de los encantos deste
castillo, pues no es posible vivir una hora con quietud en él!
Don Fernando despartió al cuadrillero y a don Quijote, y, con gusto de
entrambos, les desenclavijó las manos, que el uno en el collar del sayo del
uno, y el otro en la garganta del otro, bien asidas tenían; pero no por
esto cesaban los cuadrilleros de pedir su preso, y que les ayudasen a
dársele atado y entregado a toda su voluntad, porque así convenía al
servicio del rey y de la Santa Hermandad, de cuya parte de nuevo les pedían
socorro y favor para hacer aquella prisión de aquel robador y salteador de
sendas y de carreras. Reíase de oír decir estas razones don Quijote; y, con
mucho sosiego, dijo:
— Venid acá, gente soez y malnacida: ¿saltear de caminos llamáis al dar
libertad a los encadenados, soltar los presos, acorrer a los miserables,
alzar los caídos, remediar los menesterosos? ¡Ah gente infame, digna por
vuestro bajo y vil entendimiento que el cielo no os comunique el valor que
se encierra en la caballería andante, ni os dé a entender el pecado e
ignorancia en que estáis en no reverenciar la sombra, cuanto más la
asistencia, de cualquier caballero andante! Venid acá, ladrones en
cuadrilla, que no cuadrilleros, salteadores de caminos con licencia de la
Santa Hermandad; decidme: ¿quién fue el ignorante que firmó mandamiento de
prisión contra un tal caballero como yo soy? ¿Quién el que ignoró que son
esentos de todo judicial fuero los caballeros andantes, y que su ley es su
espada; sus fueros, sus bríos; sus premáticas, su voluntad? ¿Quién fue el
mentecato, vuelvo a decir, que no sabe que no hay secutoria de hidalgo con
tantas preeminencias, ni esenciones, como la que adquiere un caballero
andante el día que se arma caballero y se entrega al duro ejercicio de la
caballería? ¿Qué caballero andante pagó pecho, alcabala, chapín de la
reina, moneda forera, portazgo ni barca? ¿Qué sastre le llevó hechura de
vestido que le hiciese? ¿Qué castellano le acogió en su castillo que le
hiciese pagar el escote? ¿Qué rey no le asentó a su mesa? ¿Qué doncella no
se le aficionó y se le entregó rendida, a todo su talante y voluntad? Y,
finalmente, ¿qué caballero andante ha habido, hay ni habrá en el mundo, que
no tenga bríos para dar él solo cuatrocientos palos a cuatrocientos
cuadrilleros que se le pongan delante?
Capítulo XLVI. De la notable aventura de los cuadrilleros, y la gran
ferocidad de nuestro buen caballero don Quijote
En tanto que don Quijote esto decía, estaba persuadiendo el cura a los
cuadrilleros como don Quijote era falto de juicio, como lo veían por sus
obras y por sus palabras, y que no tenían para qué llevar aquel negocio
adelante, pues, aunque le prendiesen y llevasen, luego le habían de dejar
por loco; a lo que respondió el del mandamiento que a él no tocaba juzgar
de la locura de don Quijote, sino hacer lo que por su mayor le era mandado,
y que una vez preso, siquiera le soltasen trecientas.
— Con todo eso —dijo el cura—, por esta vez no le habéis de llevar, ni aun
él dejará llevarse, a lo que yo entiendo.
En efeto, tanto les supo el cura decir, y tantas locuras supo don Quijote
hacer, que más locos fueran que no él los cuadrilleros si no conocieran la
falta de don Quijote; y así, tuvieron por bien de apaciguarse, y aun de ser
medianeros de hacer las paces entre el barbero y Sancho Panza, que todavía
asistían con gran rancor a su pendencia. Finalmente, ellos, como miembros
de justicia, mediaron la causa y fueron árbitros della, de tal modo que
ambas partes quedaron, si no del todo contentas, a lo menos en algo
satisfechas, porque se trocaron las albardas, y no las cinchas y jáquimas;
y en lo que tocaba a lo del yelmo de Mambrino, el cura, a socapa y sin que
don Quijote lo entendiese, le dio por la bacía ocho reales, y el barbero le
hizo una cédula del recibo y de no llamarse a engaño por entonces, ni por
siempre jamás amén.
Sosegadas, pues, estas dos pendencias, que eran las más principales y de
más tomo, restaba que los criados de don Luis se contentasen de volver los
tres, y que el uno quedase para acompañarle donde don Fernando le quería
llevar; y, como ya la buena suerte y mejor fortuna había comenzado a romper
lanzas y a facilitar dificultades en favor de los amantes de la venta y de
los valientes della, quiso llevarlo al cabo y dar a todo felice suceso,
porque los criados se contentaron de cuanto don Luis quería; de que recibió
tanto contento doña Clara, que ninguno en aquella sazón la mirara al rostro
que no conociera el regocijo de su alma.
Zoraida, aunque no entendía bien todos los sucesos que había visto, se
entristecía y alegraba a bulto, conforme veía y notaba los semblantes a
cada uno, especialmente de su español, en quien tenía siempre puestos los
ojos y traía colgada el alma. El ventero, a quien no se le pasó por alto
la dádiva y recompensa que el cura había hecho al barbero, pidió el escote
de don Quijote, con el menoscabo de sus cueros y falta de vino, jurando que
no saldría de la venta Rocinante, ni el jumento de Sancho, sin que se le
pagase primero hasta el último ardite. Todo lo apaciguó el cura, y lo pagó
don Fernando, puesto que el oidor, de muy buena voluntad, había también
ofrecido la paga; y de tal manera quedaron todos en paz y sosiego, que ya
no parecía la venta la discordia del campo de Agramante, como don Quijote
había dicho, sino la misma paz y quietud del tiempo de Otaviano; de todo lo
cual fue común opinión que se debían dar las gracias a la buena intención y
mucha elocuencia del señor cura y a la incomparable liberalidad de don
Fernando.
Viéndose, pues, don Quijote libre y desembarazado de tantas pendencias, así
de su escudero como suyas, le pareció que sería bien seguir su comenzado
viaje y dar fin a aquella grande aventura para que había sido llamado y
escogido; y así, con resoluta determinación se fue a poner de hinojos ante
Dorotea, la cual no le consintió que hablase palabra hasta que se
levantase; y él, por obedecella, se puso en pie y le dijo:
— Es común proverbio, fermosa señora, que la diligencia es madre de la buena
ventura, y en muchas y graves cosas ha mostrado la experiencia que la
solicitud del negociante trae a buen fin el pleito dudoso; pero en ningunas
cosas se muestra más esta verdad que en las de la guerra, adonde la
celeridad y presteza previene los discursos del enemigo, y alcanza la
vitoria antes que el contrario se ponga en defensa. Todo esto digo, alta y
preciosa señora, porque me parece que la estada nuestra en este castillo ya
es sin provecho, y podría sernos de tanto daño que lo echásemos de ver
algún día; porque, ¿quién sabe si por ocultas espías y diligentes habrá
sabido ya vuestro enemigo el gigante de que yo voy a destruille?; y,
dándole lugar el tiempo, se fortificase en algún inexpugnable castillo o
fortaleza contra quien valiesen poco mis diligencias y la fuerza de mi
incansable brazo. Así que, señora mía, prevengamos, como tengo dicho, con
nuestra diligencia sus designios, y partámonos luego a la buena ventura;
que no está más de tenerla vuestra grandeza como desea, de cuanto yo tarde
de verme con vuestro contrario.
Calló y no dijo más don Quijote, y esperó con mucho sosiego la respuesta de
la fermosa infanta; la cual, con ademán señoril y acomodado al estilo de
don Quijote, le respondió desta manera:
— Yo os agradezco, señor caballero, el deseo que mostráis tener de
favorecerme en mi gran cuita, bien así como caballero, a quien es anejo y
concerniente favorecer los huérfanos y menesterosos; y quiera el cielo que
el vuestro y mi deseo se cumplan, para que veáis que hay agradecidas
mujeres en el mundo. Y en lo de mi partida, sea luego; que yo no tengo más
voluntad que la vuestra: disponed vos de mí a toda vuestra guisa y talante;
que la que una vez os entregó la defensa de su persona y puso en vuestras
manos la restauración de sus señoríos no ha de querer ir contra lo que la
vuestra prudencia ordenare.
— A la mano de Dios —dijo don Quijote—; pues así es que una señora se me
humilla, no quiero yo perder la ocasión de levantalla y ponella en su
heredado trono. La partida sea luego, porque me va poniendo espuelas al
deseo y al camino lo que suele decirse que en la tardanza está el peligro.
Y, pues no ha criado el cielo, ni visto el infierno, ninguno que me espante
ni acobarde, ensilla, Sancho, a Rocinante, y apareja tu jumento y el
palafrén de la reina, y despidámonos del castellano y destos señores, y
vamos de aquí luego al punto.
Sancho, que a todo estaba presente, dijo, meneando la cabeza a una parte y
a otra:
— ¡Ay señor, señor, y cómo hay más mal en el aldegüela que se suena, con
perdón sea dicho de las tocadas honradas!
— ¿Qué mal puede haber en ninguna aldea, ni en todas las ciudades del mundo,
que pueda sonarse en menoscabo mío, villano?
— Si vuestra merced se enoja —respondió Sancho—, yo callaré, y dejaré de
decir lo que soy obligado como buen escudero, y como debe un buen criado
decir a su señor.
— Di lo que quisieres —replicó don Quijote—, como tus palabras no se
encaminen a ponerme miedo; que si tú le tienes, haces como quien eres, y si
yo no le tengo, hago como quien soy.
— No es eso, ¡pecador fui yo a Dios! —respondió Sancho—, sino que yo tengo
por cierto y por averiguado que esta señora que se dice ser reina del gran
reino Micomicón no lo es más que mi madre; porque, a ser lo que ella dice,
no se anduviera hocicando con alguno de los que están en la rueda, a vuelta
de cabeza y a cada traspuesta.
Paróse colorada con las razones de Sancho Dorotea, porque era verdad que su
esposo don Fernando, alguna vez, a hurto de otros ojos, había cogido con
los labios parte del premio que merecían sus deseos (lo cual había visto
Sancho, y pareciéndole que aquella desenvoltura más era de dama cortesana
que de reina de tan gran reino), y no pudo ni quiso responder palabra a
Sancho, sino dejóle proseguir en su plática, y él fue diciendo:
— Esto digo, señor, porque, si al cabo de haber andado caminos y carreras, y
pasado malas noches y peores días, ha de venir a coger el fruto de nuestros
trabajos el que se está holgando en esta venta, no hay para qué darme
priesa a que ensille a Rocinante, albarde el jumento y aderece al palafrén,
pues será mejor que nos estemos quedos, y cada puta hile, y comamos.
¡Oh, válame Dios, y cuán grande que fue el enojo que recibió don Quijote,
oyendo las descompuestas palabras de su escudero! Digo que fue tanto, que,
con voz atropellada y tartamuda lengua, lanzando vivo fuego por los ojos,
dijo:
— ¡Oh bellaco villano, mal mirado, descompuesto, ignorante, infacundo,
deslenguado, atrevido, murmurador y maldiciente! ¿Tales palabras has osado
decir en mi presencia y en la destas ínclitas señoras, y tales
deshonestidades y atrevimientos osaste poner en tu confusa imaginación?
¡Vete de mi presencia, monstruo de naturaleza, depositario de mentiras,
almario de embustes, silo de bellaquerías, inventor de maldades, publicador
de sandeces, enemigo del decoro que se debe a las reales personas! ¡Vete;
no parezcas delante de mí, so pena de mi ira!
Y, diciendo esto, enarcó las cejas, hinchó los carrillos, miró a todas
partes, y dio con el pie derecho una gran patada en el suelo, señales todas
de la ira que encerraba en sus entrañas. A cuyas palabras y furibundos
ademanes quedó Sancho tan encogido y medroso, que se holgara que en aquel
instante se abriera debajo de sus pies la tierra y le tragara. Y no supo
qué hacerse, sino volver las espaldas y quitarse de la enojada presencia de
su señor. Pero la discreta Dorotea, que tan entendido tenía ya el humor de
don Quijote, dijo, para templarle la ira:
— No os despechéis, señor Caballero de la Triste Figura, de las sandeces que
vuestro buen escudero ha dicho, porque quizá no las debe de decir sin
ocasión, ni de su buen entendimiento y cristiana conciencia se puede
sospechar que levante testimonio a nadie; y así, se ha de creer, sin poner
duda en ello, que, como en este castillo, según vos, señor caballero,
decís, todas las cosas van y suceden por modo de encantamento, podría ser,
digo, que Sancho hubiese visto por esta diabólica vía lo que él dice que
vio, tan en ofensa de mi honestidad.
— Por el omnipotente Dios juro —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, que la
vuestra grandeza ha dado en el punto, y que alguna mala visión se le puso
delante a este pecador de Sancho, que le hizo ver lo que fuera imposible
verse de otro modo que por el de encantos no fuera; que sé yo bien de la
bondad e inocencia deste desdichado, que no sabe levantar testimonios a
nadie.
— Ansí es y ansí será —dijo don Fernando—; por lo cual debe vuestra merced,
señor don Quijote, perdonalle y reducille al gremio de su gracia, sicut
erat in principio, antes que las tales visiones le sacasen de juicio.
Don Quijote respondió que él le perdonaba, y el cura fue por Sancho, el
cual vino muy humilde, y, hincándose de rodillas, pidió la mano a su amo; y
él se la dio, y, después de habérsela dejado besar, le echó la bendición,
diciendo:
— Agora acabarás de conocer, Sancho hijo, ser verdad lo que yo otras muchas
veces te he dicho de que todas las cosas deste castillo son hechas por vía
de encantamento.
— Así lo creo yo —dijo Sancho—, excepto aquello de la manta, que realmente
sucedió por vía ordinaria.
— No lo creas —respondió don Quijote—; que si así fuera, yo te vengara
entonces, y aun agora; pero ni entonces ni agora pude ni vi en quién tomar
venganza de tu agravio.
Desearon saber todos qué era aquello de la manta, y el ventero lo contó,
punto por punto: la volatería de Sancho Panza, de que no poco se rieron
todos; y de que no menos se corriera Sancho, si de nuevo no le asegurara su
amo que era encantamento; puesto que jamás llegó la sandez de Sancho a
tanto, que creyese no ser verdad pura y averiguada, sin mezcla de engaño
alguno, lo de haber sido manteado por personas de carne y hueso, y no por
fantasmas soñadas ni imaginadas, como su señor lo creía y lo afirmaba.
Dos días eran ya pasados los que había que toda aquella ilustre compañía
estaba en la venta; y, pareciéndoles que ya era tiempo de partirse, dieron
orden para que, sin ponerse al trabajo de volver Dorotea y don Fernando con
don Quijote a su aldea, con la invención de la libertad de la reina
Micomicona, pudiesen el cura y el barbero llevársele, como deseaban, y
procurar la cura de su locura en su tierra. Y lo que ordenaron fue que se
concertaron con un carretero de bueyes que acaso acertó a pasar por allí,
para que lo llevase en esta forma: hicieron una como jaula de palos
enrejados, capaz que pudiese en ella caber holgadamente don Quijote; y
luego don Fernando y sus camaradas, con los criados de don Luis y los
cuadrilleros, juntamente con el ventero, todos por orden y parecer del
cura, se cubrieron los rostros y se disfrazaron, quién de una manera y
quién de otra, de modo que a don Quijote le pareciese ser otra gente de la
que en aquel castillo había visto.
Hecho esto, con grandísimo silencio se entraron adonde él estaba durmiendo
y descansando de las pasadas refriegas. Llegáronse a él, que libre y seguro
de tal acontecimiento dormía, y, asiéndole fuertemente, le ataron muy bien
las manos y los pies, de modo que, cuando él despertó con sobresalto, no
pudo menearse, ni hacer otra cosa más que admirarse y suspenderse de ver
delante de sí tan estraños visajes; y luego dio en la cuenta de lo que su
continua y desvariada imaginación le representaba, y se creyó que todas
aquellas figuras eran fantasmas de aquel encantado castillo, y que, sin
duda alguna, ya estaba encantado, pues no se podía menear ni defender: todo
a punto como había pensado que sucedería el cura, trazador desta máquina.
Sólo Sancho, de todos los presentes, estaba en su mesmo juicio y en su
mesma figura; el cual, aunque le faltaba bien poco para tener la mesma
enfermedad de su amo, no dejó de conocer quién eran todas aquellas
contrahechas figuras; mas no osó descoser su boca, hasta ver en qué paraba
aquel asalto y prisión de su amo, el cual tampoco hablaba palabra,
atendiendo a ver el paradero de su desgracia; que fue que, trayendo allí la
jaula, le encerraron dentro, y le clavaron los maderos tan fuertemente que
no se pudieran romper a dos tirones.
Tomáronle luego en hombros, y, al salir del aposento, se oyó una voz
temerosa, todo cuanto la supo formar el barbero, no el del albarda, sino el
otro, que decía:
— ¡Oh Caballero de la Triste Figura!, no te dé afincamiento la prisión en
que vas, porque así conviene para acabar más presto la aventura en que tu
gran esfuerzo te puso; la cual se acabará cuando el furibundo león manchado
con la blanca paloma tobosina yoguieren en uno, ya después de
humilladas las altas cervices al blando yugo matrimoñesco; de cuyo inaudito
consorcio saldrán a la luz del orbe los bravos cachorros, que imitarán las
rumpantes garras del valeroso padre. Y esto será antes que el seguidor de
la fugitiva ninfa faga dos vegadas la visita de las lucientes imágines con
su rápido y natural curso. Y tú, ¡oh, el más noble y obediente escudero que
tuvo espada en cinta, barbas en rostro y olfato en las narices!, no te
desmaye ni descontente ver llevar ansí delante de tus ojos mesmos a la flor
de la caballería andante; que presto, si al plasmador del mundo le place,
te verás tan alto y tan sublimado que no te conozcas, y no saldrán
defraudadas las promesas que te ha fecho tu buen señor. Y asegúrote, de
parte de la sabia Mentironiana, que tu salario te sea pagado, como lo verás
por la obra; y sigue las pisadas del valeroso y encantado caballero, que
conviene que vayas donde paréis entrambos. Y, porque no me es lícito decir
otra cosa, a Dios quedad, que yo me vuelvo adonde yo me sé.
Y, al acabar de la profecía, alzó la voz de punto, y diminuyóla después,
con tan tierno acento, que aun los sabidores de la burla estuvieron por
creer que era verdad lo que oían.
Quedó don Quijote consolado con la escuchada profecía, porque luego coligió
de todo en todo la significación de ella; y vio que le prometían el verse
ayuntados en santo y debido matrimonio con su querida Dulcinea del Toboso,
de cuyo felice vientre saldrían los cachorros, que eran sus hijos, para
gloria perpetua de la Mancha. Y, creyendo esto bien y firmemente, alzó la
voz, y, dando un gran suspiro, dijo:
— ¡Oh tú, quienquiera que seas, que tanto bien me has pronosticado!, ruégote
que pidas de mi parte al sabio encantador que mis cosas tiene a cargo, que
no me deje perecer en esta prisión donde agora me llevan, hasta ver
cumplidas tan alegres e incomparables promesas como son las que aquí se me
han hecho; que, como esto sea, tendré por gloria las penas de mi cárcel, y
por alivio estas cadenas que me ciñen, y no por duro campo de batalla este
lecho en que me acuestan, sino por cama blanda y tálamo dichoso. Y, en lo
que toca a la consolación de Sancho Panza, mi escudero, yo confío de su
bondad y buen proceder que no me dejará en buena ni en mala suerte; porque,
cuando no suceda, por la suya o por mi corta ventura, el poderle yo dar la
ínsula, o otra cosa equivalente que le tengo prometida, por lo menos su
salario no podrá perderse; que en mi testamento, que ya está hecho, dejo
declarado lo que se le ha de dar, no conforme a sus muchos y buenos
servicios, sino a la posibilidad mía.
Sancho Panza se le inclinó con mucho comedimiento, y le besó entrambas las
manos, porque la una no pudiera, por estar atadas entrambas.
Luego tomaron la jaula en hombros aquellas visiones, y la acomodaron en el
carro de los bueyes.
Capítulo XLVII. Del estraño modo con que fue encantado don Quijote de la
Mancha, con otros famosos sucesos
Cuando don Quijote se vio de aquella manera enjaulado y encima del carro,
dijo:
— Muchas y muy graves historias he yo leído de caballeros andantes, pero
jamás he leído, ni visto, ni oído, que a los caballeros encantados los
lleven desta manera y con el espacio que prometen estos perezosos y tardíos
animales; porque siempre los suelen llevar por los aires, con estraña
ligereza, encerrados en alguna parda y escura nube, o en algún carro de
fuego, o ya sobre algún hipogrifo o otra bestia semejante; pero que me
lleven a mí agora sobre un carro de bueyes, ¡vive Dios que me pone en
confusión! Pero quizá la caballería y los encantos destos nuestros tiempos
deben de seguir otro camino que siguieron los antiguos. Y también podría
ser que, como yo soy nuevo caballero en el mundo, y el primero que ha
resucitado el ya olvidado ejercicio de la caballería aventurera, también
nuevamente se hayan inventado otros géneros de encantamentos y otros modos
de llevar a los encantados. ¿Qué te parece desto, Sancho hijo?
— No sé yo lo que me parece —respondió Sancho—, por no ser tan leído como
vuestra merced en las escrituras andantes; pero, con todo eso, osaría
afirmar y jurar que estas visiones que por aquí andan, que no son del todo
católicas.
— ¿Católicas? ¡Mi padre! —respondió don Quijote—. ¿Cómo han de ser católicas
si son todos demonios que han tomado cuerpos fantásticos para venir a hacer
esto y a ponerme en este estado? Y si quieres ver esta verdad, tócalos y
pálpalos, y verás como no tienen cuerpo sino de aire, y como no consiste
más de en la apariencia.
— Par Dios, señor —replicó Sancho—, ya yo los he tocado; y este diablo que
aquí anda tan solícito es rollizo de carnes, y tiene otra propiedad muy
diferente de la que yo he oído decir que tienen los demonios; porque, según
se dice, todos huelen a piedra azufre y a otros malos olores; pero éste
huele a ámbar de media legua.
Decía esto Sancho por don Fernando, que, como tan señor, debía de oler a lo
que Sancho decía.
— No te maravilles deso, Sancho amigo —respondió don Quijote—, porque te
hago saber que los diablos saben mucho, y, puesto que traigan olores
consigo, ellos no huelen nada, porque son espíritus, y si huelen, no pueden
oler cosas buenas, sino malas y hidiondas. Y la razón es que como ellos,
dondequiera que están, traen el infierno consigo, y no pueden recebir
género de alivio alguno en sus tormentos, y el buen olor sea cosa que
deleita y contenta, no es posible que ellos huelan cosa buena. Y si a ti te
parece que ese demonio que dices huele a ámbar, o tú te engañas, o él
quiere engañarte con hacer que no le tengas por demonio.
Todos estos coloquios pasaron entre amo y criado; y, temiendo don Fernando
y Cardenio que Sancho no viniese a caer del todo en la cuenta de su
invención, a quien andaba ya muy en los alcances, determinaron de abreviar
con la partida; y, llamando aparte al ventero, le ordenaron que ensillase a
Rocinante y enalbardase el jumento de Sancho; el cual lo hizo con mucha
presteza.
Ya en esto, el cura se había concertado con los cuadrilleros que le
acompañasen hasta su lugar, dándoles un tanto cada día. Colgó Cardenio del
arzón de la silla de Rocinante, del un cabo la adarga y del otro la bacía,
y por señas mandó a Sancho que subiese en su asno y tomase de las riendas
a Rocinante, y puso a los dos lados del carro a los dos cuadrilleros con
sus escopetas. Pero, antes que se moviese el carro, salió la ventera, su
hija y Maritornes a despedirse de don Quijote, fingiendo que lloraban de
dolor de su desgracia; a quien don Quijote dijo:
— No lloréis, mis buenas señoras, que todas estas desdichas son anexas a los
que profesan lo que yo profeso; y si estas calamidades no me acontecieran,
no me tuviera yo por famoso caballero andante; porque a los caballeros de
poco nombre y fama nunca les suceden semejantes casos, porque no hay en el
mundo quien se acuerde dellos. A los valerosos sí, que tienen envidiosos de
su virtud y valentía a muchos príncipes y a muchos otros caballeros, que
procuran por malas vías destruir a los buenos. Pero, con todo eso, la
virtud es tan poderosa que, por sí sola, a pesar de toda la nigromancia que
supo su primer inventor, Zoroastes, saldrá vencedora de todo trance, y dará
de sí luz en el mundo, como la da el sol en el cielo. Perdonadme, fermosas
damas, si algún desaguisado, por descuido mío, os he fecho, que, de
voluntad y a sabiendas, jamás le di a nadie; y rogad a Dios me saque destas
prisiones, donde algún mal intencionado encantador me ha puesto; que si de
ellas me veo libre, no se me caerá de la memoria las mercedes que en este
castillo me habedes fecho, para gratificallas, servillas y recompensallas
como ellas merecen.
En tanto que las damas del castillo esto pasaban con don Quijote, el cura y
el barbero se despidieron de don Fernando y sus camaradas, y del capitán y
de su hermano y todas aquellas contentas señoras, especialmente de Dorotea
y Luscinda. Todos se abrazaron y quedaron de darse noticia de sus sucesos,
diciendo don Fernando al cura dónde había de escribirle para avisarle en lo
que paraba don Quijote, asegurándole que no habría cosa que más gusto le
diese que saberlo; y que él, asimesmo, le avisaría de todo aquello que él
viese que podría darle gusto, así de su casamiento como del bautismo de
Zoraida, y suceso de don Luis, y vuelta de Luscinda a su casa. El cura
ofreció de hacer cuanto se le mandaba, con toda puntualidad. Tornaron a
abrazarse otra vez, y otra vez tornaron a nuevos ofrecimientos.
El ventero se llegó al cura y le dio unos papeles, diciéndole que los había
hallado en un aforro de la maleta donde se halló la Novela del curioso
impertinente, y que, pues su dueño no había vuelto más por allí, que se los
llevase todos; que, pues él no sabía leer, no los quería. El cura se lo
agradeció, y, abriéndolos luego, vio que al principio de lo escrito decía:
Novela de Rinconete y Cortadillo, por donde entendió ser alguna novela y
coligió que, pues la del Curioso impertinente había sido buena, que también
lo sería aquélla, pues podría ser fuesen todas de un mesmo autor; y así, la
guardó, con prosupuesto de leerla cuando tuviese comodidad.
Subió a caballo, y también su amigo el barbero, con sus antifaces, porque
no fuesen luego conocidos de don Quijote, y pusiéronse a caminar tras el
carro. Y la orden que llevaban era ésta: iba primero el carro, guiándole su
dueño; a los dos lados iban los cuadrilleros, como se ha dicho, con sus
escopetas; seguía luego Sancho Panza sobre su asno, llevando de rienda a
Rocinante. Detrás de todo esto iban el cura y el barbero sobre sus
poderosas mulas, cubiertos los rostros, como se ha dicho, con grave y
reposado continente, no caminando más de lo que permitía el paso tardo de
los bueyes. Don Quijote iba sentado en la jaula, las manos atadas, tendidos
los pies, y arrimado a las verjas, con tanto silencio y tanta paciencia
como si no fuera hombre de carne, sino estatua de piedra.
Y así, con aquel espacio y silencio caminaron hasta dos leguas, que
llegaron a un valle, donde le pareció al boyero ser lugar acomodado para
reposar y dar pasto a los bueyes; y, comunicándolo con el cura, fue de
parecer el barbero que caminasen un poco más, porque él sabía, detrás de un
recuesto que cerca de allí se mostraba, había un valle de más yerba y mucho
mejor que aquel donde parar querían. Tomóse el parecer del barbero, y así,
tornaron a proseguir su camino.
En esto, volvió el cura el rostro, y vio que a sus espaldas venían hasta
seis o siete hombres de a caballo, bien puestos y aderezados, de los cuales
fueron presto alcanzados, porque caminaban no con la flema y reposo de los
bueyes, sino como quien iba sobre mulas de canónigos y con deseo de llegar
presto a sestear a la venta, que menos de una legua de allí se parecía.
Llegaron los diligentes a los perezosos y saludáronse cortésmente; y uno de
los que venían, que, en resolución, era canónigo de Toledo y señor de los
demás que le acompañaban, viendo la concertada procesión del carro,
cuadrilleros, Sancho, Rocinante, cura y barbero, y más a don Quijote,
enjaulado y aprisionado, no pudo dejar de preguntar qué significaba llevar
aquel hombre de aquella manera; aunque ya se había dado a entender, viendo
las insignias de los cuadrilleros, que debía de ser algún facinoroso
salteador, o otro delincuente cuyo castigo tocase a la Santa Hermandad. Uno
de los cuadrilleros, a quien fue hecha la pregunta, respondió ansí:
— Señor, lo que significa ir este caballero desta manera, dígalo él, porque
nosotros no lo sabemos.
Oyó don Quijote la plática, y dijo:
— ¿Por dicha vuestras mercedes, señores caballeros, son versados y perictos
en esto de la caballería andante? Porque si lo son, comunicaré con ellos
mis desgracias, y si no, no hay para qué me canse en decillas.
Y, a este tiempo, habían ya llegado el cura y el barbero, viendo que los
caminantes estaban en pláticas con don Quijote de la Mancha, para responder
de modo que no fuese descubierto su artificio.
El canónigo, a lo que don Quijote dijo, respondió:
— En verdad, hermano, que sé más de libros de caballerías que de las Súmulas
de Villalpando. Ansí que, si no está más que en esto, seguramente podéis
comunicar conmigo lo que quisiéredes.
— A la mano de Dios —replicó don Quijote—. Pues así es, quiero, señor
caballero, que sepades que yo voy encantado en esta jaula, por envidia y
fraude de malos encantadores; que la virtud más es perseguida de los malos
que amada de los buenos. Caballero andante soy, y no de aquellos de cuyos
nombres jamás la Fama se acordó para eternizarlos en su memoria, sino de
aquellos que, a despecho y pesar de la mesma envidia, y de cuantos magos
crió Persia, bracmanes la India, ginosofistas la Etiopía, ha de poner su
nombre en el templo de la inmortalidad para que sirva de ejemplo y dechado
en los venideros siglos, donde los caballeros andantes vean los pasos que
han de seguir, si quisieren llegar a la cumbre y alteza honrosa de las
armas.
— Dice verdad el señor don Quijote de la Mancha —dijo a esta sazón el cura—;
que él va encantado en esta carreta, no por sus culpas y pecados, sino por
la mala intención de aquellos a quien la virtud enfada y la valentía enoja.
Éste es, señor, el Caballero de la Triste Figura, si ya le oístes nombrar
en algún tiempo, cuyas valerosas hazañas y grandes hechos serán escritas
en bronces duros y en eternos mármoles, por más que se canse la envidia en
escurecerlos y la malicia en ocultarlos.
Cuando el canónigo oyó hablar al preso y al libre en semejante estilo,
estuvo por hacerse la cruz, de admirado, y no podía saber lo que le había
acontencido; y en la mesma admiración cayeron todos los que con él venían.
En esto, Sancho Panza, que se había acercado a oír la plática, para
adobarlo todo, dijo:
— Ahora, señores, quiéranme bien o quiéranme mal por lo que dijere, el caso
de ello es que así va encantado mi señor don Quijote como mi madre; él
tiene su entero juicio, él come y bebe y hace sus necesidades como los
demás hombres, y como las hacía ayer, antes que le enjaulasen. Siendo esto
ansí, ¿cómo quieren hacerme a mí entender que va encantado? Pues yo he oído
decir a muchas personas que los encantados ni comen, ni duermen, ni hablan,
y mi amo, si no le van a la mano, hablará más que treinta procuradores.
Y, volviéndose a mirar al cura, prosiguió diciendo:
— ¡Ah señor cura, señor cura! ¿Pensaba vuestra merced que no le conozco, y
pensará que yo no calo y adivino adónde se encaminan estos nuevos
encantamentos? Pues sepa que le conozco, por más que se encubra el rostro,
y sepa que le entiendo, por más que disimule sus embustes. En fin, donde
reina la envidia no puede vivir la virtud, ni adonde hay escaseza la
liberalidad. !Mal haya el diablo!; que, si por su reverencia no fuera, ésta
fuera ya la hora que mi señor estuviera casado con la infanta Micomicona, y
yo fuera conde, por lo menos, pues no se podía esperar otra cosa, así de la
bondad de mi señor el de la Triste Figura como de la grandeza de mis
servicios. Pero ya veo que es verdad lo que se dice por ahí: que la rueda
de la Fortuna anda más lista que una rueda de molino, y que los que ayer
estaban en pinganitos hoy están por el suelo. De mis hijos y de mi mujer me
pesa, pues cuando podían y debían esperar ver entrar a su padre por sus
puertas hecho gobernador o visorrey de alguna ínsula o reino, le verán
entrar hecho mozo de caballos. Todo esto que he dicho, señor cura, no es
más de por encarecer a su paternidad haga conciencia del mal tratamiento
que a mi señor se le hace, y mire bien no le pida Dios en la otra vida esta
prisión de mi amo, y se le haga cargo de todos aquellos socorros y bienes
que mi señor don Quijote deja de hacer en este tiempo que está preso.
— ¡Adóbame esos candiles! —dijo a este punto el barbero—. ¿También vos,
Sancho, sois de la cofradía de vuestro amo? ¡Vive el Señor, que voy viendo
que le habéis de tener compañía en la jaula, y que habéis de quedar tan
encantado como él, por lo que os toca de su humor y de su caballería! En
mal punto os empreñastes de sus promesas, y en mal hora se os entró en los
cascos la ínsula que tanto deseáis.
— Yo no estoy preñado de nadie —respondió Sancho—, ni soy hombre que me
dejaría empreñar, del rey que fuese; y, aunque pobre, soy cristiano viejo,
y no debo nada a nadie; y si ínsulas deseo, otros desean otras cosas
peores; y cada uno es hijo de sus obras; y, debajo de ser hombre, puedo
venir a ser papa, cuanto más gobernador de una ínsula, y más pudiendo ganar
tantas mi señor que le falte a quien dallas. Vuestra merced mire cómo
habla, señor barbero; que no es todo hacer barbas, y algo va de Pedro a
Pedro. Dígolo porque todos nos conocemos, y a mí no se me ha de echar dado
falso. Y en esto del encanto de mi amo, Dios sabe la verdad; y quédese
aquí, porque es peor meneallo.
No quiso responder el barbero a Sancho, porque no descubriese con sus
simplicidades lo que él y el cura tanto procuraban encubrir; y, por este
mesmo temor, había el cura dicho al canónigo que caminasen un poco delante:
que él le diría el misterio del enjaulado, con otras cosas que le diesen
gusto. Hízolo así el canónigo, y adelantóse con sus criados y con él:
estuvo atento a todo aquello que decirle quiso de la condición, vida,
locura y costumbres de don Quijote, contándole brevemente el principio y
causa de su desvarío, y todo el progreso de sus sucesos, hasta haberlo
puesto en aquella jaula, y el disignio que llevaban de llevarle a su
tierra, para ver si por algún medio hallaban remedio a su locura.
Admiráronse de nuevo los criados y el canónigo de oír la peregrina historia
de don Quijote, y, en acabándola de oír, dijo:
— Verdaderamente, señor cura, yo hallo por mi cuenta que son perjudiciales
en la república estos que llaman libros de caballerías; y, aunque he leído,
llevado de un ocioso y falso gusto, casi el principio de todos los más que
hay impresos, jamás me he podido acomodar a leer ninguno del principio al
cabo, porque me parece que, cuál más, cuál menos, todos ellos son una mesma
cosa, y no tiene más éste que aquél, ni estotro que el otro. Y, según a mí
me parece, este género de escritura y composición cae debajo de aquel de
las fábulas que llaman milesias, que son cuentos disparatados, que atienden
solamente a deleitar, y no a enseñar: al contrario de lo que hacen las
fábulas apólogas, que deleitan y enseñan juntamente. Y, puesto que el
principal intento de semejantes libros sea el deleitar, no sé yo cómo
puedan conseguirle, yendo llenos de tantos y tan desaforados disparates;
que el deleite que en el alma se concibe ha de ser de la hermosura y
concordancia que vee o contempla en las cosas que la vista o la imaginación
le ponen delante; y toda cosa que tiene en sí fealdad y descompostura no
nos puede causar contento alguno. Pues, ¿qué hermosura puede haber, o qué
proporción de partes con el todo y del todo con las partes, en un libro o
fábula donde un mozo de diez y seis años da una cuchillada a un gigante
como una torre, y le divide en dos mitades, como si fuera de alfeñique; y
que, cuando nos quieren pintar una batalla, después de haber dicho que hay
de la parte de los enemigos un millón de competientes, como sea contra
ellos el señor del libro, forzosamente, mal que nos pese, habemos de
entender que el tal caballero alcanzó la vitoria por solo el valor de su
fuerte brazo? Pues, ¿qué diremos de la facilidad con que una reina o
emperatriz heredera se conduce en los brazos de un andante y no conocido
caballero? ¿Qué ingenio, si no es del todo bárbaro e inculto, podrá
contentarse leyendo que una gran torre llena de caballeros va por la mar
adelante, como nave con próspero viento, y hoy anochece en Lombardía, y
mañana amanezca en tierras del Preste Juan de las Indias, o en otras que ni
las descubrió Tolomeo ni las vio Marco Polo? Y, si a esto se me respondiese
que los que tales libros componen los escriben como cosas de mentira, y que
así, no están obligados a mirar en delicadezas ni verdades, responderles
hía yo que tanto la mentira es mejor cuanto más parece verdadera, y tanto
más agrada cuanto tiene más de lo dudoso y posible. Hanse de casar las
fábulas mentirosas con el entendimiento de los que las leyeren,
escribiéndose de suerte que, facilitando los imposibles, allanando las
grandezas, suspendiendo los ánimos, admiren, suspendan, alborocen y
entretengan, de modo que anden a un mismo paso la admiración y la alegría
juntas; y todas estas cosas no podrá hacer el que huyere de la
verisimilitud y de la imitación, en quien consiste la perfeción de lo que
se escribe. No he visto ningún libro de caballerías que haga un cuerpo de
fábula entero con todos sus miembros, de manera que el medio corresponda al
principio, y el fin al principio y al medio; sino que los componen con
tantos miembros, que más parece que llevan intención a formar una quimera o
un monstruo que a hacer una figura proporcionada. Fuera desto, son en el
estilo duros; en las hazañas, increíbles; en los amores, lascivos; en las
cortesías, mal mirados; largos en las batallas, necios en las razones,
disparatados en los viajes, y, finalmente, ajenos de todo discreto
artificio, y por esto dignos de ser desterrados de la república cristiana,
como a gente inútil.
El cura le estuvo escuchando con grande atención, y parecióle hombre de
buen entendimiento, y que tenía razón en cuanto decía; y así, le dijo que,
por ser él de su mesma opinión y tener ojeriza a los libros de caballerías,
había quemado todos los de don Quijote, que eran muchos. Y contóle el
escrutinio que dellos había hecho, y los que había condenado al fuego y
dejado con vida, de que no poco se rió el canónigo, y dijo que, con todo
cuanto mal había dicho de tales libros, hallaba en ellos una cosa buena:
que era el sujeto que ofrecían para que un buen entendimiento pudiese
mostrarse en ellos, porque daban largo y espacioso campo por donde sin
empacho alguno pudiese correr la pluma, descubriendo naufragios, tormentas,
rencuentros y batallas; pintando un capitán valeroso con todas las partes
que para ser tal se requieren, mostrándose prudente previniendo las
astucias de sus enemigos, y elocuente orador persuadiendo o disuadiendo a
sus soldados, maduro en el consejo, presto en lo determinado, tan valiente
en el esperar como en el acometer; pintando ora un lamentable y trágico
suceso, ahora un alegre y no pensado acontecimiento; allí una hermosísima
dama, honesta, discreta y recatada; aquí un caballero cristiano, valiente y
comedido; acullá un desaforado bárbaro fanfarrón; acá un príncipe cortés,
valeroso y bien mirado; representando bondad y lealtad de vasallos,
grandezas y mercedes de señores. Ya puede mostrarse astrólogo, ya
cosmógrafo excelente, ya músico, ya inteligente en las materias de estado,
y tal vez le vendrá ocasión de mostrarse nigromante, si quisiere. Puede
mostrar las astucias de Ulixes, la piedad de Eneas, la valentía de Aquiles,
las desgracias de Héctor, las traiciones de Sinón, la amistad de Eurialio,
la liberalidad de Alejandro, el valor de César, la clemencia y verdad de
Trajano, la fidelidad de Zopiro, la prudencia de Catón; y, finalmente,
todas aquellas acciones que pueden hacer perfecto a un varón ilustre, ahora
poniéndolas en uno solo, ahora dividiéndolas en muchos.
— Y, siendo esto hecho con apacibilidad de estilo y con ingeniosa invención,
que tire lo más que fuere posible a la verdad, sin duda compondrá una tela
de varios y hermosos lazos tejida, que, después de acabada, tal perfeción y
hermosura muestre, que consiga el fin mejor que se pretende en los
escritos, que es enseñar y deleitar juntamente, como ya tengo dicho. Porque
la escritura desatada destos libros da lugar a que el autor pueda mostrarse
épico, lírico, trágico, cómico, con todas aquellas partes que encierran en
sí las dulcísimas y agradables ciencias de la poesía y de la oratoria; que
la épica también puede escrebirse en prosa como en verso.
Capítulo XLVIII. Donde prosigue el canónigo la materia de los libros de
caballerías, con otras cosas dignas de su ingenio
— Así es como vuestra merced dice, señor canónigo —dijo el cura—, y por esta
causa son más dignos de reprehensión los que hasta aquí han compuesto
semejantes libros sin tener advertencia a ningún buen discurso, ni al arte
y reglas por donde pudieran guiarse y hacerse famosos en prosa, como lo son
en verso los dos príncipes de la poesía griega y latina.
— Yo, a lo menos —replicó el canónigo—, he tenido cierta tentación de hacer
un libro de caballerías, guardando en él todos los puntos que he
significado; y si he de confesar la verdad, tengo escritas más de cien
hojas. Y para hacer la experiencia de si correspondían a mi estimación, las
he comunicado con hombres apasionados desta leyenda, dotos y discretos, y
con otros ignorantes, que sólo atienden al gusto de oír disparates, y de
todos he hallado una agradable aprobación; pero, con todo esto, no he
proseguido adelante, así por parecerme que hago cosa ajena de mi profesión,
como por ver que es más el número de los simples que de los prudentes; y
que, puesto que es mejor ser loado de los pocos sabios que burlado de los
muchos necios, no quiero sujetarme al confuso juicio del desvanecido vulgo,
a quien por la mayor parte toca leer semejantes libros. Pero lo que más me
le quitó de las manos, y aun del pensamiento, de acabarle, fue un argumento
que hice conmigo mesmo, sacado de las comedias que ahora se representa,
diciendo: ''Si estas que ahora se usan, así las imaginadas como las de
historia, todas o las más son conocidos disparates y cosas que no llevan
pies ni cabeza, y, con todo eso, el vulgo las oye con gusto, y las tiene y
las aprueba por buenas, estando tan lejos de serlo, y los autores que las
componen y los actores que las representan dicen que así han de ser, porque
así las quiere el vulgo, y no de otra manera; y que las que llevan traza y
siguen la fábula como el arte pide, no sirven sino para cuatro discretos
que las entienden, y todos los demás se quedan ayunos de entender su
artificio, y que a ellos les está mejor ganar de comer con los muchos, que
no opinión con los pocos, deste modo vendrá a ser un libro, al cabo de
haberme quemado las cejas por guardar los preceptos referidos, y vendré a
ser el sastre del cantillo''. Y, aunque algunas veces he procurado
persuadir a los actores que se engañan en tener la opinión que tienen, y
que más gente atraerán y más fama cobrarán representando comedias que hagan
el arte que no con las disparatadas, y están tan asidos y encorporados en
su parecer, que no hay razón ni evidencia que dél los saque. Acuérdome que
un día dije a uno destos pertinaces: ''Decidme, ¿no os acordáis que ha
pocos años que se representaron en España tres tragedias que compuso un
famoso poeta destos reinos, las cuales fueron tales, que admiraron,
alegraron y suspendieron a todos cuantos las oyeron, así simples como
prudentes, así del vulgo como de los escogidos, y dieron más dineros a los
representantes ellas tres solas que treinta de las mejores que después acá
se han hecho?'' ''Sin duda —respondió el autor que digo—, que debe de decir
vuestra merced por La Isabela, La Filis y La Alejandra''. ''Por ésas digo
— le repliqué yo—; y mirad si guardaban bien los preceptos del arte, y si
por guardarlos dejaron de parecer lo que eran y de agradar a todo el mundo.
Así que no está la falta en el vulgo, que pide disparates, sino en aquellos
que no saben representar otra cosa. Sí, que no fue disparate La ingratitud
vengada, ni le tuvo La Numancia, ni se le halló en la del Mercader amante,
ni menos en La enemiga favorable, ni en otras algunas que de algunos
entendidos poetas han sido compuestas, para fama y renombre suyo, y para
ganancia de los que las han representado''. Y otras cosas añadí a éstas,
con que, a mi parecer, le dejé algo confuso, pero no satisfecho ni
convencido para sacarle de su errado pensamiento.
— En materia ha tocado vuestra merced, señor canónigo —dijo a esta sazón el
cura—, que ha despertado en mí un antiguo rancor que tengo con las comedias
que agora se usan, tal, que iguala al que tengo con los libros de
caballerías; porque, habiendo de ser la comedia, según le parece a Tulio,
espejo de la vida humana, ejemplo de las costumbres y imagen de la verdad,
las que ahora se representan son espejos de disparates, ejemplos de
necedades e imágenes de lascivia. Porque, ¿qué mayor disparate puede ser en
el sujeto que tratamos que salir un niño en mantillas en la primera cena
del primer acto, y en la segunda salir ya hecho hombre barbado? Y ¿qué
mayor que pintarnos un viejo valiente y un mozo cobarde, un lacayo
rectórico, un paje consejero, un rey ganapán y una princesa fregona? ¿Qué
diré, pues, de la observancia que guardan en los tiempos en que pueden o
podían suceder las acciones que representan, sino que he visto comedia que
la primera jornada comenzó en Europa, la segunda en Asia, la tercera se
acabó en Africa, y ansí fuera de cuatro jornadas, la cuarta acababa en
América, y así se hubiera hecho en todas las cuatro partes del mundo? Y si
es que la imitación es lo principal que ha de tener la comedia, ¿cómo es
posible que satisfaga a ningún mediano entendimiento que, fingiendo una
acción que pasa en tiempo del rey Pepino y Carlomagno, el mismo que en ella
hace la persona principal le atribuyan que fue el emperador Heraclio, que
entró con la Cruz en Jerusalén, y el que ganó la Casa Santa, como Godofre
de Bullón, habiendo infinitos años de lo uno a lo otro; y fundándose la
comedia sobre cosa fingida, atribuirle verdades de historia, y mezclarle
pedazos de otras sucedidas a diferentes personas y tiempos, y esto, no con
trazas verisímiles, sino con patentes errores de todo punto inexcusables? Y
es lo malo que hay ignorantes que digan que esto es lo perfecto, y que lo
demás es buscar gullurías. Pues, ¿qué si venimos a las comedias divinas?:
¡qué de milagros falsos fingen en ellas, qué de cosas apócrifas y mal
entendidas, atribuyendo a un santo los milagros de otro! Y aun en las
humanas se atreven a hacer milagros, sin más respeto ni consideración que
parecerles que allí estará bien el tal milagro y apariencia, como ellos
llaman, para que gente ignorante se admire y venga a la comedia; que todo
esto es en perjuicio de la verdad y en menoscabo de las historias, y aun en
oprobrio de los ingenios españoles; porque los estranjeros, que con mucha
puntualidad guardan las leyes de la comedia, nos tienen por bárbaros e
ignorantes, viendo los absurdos y disparates de las que hacemos. Y no sería
bastante disculpa desto decir que el principal intento que las repúblicas
bien ordenadas tienen, permitiendo que se hagan públicas comedias, es para
entretener la comunidad con alguna honesta recreación, y divertirla a veces
de los malos humores que suele engendrar la ociosidad; y que, pues éste se
consigue con cualquier comedia, buena o mala, no hay para qué poner leyes,
ni estrechar a los que las componen y representan a que las hagan como
debían hacerse, pues, como he dicho, con cualquiera se consigue lo que con
ellas se pretende. A lo cual respondería yo que este fin se conseguiría
mucho mejor, sin comparación alguna, con las comedias buenas que con las no
tales; porque, de haber oído la comedia artificiosa y bien ordenada,
saldría el oyente alegre con las burlas, enseñado con las veras, admirado
de los sucesos, discreto con las razones, advertido con los embustes, sagaz
con los ejemplos, airado contra el vicio y enamorado de la virtud; que
todos estos afectos ha de despertar la buena comedia en el ánimo del que la
escuchare, por rústico y torpe que sea; y de toda imposibilidad es
imposible dejar de alegrar y entretener, satisfacer y contentar, la comedia
que todas estas partes tuviere mucho más que aquella que careciere dellas,
como por la mayor parte carecen estas que de ordinario agora se
representan. Y no tienen la culpa desto los poetas que las componen, porque
algunos hay dellos que conocen muy bien en lo que yerran, y saben
estremadamente lo que deben hacer; pero, como las comedias se han hecho
mercadería vendible, dicen, y dicen verdad, que los representantes no se
las comprarían si no fuesen de aquel jaez; y así, el poeta procura
acomodarse con lo que el representante que le ha de pagar su obra le pide.
Y que esto sea verdad véase por muchas e infinitas comedias que ha
compuesto un felicísimo ingenio destos reinos, con tanta gala, con tanto
donaire, con tan elegante verso, con tan buenas razones, con tan graves
sentencias y, finalmente, tan llenas de elocución y alteza de estilo, que
tiene lleno el mundo de su fama. Y, por querer acomodarse al gusto de los
representantes, no han llegado todas, como han llegado algunas, al punto de
la perfección que requieren. Otros las componen tan sin mirar lo que hacen,
que después de representadas tienen necesidad los recitantes de huirse y
ausentarse, temerosos de ser castigados, como lo han sido muchas veces, por
haber representado cosas en perjuicio de algunos reyes y en deshonra de
algunos linajes. Y todos estos inconvinientes cesarían, y aun otros muchos
más que no digo, con que hubiese en la Corte una persona inteligente y
discreta que examinase todas las comedias antes que se representasen (no
sólo aquellas que se hiciesen en la Corte, sino todas las que se quisiesen
representar en España), sin la cual aprobación, sello y firma, ninguna
justicia en su lugar dejase representar comedia alguna; y, desta manera,
los comediantes tendrían cuidado de enviar las comedias a la Corte, y con
seguridad podrían representallas, y aquellos que las componen mirarían con
más cuidado y estudio lo que hacían, temorosos de haber de pasar sus obras
por el riguroso examen de quien lo entiende; y desta manera se harían
buenas comedias y se conseguiría felicísimamente lo que en ellas se
pretende: así el entretenimiento del pueblo, como la opinión de los
ingenios de España, el interés y seguridad de los recitantes y el ahorro
del cuidado de castigallos. Y si diese cargo a otro, o a este mismo, que
examinase los libros de caballerías que de nuevo se compusiesen, sin duda
podrían salir algunos con la perfección que vuestra merced ha dicho,
enriqueciendo nuestra lengua del agradable y precioso tesoro de la
elocuencia, dando ocasión que los libros viejos se escureciesen a la luz de
los nuevos que saliesen, para honesto pasatiempo, no solamente de los
ociosos, sino de los más ocupados; pues no es posible que esté continuo el
arco armado, ni la condición y flaqueza humana se pueda sustentar sin
alguna lícita recreación.
A este punto de su coloquio llegaban el canónigo y el cura, cuando,
adelantándose el barbero, llegó a ellos, y dijo al cura:
— Aquí, señor licenciado, es el lugar que yo dije que era bueno para que,
sesteando nosotros, tuviesen los bueyes fresco y abundoso pasto.
— Así me lo parece a mí —respondió el cura.
Y, diciéndole al canónigo lo que pensaba hacer, él también quiso quedarse
con ellos, convidado del sitio de un hermoso valle que a la vista se les
ofrecía. Y, así por gozar dél como de la conversación del cura, de quien ya
iba aficionado, y por saber más por menudo las hazañas de don Quijote,
mandó a algunos de sus criados que se fuesen a la venta, que no lejos de
allí estaba, y trujesen della lo que hubiese de comer, para todos, porque
él determinaba de sestear en aquel lugar aquella tarde; a lo cual uno de
sus criados respondió que el acémila del repuesto, que ya debía de estar en
la venta, traía recado bastante para no obligar a no tomar de la venta más
que cebada.
— Pues así es —dijo el canónigo—, llévense allá todas las cabalgaduras, y
haced volver la acémila.
En tanto que esto pasaba, viendo Sancho que podía hablar a su amo sin la
continua asistencia del cura y el barbero, que tenía por sospechosos, se
llegó a la jaula donde iba su amo, y le dijo:
— Señor, para descargo de mi conciencia, le quiero decir lo que pasa cerca
de su encantamento; y es que aquestos dos que vienen aquí cubiertos los
rostros son el cura de nuestro lugar y el barbero; y imagino han dado esta
traza de llevalle desta manera, de pura envidia que tienen como vuestra
merced se les adelanta en hacer famosos hechos. Presupuesta, pues, esta
verdad, síguese que no va encantado, sino embaído y tonto. Para prueba de
lo cual le quiero preguntar una cosa; y si me responde como creo que me ha
de responder, tocará con la mano este engaño y verá como no va encantado,
sino trastornado el juicio.
— Pregunta lo que quisieres, hijo Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que yo te
satisfaré y responderé a toda tu voluntad. Y en lo que dices que aquellos
que allí van y vienen con nosotros son el cura y el barbero, nuestros
compatriotos y conocidos, bien podrá ser que parezca que son ellos mesmos;
pero que lo sean realmente y en efeto, eso no lo creas en ninguna manera.
Lo que has de creer y entender es que si ellos se les parecen, como dices,
debe de ser que los que me han encantado habrán tomado esa apariencia y
semejanza; porque es fácil a los encantadores tomar la figura que se les
antoja, y habrán tomado las destos nuestros amigos, para darte a ti ocasión
de que pienses lo que piensas, y ponerte en un laberinto de imaginaciones,
que no aciertes a salir dél, aunque tuvieses la soga de Teseo. Y también lo
habrán hecho para que yo vacile en mi entendimiento, y no sepa atinar de
dónde me viene este daño; porque si, por una parte, tú me dices que me
acompañan el barbero y el cura de nuestro pueblo, y, por otra, yo me veo
enjaulado, y sé de mí que fuerzas humanas, como no fueran sobrenaturales,
no fueran bastantes para enjaularme, ¿qué quieres que diga o piense sino
que la manera de mi encantamento excede a cuantas yo he leído en todas
las historias que tratan de caballeros andantes que han sido encantados?
Ansí que, bien puedes darte paz y sosiego en esto de creer que son los que
dices, porque así son ellos como yo soy turco. Y, en lo que toca a querer
preguntarme algo, di, que yo te responderé, aunque me preguntes de aquí a
mañana.
— ¡Válame Nuestra Señora! —respondió Sancho, dando una gran voz—. Y ¿es
posible que sea vuestra merced tan duro de celebro, y tan falto de meollo,
que no eche de ver que es pura verdad la que le digo, y que en esta su
prisión y desgracia tiene más parte la malicia que el encanto? Pero, pues
así es, yo le quiero probar evidentemente como no va encantado. Si no,
dígame, así Dios le saque desta tormenta, y así se vea en los brazos de mi
señora Dulcinea cuando menos se piense...
— Acaba de conjurarme —dijo don Quijote—, y pregunta lo que quisieres; que
ya te he dicho que te responderé con toda puntualidad.
— Eso pido —replicó Sancho—; y lo que quiero saber es que me diga, sin
añadir ni quitar cosa ninguna, sino con toda verdad, como se espera que la
han de decir y la dicen todos aquellos que profesan las armas, como vuestra
merced las profesa, debajo de título de caballeros andantes...
— Digo que no mentiré en cosa alguna —respondió don Quijote—. Acaba ya de
preguntar, que en verdad que me cansas con tantas salvas, plegarias y
prevenciones, Sancho.
— Digo que yo estoy seguro de la bondad y verdad de mi amo; y así, porque
hace al caso a nuestro cuento, pregunto, hablando con acatamiento, si acaso
después que vuestra merced va enjaulado y, a su parecer, encantado en esta
jaula, le ha venido gana y voluntad de hacer aguas mayores o menores, como
suele decirse.
— No entiendo eso de hacer aguas, Sancho; aclárate más, si quieres que te
responda derechamente.
— ¿Es posible que no entiende vuestra merced de hacer aguas menores o
mayores? Pues en la escuela destetan a los muchachos con ello. Pues sepa
que quiero decir si le ha venido gana de hacer lo que no se escusa.
— ¡Ya, ya te entiendo, Sancho! Y muchas veces; y aun agora la tengo. ¡Sácame
deste peligro, que no anda todo limpio!
Capítulo XLIX. Donde se trata del discreto coloquio que Sancho Panza tuvo
con su señor don Quijote
— ¡Ah —dijo Sancho—; cogido le tengo! Esto es lo que yo deseaba saber, como
al alma y como a la vida. Venga acá, señor: ¿podría negar lo que comúnmente
suele decirse por ahí cuando una persona está de mala voluntad: "No sé qué
tiene fulano, que ni come, ni bebe, ni duerme, ni responde a propósito a lo
que le preguntan, que no parece sino que está encantado"? De donde se viene
a sacar que los que no comen, ni beben, ni duermen, ni hacen las obras
naturales que yo digo, estos tales están encantados; pero no aquellos que
tienen la gana que vuestra merced tiene y que bebe cuando se lo dan, y come
cuando lo tiene, y responde a todo aquello que le preguntan.
— Verdad dices, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, pero ya te he dicho que hay
muchas maneras de encantamentos, y podría ser que con el tiempo se hubiesen
mudado de unos en otros, y que agora se use que los encantados hagan todo
lo que yo hago, aunque antes no lo hacían. De manera que contra el uso de
los tiempos no hay que argüir ni de qué hacer consecuencias. Yo sé y tengo
para mí que voy encantado, y esto me basta para la seguridad de mi
conciencia; que la formaría muy grande si yo pensase que no estaba
encantado y me dejase estar en esta jaula, perezoso y cobarde, defraudando
el socorro que podría dar a muchos menesterosos y necesitados que de mi
ayuda y amparo deben tener a la hora de ahora precisa y estrema necesidad.
— Pues, con todo eso —replicó Sancho—, digo que, para mayor abundancia y
satisfación, sería bien que vuestra merced probase a salir desta cárcel,
que yo me obligo con todo mi poder a facilitarlo, y aun a sacarle della, y
probase de nuevo a subir sobre su buen Rocinante, que también parece que va
encantado, según va de malencólico y triste; y, hecho esto, probásemos otra
vez la suerte de buscar más aventuras; y si no nos sucediese bien, tiempo
nos queda para volvernos a la jaula, en la cual prometo, a ley de buen y
leal escudero, de encerrarme juntamente con vuestra merced, si acaso fuere
vuestra merced tan desdichado, o yo tan simple, que no acierte a salir con
lo que digo.
— Yo soy contento de hacer lo que dices, Sancho hermano —replicó don
Quijote—; y cuando tú veas coyuntura de poner en obra mi libertad, yo te
obedeceré en todo y por todo; pero tú, Sancho, verás como te engañas en el
conocimiento de mi desgracia.
En estas pláticas se entretuvieron el caballero andante y el mal andante
escudero, hasta que llegaron donde, ya apeados, los aguardaban el cura, el
canónigo y el barbero. Desunció luego los bueyes de la carreta el boyero, y
dejólos andar a sus anchuras por aquel verde y apacible sitio, cuya
frescura convidaba a quererla gozar, no a las personas tan encantadas como
don Quijote, sino a los tan advertidos y discretos como su escudero; el
cual rogó al cura que permitiese que su señor saliese por un rato de la
jaula, porque si no le dejaban salir, no iría tan limpia aquella prisión
como requiría la decencia de un tal caballero como su amo. Entendióle el
cura, y dijo que de muy buena gana haría lo que le pedía si no temiera que,
en viéndose su señor en libertad, había de hacer de las suyas, y irse donde
jamás gentes le viesen.
— Yo le fío de la fuga —respondió Sancho.
— Y yo y todo —dijo el canónigo—; y más si él me da la palabra, como
caballero, de no apartarse de nosotros hasta que sea nuestra voluntad.
— Sí doy —respondió don Quijote, que todo lo estaba escuchando—; cuanto más,
que el que está encantado, como yo, no tiene libertad para hacer de su
persona lo que quisiere, porque el que le encantó le puede hacer que no se
mueva de un lugar en tres siglos; y si hubiere huido, le hará volver en
volandas. —Y que, pues esto era así, bien podían soltalle, y más, siendo
tan en provecho de todos; y del no soltalle les protestaba que no podía
dejar de fatigalles el olfato, si de allí no se desviaban.
Tomóle la mano el canónigo, aunque las tenía atadas, y, debajo de su buena
fe y palabra, le desenjaularon, de que él se alegró infinito y en grande
manera de verse fuera de la jaula. Y lo primero que hizo fue estirarse todo
el cuerpo, y luego se fue donde estaba Rocinante, y, dándole dos palmadas
en las ancas, dijo:
— Aún espero en Dios y en su bendita Madre, flor y espejo de los caballos,
que presto nos hemos de ver los dos cual deseamos; tú, con tu señor a
cuestas; y yo, encima de ti, ejercitando el oficio para que Dios me echó al
mundo.
Y, diciendo esto, don Quijote se apartó con Sancho en remota parte, de
donde vino más aliviado y con más deseos de poner en obra lo que su
escudero ordenase.
Mirábalo el canónigo, y admirábase de ver la estrañeza de su grande locura,
y de que, en cuanto hablaba y respondía, mostraba tener bonísimo
entendimiento: solamente venía a perder los estribos, como otras veces se
ha dicho, en tratándole de caballería. Y así, movido de compasión, después
de haberse sentado todos en la verde yerba, para esperar el repuesto del
canónigo, le dijo:
— ¿Es posible, señor hidalgo, que haya podido tanto con vuestra merced la
amarga y ociosa letura de los libros de caballerías, que le hayan vuelto el
juicio de modo que venga a creer que va encantado, con otras cosas deste
jaez, tan lejos de ser verdaderas como lo está la mesma mentira de la
verdad? Y ¿cómo es posible que haya entendimiento humano que se dé a
entender que ha habido en el mundo aquella infinidad de Amadises, y aquella
turbamulta de tanto famoso caballero, tanto emperador de Trapisonda, tanto
Felixmarte de Hircania, tanto palafrén, tanta doncella andante, tantas
sierpes, tantos endriagos, tantos gigantes, tantas inauditas aventuras,
tanto género de encantamentos, tantas batallas, tantos desaforados
encuentros, tanta bizarría de trajes, tantas princesas enamoradas, tantos
escuderos condes, tantos enanos graciosos, tanto billete, tanto requiebro,
tantas mujeres valientes; y, finalmente, tantos y tan disparatados casos
como los libros de caballerías contienen? De mí sé decir que, cuando los
leo, en tanto que no pongo la imaginación en pensar que son todos mentira y
liviandad, me dan algún contento; pero, cuando caigo en la cuenta de lo que
son, doy con el mejor dellos en la pared, y aun diera con él en el fuego si
cerca o presente le tuviera, bien como a merecedores de tal pena, por ser
falsos y embusteros, y fuera del trato que pide la común naturaleza, y como
a inventores de nuevas sectas y de nuevo modo de vida, y como a quien da
ocasión que el vulgo ignorante venga a creer y a tener por verdaderas
tantas necedades como contienen. Y aun tienen tanto atrevimiento, que se
atreven a turbar los ingenios de los discretos y bien nacidos hidalgos,
como se echa bien de ver por lo que con vuestra merced han hecho, pues le
han traído a términos que sea forzoso encerrarle en una jaula, y traerle
sobre un carro de bueyes, como quien trae o lleva algún león o algún tigre,
de lugar en lugar, para ganar con él dejando que le vean. ¡Ea, señor don
Quijote, duélase de sí mismo, y redúzgase al gremio de la discreción, y
sepa usar de la mucha que el cielo fue servido de darle, empleando el
felicísimo talento de su ingenio en otra letura que redunde en
aprovechamiento de su conciencia y en aumento de su honra! Y si todavía,
llevado de su natural inclinación, quisiere leer libros de hazañas y de
caballerías, lea en la Sacra Escritura el de los Jueces; que allí hallará
verdades grandiosas y hechos tan verdaderos como valientes. Un Viriato tuvo
Lusitania; un César, Roma; un Anibal, Cartago; un Alejandro, Grecia; un
conde Fernán González, Castilla; un Cid, Valencia; un Gonzalo Fernández,
Andalucía; un Diego García de Paredes, Estremadura; un Garci Pérez de
Vargas, Jerez; un Garcilaso, Toledo; un don Manuel de León, Sevilla, cuya
leción de sus valerosos hechos puede entretener, enseñar, deleitar y
admirar a los más altos ingenios que los leyeren. Ésta sí será letura digna
del buen entendimiento de vuestra merced, señor don Quijote mío, de la cual
saldrá erudito en la historia, enamorado de la virtud, enseñado en la
bondad, mejorado en las costumbres, valiente sin temeridad, osado sin
cobardía, y todo esto, para honra de Dios, provecho suyo y fama de la
Mancha; do, según he sabido, trae vuestra merced su principio y origen.
Atentísimamente estuvo don Quijote escuchando las razones del canónigo; y,
cuando vio que ya había puesto fin a ellas, después de haberle estado un
buen espacio mirando, le dijo:
— Paréceme, señor hidalgo, que la plática de vuestra merced se ha encaminado
a querer darme a entender que no ha habido caballeros andantes en el mundo,
y que todos los libros de caballerías son falsos, mentirosos, dañadores e
inútiles para la república; y que yo he hecho mal en leerlos, y peor en
creerlos, y más mal en imitarlos, habiéndome puesto a seguir la durísima
profesión de la caballería andante, que ellos enseñan, negándome que no ha
habido en el mundo Amadises, ni de Gaula ni de Grecia, ni todos los otros
caballeros de que las escrituras están llenas.
— Todo es al pie de la letra como vuestra merced lo va relatando —dijo a
está sazón el canónigo.
A lo cual respondió don Quijote:
— Añadió también vuestra merced, diciendo que me habían hecho mucho daño
tales libros, pues me habían vuelto el juicio y puéstome en una jaula, y
que me sería mejor hacer la enmienda y mudar de letura, leyendo otros más
verdaderos y que mejor deleitan y enseñan.
— Así es —dijo el canónigo.
— Pues yo —replicó don Quijote— hallo por mi cuenta que el sin juicio y el
encantado es vuestra merced, pues se ha puesto a decir tantas blasfemias
contra una cosa tan recebida en el mundo, y tenida por tan verdadera, que
el que la negase, como vuestra merced la niega, merecía la mesma pena que
vuestra merced dice que da a los libros cuando los lee y le enfadan. Porque
querer dar a entender a nadie que Amadís no fue en el mundo, ni todos los
otros caballeros aventureros de que están colmadas las historias, será
querer persuadir que el sol no alumbra, ni el yelo enfría, ni la tierra
sustenta; porque, ¿qué ingenio puede haber en el mundo que pueda persuadir
a otro que no fue verdad lo de la infanta Floripes y Guy de Borgoña, y lo
de Fierabrás con la puente de Mantible, que sucedió en el tiempo de
Carlomagno; que voto a tal que es tanta verdad como es ahora de día? Y si
es mentira, también lo debe de ser que no hubo Héctor, ni Aquiles, ni la
guerra de Troya, ni los Doce Pares de Francia, ni el rey Artús de
Ingalaterra, que anda hasta ahora convertido en cuervo y le esperan en su
reino por momentos. Y también se atreverán a decir que es mentirosa la
historia de Guarino Mezquino, y la de la demanda del Santo Grial, y que son
apócrifos los amores de don Tristán y la reina Iseo, como los de Ginebra y
Lanzarote, habiendo personas que casi se acuerdan de haber visto a la dueña
Quintañona, que fue la mejor escanciadora de vino que tuvo la Gran Bretaña.
Y es esto tan ansí, que me acuerdo yo que me decía una mi agüela de partes
de mi padre, cuando veía alguna dueña con tocas reverendas: ''Aquélla,
nieto, se parece a la dueña Quintañona''; de donde arguyo yo que la debió
de conocer ella o, por lo menos, debió de alcanzar a ver algún retrato
suyo. Pues, ¿quién podrá negar no ser verdadera la historia de Pierres y la
linda Magalona, pues aun hasta hoy día se vee en la armería de los reyes la
clavija con que volvía al caballo de madera, sobre quien iba el valiente
Pierres por los aires, que es un poco mayor que un timón de carreta? Y
junto a la clavija está la silla de Babieca, y en Roncesvalles está el
cuerno de Roldán, tamaño como una grande viga: de donde se infiere que hubo
Doce Pares, que hubo Pierres, que hubo Cides, y otros caballeros
semejantes,
déstos que dicen las gentes
que a sus aventuras van.
Si no, díganme también que no es verdad que fue caballero andante el
valiente lusitano Juan de Merlo, que fue a Borgoña y se combatió en la
ciudad de Ras con el famoso señor de Charní, llamado mosén Pierres, y
después, en la ciudad de Basilea, con mosén Enrique de Remestán, saliendo
de entrambas empresas vencedor y lleno de honrosa fama; y las aventuras y
desafíos que también acabaron en Borgoña los valientes españoles Pedro
Barba y Gutierre Quijada (de cuya alcurnia yo deciendo por línea recta de
varón), venciendo a los hijos del conde de San Polo. Niéguenme, asimesmo,
que no fue a buscar las aventuras a Alemania don Fernando de Guevara, donde
se combatió con micer Jorge, caballero de la casa del duque de Austria;
digan que fueron burla las justas de Suero de Quiñones, del Paso; las
empresas de mosén Luis de Falces contra don Gonzalo de Guzmán, caballero
castellano, con otras muchas hazañas hechas por caballeros cristianos,
déstos y de los reinos estranjeros, tan auténticas y verdaderas, que torno
a decir que el que las negase carecería de toda razón y buen discurso.
Admirado quedó el canónigo de oír la mezcla que don Quijote hacía de
verdades y mentiras, y de ver la noticia que tenía de todas aquellas cosas
tocantes y concernientes a los hechos de su andante caballería; y así, le
respondió:
— No puedo yo negar, señor don Quijote, que no sea verdad algo de lo que
vuestra merced ha dicho, especialmente en lo que toca a los caballeros
andantes españoles; y, asimesmo, quiero conceder que hubo Doce Pares de
Francia, pero no quiero creer que hicieron todas aquellas cosas que el
arzobispo Turpín dellos escribe; porque la verdad dello es que fueron
caballeros escogidos por los reyes de Francia, a quien llamaron pares por
ser todos iguales en valor, en calidad y en valentía; a lo menos, si no lo
eran, era razón que lo fuesen y era como una religión de las que ahora se
usan de Santiago o de Calatrava, que se presupone que los que la profesan
han de ser, o deben ser, caballeros valerosos, valientes y bien nacidos; y,
como ahora dicen caballero de San Juan, o de Alcántara, decían en aquel
tiempo caballero de los Doce Pares, porque no fueron doce iguales los que
para esta religión militar se escogieron. En lo de que hubo Cid no hay
duda, ni menos Bernardo del Carpio, pero de que hicieron las hazañas que
dicen, creo que la hay muy grande. En lo otro de la clavija que vuestra
merced dice del conde Pierres, y que está junto a la silla de Babieca en la
armería de los reyes, confieso mi pecado; que soy tan ignorante, o tan
corto de vista, que, aunque he visto la silla, no he echado de ver la
clavija, y más siendo tan grande como vuestra merced ha dicho.
— Pues allí está, sin duda alguna —replicó don Quijote—; y, por más señas,
dicen que está metida en una funda de vaqueta, porque no se tome de moho.
— Todo puede ser —respondió el canónigo—; pero, por las órdenes que recebí,
que no me acuerdo haberla visto. Mas, puesto que conceda que está allí, no
por eso me obligo a creer las historias de tantos Amadises, ni las de tanta
turbamulta de caballeros como por ahí nos cuentan; ni es razón que un
hombre como vuestra merced, tan honrado y de tan buenas partes, y dotado de
tan buen entendimiento, se dé a entender que son verdaderas tantas y tan
estrañas locuras como las que están escritas en los disparatados libros de
caballerías.
Capítulo L. De las discretas altercaciones que don Quijote y el canónigo
tuvieron, con otros sucesos
— ¡Bueno está eso! —respondió don Quijote—. Los libros que están impresos
con licencia de los reyes y con aprobación de aquellos a quien se
remitieron, y que con gusto general son leídos y celebrados de los grandes
y de los chicos, de los pobres y de los ricos, de los letrados e
ignorantes, de los plebeyos y caballeros, finalmente, de todo género de
personas, de cualquier estado y condición que sean, ¿habían de ser
mentira?; y más llevando tanta apariencia de verdad, pues nos cuentan el
padre, la madre, la patria, los parientes, la edad, el lugar y las hazañas,
punto por punto y día por día, que el tal caballero hizo, o caballeros
hicieron. Calle vuestra merced, no diga tal blasfemia (y créame que le
aconsejo en esto lo que debe de hacer como discreto), sino léalos, y verá
el gusto que recibe de su leyenda. Si no, dígame: ¿hay mayor contento que
ver, como si dijésemos: aquí ahora se muestra delante de nosotros un gran
lago de pez hirviendo a borbollones, y que andan nadando y cruzando por él
muchas serpientes, culebras y lagartos, y otros muchos géneros de animales
feroces y espantables, y que del medio del lago sale una voz tristísima que
dice: ''Tú, caballero, quienquiera que seas, que el temeroso lago estás
mirando, si quieres alcanzar el bien que debajo destas negras aguas se
encubre, muestra el valor de tu fuerte pecho y arrójate en mitad de su
negro y encendido licor; porque si así no lo haces, no serás digno de ver
las altas maravillas que en sí encierran y contienen los siete castillos de
las siete fadas que debajo desta negregura yacen?'' ¿Y que, apenas el
caballero no ha acabado de oír la voz temerosa, cuando, sin entrar más en
cuentas consigo, sin ponerse a considerar el peligro a que se pone, y aun
sin despojarse de la pesadumbre de sus fuertes armas, encomendándose a Dios
y a su señora, se arroja en mitad del bullente lago, y, cuando no se cata
ni sabe dónde ha de parar, se halla entre unos floridos campos, con quien
los Elíseos no tienen que ver en ninguna cosa? Allí le parece que el cielo
es más transparente, y que el sol luce con claridad más nueva; ofrécesele a
los ojos una apacible floresta de tan verdes y frondosos árboles compuesta,
que alegra a la vista su verdura, y entretiene los oídos el dulce y no
aprendido canto de los pequeños, infinitos y pintados pajarillos que por
los intricados ramos van cruzando. Aquí descubre un arroyuelo, cuyas
frescas aguas, que líquidos cristales parecen, corren sobre menudas arenas
y blancas pedrezuelas, que oro cernido y puras perlas semejan; acullá vee
una artificiosa fuente de jaspe variado y de liso mármol compuesta; acá vee
otra a lo brutesco adornada, adonde las menudas conchas de las almejas, con
las torcidas casas blancas y amarillas del caracol, puestas con orden
desordenada, mezclados entre ellas pedazos de cristal luciente y de
contrahechas esmeraldas, hacen una variada labor, de manera que el arte,
imitando a la naturaleza, parece que allí la vence. Acullá de improviso se
le descubre un fuerte castillo o vistoso alcázar, cuyas murallas son de
macizo oro, las almenas de diamantes, las puertas de jacintos; finalmente,
él es de tan admirable compostura que, con ser la materia de que está
formado no menos que de diamantes, de carbuncos, de rubíes, de perlas, de
oro y de esmeraldas, es de más estimación su hechura. Y ¿hay más que ver,
después de haber visto esto, que ver salir por la puerta del castillo un
buen número de doncellas, cuyos galanos y vistosos trajes, si yo me pusiese
ahora a decirlos como las historias nos los cuentan, sería nunca acabar; y
tomar luego la que parecía principal de todas por la mano al atrevido
caballero que se arrojó en el ferviente lago, y llevarle, sin hablarle
palabra, dentro del rico alcázar o castillo, y hacerle desnudar como su
madre le parió, y bañarle con templadas aguas, y luego untarle todo con
olorosos ungüentos, y vestirle una camisa de cendal delgadísimo, toda
olorosa y perfumada, y acudir otra doncella y echarle un mantón sobre los
hombros, que, por lo menos menos, dicen que suele valer una ciudad, y aun
más? ¿Qué es ver, pues, cuando nos cuentan que, tras todo esto, le llevan a
otra sala, donde halla puestas las mesas, con tanto concierto, que queda
suspenso y admirado?; ¿qué, el verle echar agua a manos, toda de ámbar y de
olorosas flores distilada?; ¿qué, el hacerle sentar sobre una silla de
marfil?; ¿qué, verle servir todas las doncellas, guardando un maravilloso
silencio?; ¿qué, el traerle tanta diferencia de manjares, tan sabrosamente
guisados, que no sabe el apetito a cuál deba de alargar la mano? ¿Cuál será
oír la música que en tanto que come suena, sin saberse quién la canta ni
adónde suena? ¿Y, después de la comida acabada y las mesas alzadas,
quedarse el caballero recostado sobre la silla, y quizá mondándose los
dientes, como es costumbre, entrar a deshora por la puerta de la sala otra
mucho más hermosa doncella que ninguna de las primeras, y sentarse al lado
del caballero, y comenzar a darle cuenta de qué castillo es aquél, y de
cómo ella está encantada en él, con otras cosas que suspenden al caballero
y admiran a los leyentes que van leyendo su historia? No quiero alargarme
más en esto, pues dello se puede colegir que cualquiera parte que se lea,
de cualquiera historia de caballero andante, ha de causar gusto y maravilla
a cualquiera que la leyere. Y vuestra merced créame, y, como otra vez le he
dicho, lea estos libros, y verá cómo le destierran la melancolía que
tuviere, y le mejoran la condición, si acaso la tiene mala. De mí sé decir
que, después que soy caballero andante, soy valiente, comedido, liberal,
bien criado, generoso, cortés, atrevido, blando, paciente, sufridor de
trabajos, de prisiones, de encantos; y, aunque ha tan poco que me vi
encerrado en una jaula, como loco, pienso, por el valor de mi brazo,
favoreciéndome el cielo y no me siendo contraria la fortuna, en pocos días
verme rey de algún reino, adonde pueda mostrar el agradecimiento y
liberalidad que mi pecho encierra. Que, mía fe, señor, el pobre está
inhabilitado de poder mostrar la virtud de liberalidad con ninguno, aunque
en sumo grado la posea; y el agradecimiento que sólo consiste en el deseo
es cosa muerta, como es muerta la fe sin obras. Por esto querría que la
fortuna me ofreciese presto alguna ocasión donde me hiciese emperador, por
mostrar mi pecho haciendo bien a mis amigos, especialmente a este pobre de
Sancho Panza, mi escudero, que es el mejor hombre del mundo, y querría
darle un condado que le tengo muchos días ha prometido, sino que temo que
no ha de tener habilidad para gobernar su estado.
Casi estas últimas palabras oyó Sancho a su amo, a quien dijo:
— Trabaje vuestra merced, señor don Quijote, en darme ese condado, tan
prometido de vuestra merced como de mí esperado, que yo le prometo que no
me falte a mí habilidad para gobernarle; y, cuando me faltare, yo he oído
decir que hay hombres en el mundo que toman en arrendamiento los estados de
los señores, y les dan un tanto cada año, y ellos se tienen cuidado del
gobierno, y el señor se está a pierna tendida, gozando de la renta que le
dan, sin curarse de otra cosa;
y así haré yo, y no repararé en tanto más cuanto, sino que luego me
desistiré de todo, y me gozaré mi renta como un duque, y allá se lo hayan.
— Eso, hermano Sancho —dijo el canónigo—, entiéndese en cuanto al gozar la
renta; empero, al administrar justicia, ha de atender el señor del estado,
y aquí entra la habilidad y buen juicio, y principalmente la buena
intención de acertar; que si ésta falta en los principios, siempre irán
errados los medios y los fines; y así suele Dios ayudar al buen deseo del
simple como desfavorecer al malo del discreto.
— No sé esas filosofías —respondió Sancho Panza—; mas sólo sé que tan presto
tuviese yo el condado como sabría regirle; que tanta alma tengo yo como
otro, y tanto cuerpo como el que más, y tan rey sería yo de mi estado como
cada uno del suyo; y, siéndolo, haría lo que quisiese; y, haciendo lo que
quisiese, haría mi gusto; y, haciendo mi gusto, estaría contento; y, en
estando uno contento, no tiene más que desear; y, no teniendo más que
desear, acabóse; y el estado venga, y a Dios y veámonos, como dijo un ciego
a otro.
— No son malas filosofías ésas, como tú dices, Sancho; pero, con todo eso,
hay mucho que decir sobre esta materia de condados.
A lo cual replicó don Quijote:
— Yo no sé que haya más que decir; sólo me guío por el ejemplo que me da el
grande Amadís de Gaula, que hizo a su escudero conde de la Ínsula Firme; y
así, puedo yo, sin escrúpulo de conciencia, hacer conde a Sancho Panza, que
es uno de los mejores escuderos que caballero andante ha tenido.
Admirado quedó el canónigo de los concertados disparates que don Quijote
había dicho, del modo con que había pintado la aventura del Caballero del
Lago, de la impresión que en él habían hecho las pensadas mentiras de los
libros que había leído; y, finalmente, le admiraba la necedad de Sancho,
que con tanto ahínco deseaba alcanzar el condado que su amo le había
prometido.
Ya en esto, volvían los criados del canónigo, que a la venta habían ido por
la acémila del repuesto, y, haciendo mesa de una alhombra y de la verde
yerba del prado, a la sombra de unos árboles se sentaron, y comieron allí,
porque el boyero no perdiese la comodidad de aquel sitio, como queda dicho.
Y, estando comiendo, a deshora oyeron un recio estruendo y un son de
esquila, que por entre unas zarzas y espesas matas que allí junto estaban
sonaba, y al mesmo instante vieron salir de entre aquellas malezas una
hermosa cabra, toda la piel manchada de negro, blanco y pardo. Tras ella
venía un cabrero dándole voces, y diciéndole palabras a su uso, para que se
detuviese, o al rebaño volviese. La fugitiva cabra, temerosa y despavorida,
se vino a la gente, como a favorecerse della, y allí se detuvo. Llegó el
cabrero, y, asiéndola de los cuernos, como si fuera capaz de discurso y
entendimiento, le dijo:
— ¡Ah cerrera, cerrera, Manchada, Manchada, y cómo andáis vos estos días de
pie cojo! ¿Qué lobos os espantan, hija? ¿No me diréis qué es esto, hermosa?
Mas ¡qué puede ser sino que sois hembra, y no podéis estar sosegada; que
mal haya vuestra condición, y la de todas aquellas a quien imitáis! Volved,
volved, amiga; que si no tan contenta, a lo menos, estaréis más segura en
vuestro aprisco, o con vuestras compañeras; que si vos que las habéis de
guardar y encaminar andáis tan sin guía y tan descaminada, ¿en qué podrán
parar ellas?
Contento dieron las palabras del cabrero a los que las oyeron,
especialmente al canónigo, que le dijo:
— Por vida vuestra, hermano, que os soseguéis un poco y no os acuciéis en
volver tan presto esa cabra a su rebaño; que, pues ella es hembra, como vos
decís, ha de seguir su natural distinto, por más que vos os pongáis a
estorbarlo. Tomad este bocado y bebed una vez, con que templaréis la
cólera, y en tanto, descansará la cabra.
Y el decir esto y el darle con la punta del cuchillo los lomos de un conejo
fiambre, todo fue uno. Tomólo y agradeciólo el cabrero; bebió y sosegóse, y
luego dijo:
— No querría que por haber yo hablado con esta alimaña tan en seso, me
tuviesen vuestras mercedes por hombre simple; que en verdad que no carecen
de misterio las palabras que le dije. Rústico soy, pero no tanto que no
entienda cómo se ha de tratar con los hombres y con las bestias.
— Eso creo yo muy bien —dijo el cura—, que ya yo sé de esperiencia que los
montes crían letrados y las cabañas de los pastores encierran filósofos.
— A lo menos, señor —replicó el cabrero—, acogen hombres escarmentados; y
para que creáis esta verdad y la toquéis con la mano, aunque parezca que
sin ser rogado me convido, si no os enfadáis dello y queréis, señores, un
breve espacio prestarme oído atento, os contaré una verdad que acredite lo
que ese señor (señalando al cura) ha dicho, y la mía.
A esto respondió don Quijote:
— Por ver que tiene este caso un no sé qué de sombra de aventura de
caballería, yo, por mi parte, os oiré, hermano, de muy buena gana, y así lo
harán todos estos señores, por lo mucho que tienen de discretos y de ser
amigos de curiosas novedades que suspendan, alegren y entretengan los
sentidos, como, sin duda, pienso que lo ha de hacer vuestro cuento.
Comenzad, pues, amigo, que todos escucharemos.
— Saco la mía —dijo Sancho—; que yo a aquel arroyo me voy con esta empanada,
donde pienso hartarme por tres días; porque he oído decir a mi señor don
Quijote que el escudero de caballero andante ha de comer, cuando se le
ofreciere, hasta no poder más, a causa que se les suele ofrecer entrar
acaso por una selva tan intricada que no aciertan a salir della en seis
días; y si el hombre no va harto, o bien proveídas las alforjas, allí se
podrá quedar, como muchas veces se queda, hecho carne momia.
— Tú estás en lo cierto, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—: vete adonde quisieres, y
come lo que pudieres; que yo ya estoy satisfecho, y sólo me falta dar al
alma su refacción, como se la daré escuchando el cuento deste buen hombre.
— Así las daremos todos a las nuestras —dijo el canónigo.
Y luego, rogó al cabrero que diese principio a lo que prometido había. El
cabrero dio dos palmadas sobre el lomo a la cabra, que por los cuernos
tenía, diciéndole:
— Recuéstate junto a mí, Manchada, que tiempo nos queda para volver a
nuestro apero.
Parece que lo entendió la cabra, porque, en sentándose su dueño, se tendió
ella junto a él con mucho sosiego, y, mirándole al rostro, daba a entender
que estaba atenta a lo que el cabrero iba diciendo, el cual comenzó su
historia desta manera:
Capítulo LI. Que trata de lo que contó el cabrero a todos los que llevaban
a don Quijote
— «Tres leguas deste valle está una aldea que, aunque pequeña, es de las más
ricas que hay en todos estos contornos; en la cual había un labrador muy
honrado, y tanto, que, aunque es anexo al ser rico el ser honrado, más lo
era él por la virtud que tenía que por la riqueza que alcanzaba. Mas lo que
le hacía más dichoso, según él decía, era tener una hija de tan estremada
hermosura, rara discreción, donaire y virtud, que el que la conocía y la
miraba se admiraba de ver las estremadas partes con que el cielo y la
naturaleza la habían enriquecido. Siendo niña fue hermosa, y siempre fue
creciendo en belleza, y en la edad de diez y seis años fue hermosísima. La
fama de su belleza se comenzó a estender por todas las circunvecinas
aldeas, ¿qué digo yo por las circunvecinas no más, si se estendió a las
apartadas ciudades, y aun se entró por las salas de los reyes, y por los
oídos de todo género de gente; que, como a cosa rara, o como a imagen de
milagros, de todas partes a verla venían? Guardábala su padre, y guardábase
ella; que no hay candados, guardas ni cerraduras que mejor guarden a una
doncella que las del recato proprio.
»La riqueza del padre y la belleza de la hija movieron a muchos, así del
pueblo como forasteros, a que por mujer se la pidiesen; mas él, como a
quien tocaba disponer de tan rica joya, andaba confuso, sin saber
determinarse a quién la entregaría de los infinitos que le importunaban. Y,
entre los muchos que tan buen deseo tenían, fui yo uno, a quien dieron
muchas y grandes esperanzas de buen suceso conocer que el padre conocía
quien yo era, el ser natural del mismo pueblo, limpio en sangre, en la edad
floreciente, en la hacienda muy rico y en el ingenio no menos acabado. Con
todas estas mismas partes la pidió también otro del mismo pueblo, que fue
causa de suspender y poner en balanza la voluntad del padre, a quien
parecía que con cualquiera de nosotros estaba su hija bien empleada; y, por
salir desta confusión, determinó decírselo a Leandra, que así se llama la
rica que en miseria me tiene puesto, advirtiendo que, pues los dos éramos
iguales, era bien dejar a la voluntad de su querida hija el escoger a su
gusto: cosa digna de imitar de todos los padres que a sus hijos quieren
poner en estado: no digo yo que los dejen escoger en cosas ruines y malas,
sino que se las propongan buenas, y de las buenas, que escojan a su gusto.
No sé yo el que tuvo Leandra; sólo sé que el padre nos entretuvo a
entrambos con la poca edad de su hija y con palabras generales, que ni le
obligaban, ni nos desobligaba tampoco. Llámase mi competidor Anselmo, y yo
Eugenio, porque vais con noticia de los nombres de las personas que en esta
tragedia se contienen, cuyo fin aún está pendiente; pero bien se deja
entender que será desastrado.
»En esta sazón, vino a nuestro pueblo un Vicente de la Rosa, hijo de un
pobre labrador del mismo lugar; el cual Vicente venía de las Italias, y de
otras diversas partes, de ser soldado. Llevóle de nuestro lugar, siendo
muchacho de hasta doce años, un capitán que con su compañía por allí acertó
a pasar, y volvió el mozo de allí a otros doce, vestido a la soldadesca,
pintado con mil colores, lleno de mil dijes de cristal y sutiles cadenas de
acero. Hoy se ponía una gala y mañana otra; pero todas sutiles, pintadas,
de poco peso y menos tomo. La gente labradora, que de suyo es maliciosa, y
dándole el ocio lugar es la misma malicia, lo notó, y contó punto por punto
sus galas y preseas, y halló que los vestidos eran tres, de diferentes
colores, con sus ligas y medias; pero él hacía tantos guisados e
invenciones dellas, que si no se los contaran, hubiera quien jurara que
había hecho muestra de más de diez pares de vestidos y de más de veinte
plumajes. Y no parezca impertinencia y demasía esto que de los vestidos voy
contando, porque ellos hacen una buena parte en esta historia.
»Sentábase en un poyo que debajo de un gran álamo está en nuestra plaza, y
allí nos tenía a todos la boca abierta, pendientes de las hazañas que nos
iba contando. No había tierra en todo el orbe que no hubiese visto, ni
batalla donde no se hubiese hallado; había muerto más moros que tiene
Marruecos y Túnez, y entrado en más singulares desafíos, según él decía,
que Gante y Luna, Diego García de Paredes y otros mil que nombraba; y de
todos había salido con vitoria, sin que le hubiesen derramado una sola gota
de sangre. Por otra parte, mostraba señales de heridas que, aunque no se
divisaban, nos hacía entender que eran arcabuzazos dados en diferentes
rencuentros y faciones. Finalmente, con una no vista arrogancia, llamaba de
vos a sus iguales y a los mismos que le conocían, y decía que su padre era
su brazo, su linaje, sus obras, y que debajo de ser soldado, al mismo rey
no debía nada. Añadiósele a estas arrogancias ser un poco músico y tocar
una guitarra a lo rasgado, de manera que decían algunos que la hacía
hablar; pero no pararon aquí sus gracias, que también la tenía de poeta, y
así, de cada niñería que pasaba en el pueblo, componía un romance de legua
y media de escritura.
»Este soldado, pues, que aquí he pintado, este Vicente de la Rosa, este
bravo, este galán, este músico, este poeta fue visto y mirado muchas veces
de Leandra, desde una ventana de su casa que tenía la vista a la plaza.
Enamoróla el oropel de sus vistosos trajes, encantáronla sus romances, que
de cada uno que componía daba veinte traslados, llegaron a sus oídos las
hazañas que él de sí mismo había referido, y, finalmente, que así el diablo
lo debía de tener ordenado, ella se vino a enamorar dél, antes que en él
naciese presunción de solicitalla. Y, como en los casos de amor no hay
ninguno que con más facilidad se cumpla que aquel que tiene de su parte el
deseo de la dama, con facilidad se concertaron Leandra y Vicente; y,
primero que alguno de sus muchos pretendientes cayesen en la cuenta de su
deseo, ya ella le tenía cumplido, habiendo dejado la casa de su querido y
amado padre, que madre no la tiene, y ausentádose de la aldea con el
soldado, que salió con más triunfo desta empresa que de todas las muchas
que él se aplicaba.
»Admiró el suceso a toda el aldea, y aun a todos los que dél noticia
tuvieron; yo quedé suspenso, Anselmo, atónito, el padre triste, sus
parientes afrentados, solícita la justicia, los cuadrilleros listos;
tomáronse los caminos, escudriñáronse los bosques y cuanto había, y, al
cabo de tres días, hallaron a la antojadiza Leandra en una cueva de un
monte, desnuda en camisa, sin muchos dineros y preciosísimas joyas que de
su casa había sacado. Volviéronla a la presencia del lastimado padre;
preguntáronle su desgracia; confesó sin apremio que Vicente de la Roca la
había engañado, y debajo de su palabra de ser su esposo la persuadió que
dejase la casa de su padre; que él la llevaría a la más rica y más viciosa
ciudad que había en todo el universo mundo, que era Nápoles; y que ella,
mal advertida y peor engañada, le había creído; y, robando a su padre, se
le entregó la misma noche que había faltado; y que él la llevó a un áspero
monte, y la encerró en aquella cueva donde la habían hallado. Contó también
como el soldado, sin quitalle su honor, le robó cuanto tenía, y la dejó en
aquella cueva y se fue: suceso que de nuevo puso en admiración a todos.
»Duro se nos hizo de creer la continencia del mozo, pero ella lo afirmó con
tantas veras, que fueron parte para que el desconsolado padre se consolase,
no haciendo cuenta de las riquezas que le llevaban, pues le habían dejado a
su hija con la joya que, si una vez se pierde, no deja esperanza de que
jamás se cobre. El mismo día que pareció Leandra la despareció su padre de
nuestros ojos, y la llevó a encerrar en un monesterio de una villa que está
aquí cerca, esperando que el tiempo gaste alguna parte de la mala opinión
en que su hija se puso. Los pocos años de Leandra sirvieron de disculpa de
su culpa, a lo menos con aquellos que no les iba algún interés en que ella
fuese mala o buena; pero los que conocían su discreción y mucho
entendimiento no atribuyeron a ignorancia su pecado, sino a su desenvoltura
y a la natural inclinación de las mujeres, que, por la mayor parte, suele
ser desatinada y mal compuesta.
»Encerrada Leandra, quedaron los ojos de Anselmo ciegos, a lo menos sin
tener cosa que mirar que contento le diese; los míos en tinieblas, sin luz
que a ninguna cosa de gusto les encaminase; con la ausencia de Leandra,
crecía nuestra tristeza, apocábase nuestra paciencia, maldecíamos las galas
del soldado y abominábamos del poco recato del padre de Leandra.
Finalmente, Anselmo y yo nos concertamos de dejar el aldea y venirnos a
este valle, donde él, apacentando una gran cantidad de ovejas suyas
proprias, y yo un numeroso rebaño de cabras, también mías, pasamos la vida
entre los árboles, dando vado a nuestras pasiones, o cantando juntos
alabanzas o vituperios de la hermosa Leandra, o suspirando solos y a solas
comunicando con el cielo nuestras querellas.
»A imitación nuestra, otros muchos de los pretendientes de Leandra se han
venido a estos ásperos montes, usando el mismo ejercicio nuestro; y son
tantos, que parece que este sitio se ha convertido en la pastoral Arcadia,
según está colmo de pastores y de apriscos, y no hay parte en él donde no
se oiga el nombre de la hermosa Leandra. Éste la maldice y la llama
antojadiza, varia y deshonesta; aquél la condena por fácil y ligera; tal la
absuelve y perdona, y tal la justicia y vitupera; uno celebra su hermosura,
otro reniega de su condición, y, en fin, todos la deshonran, y todos la
adoran, y de todos se estiende a tanto la locura, que hay quien se queje de
desdén sin haberla jamás hablado, y aun quien se lamente y sienta la
rabiosa enfermedad de los celos, que ella jamás dio a nadie; porque, como
ya tengo dicho, antes se supo su pecado que su deseo. No hay hueco de peña,
ni margen de arroyo, ni sombra de árbol que no esté ocupada de algún pastor
que sus desventuras a los aires cuente; el eco repite el nombre de Leandra
dondequiera que pueda formarse: Leandra resuenan los montes, Leandra
murmuran los arroyos, y Leandra nos tiene a todos suspensos y encantados,
esperando sin esperanza y temiendo sin saber de qué tememos. Entre estos
disparatados, el que muestra que menos y más juicio tiene es mi competidor
Anselmo, el cual, teniendo tantas otras cosas de que quejarse, sólo se
queja de ausencia; y al son de un rabel, que admirablemente toca, con
versos donde muestra su buen entendimiento, cantando se queja. Yo sigo otro
camino más fácil, y a mi parecer el más acertado, que es decir mal de la
ligereza de las mujeres, de su inconstancia, de su doble trato, de sus
promesas muertas, de su fe rompida, y, finalmente, del poco discurso que
tienen en saber colocar sus pensamientos e intenciones que tienen.» Y ésta
fue la ocasión, señores, de las palabras y razones que dije a esta cabra
cuando aquí llegué; que por ser hembra la tengo en poco, aunque es la mejor
de todo mi apero. Ésta es la historia que prometí contaros; si he sido en
el contarla prolijo, no seré en serviros corto: cerca de aquí tengo mi
majada, y en ella tengo fresca leche y muy sabrosísimo queso, con otras
varias y sazonadas frutas, no menos a la vista que al gusto agradables.
Capítulo LII. De la pendencia que don Quijote tuvo con el cabrero, con la
rara aventura de los deceplinantes, a quien dio felice fin a costa de su
sudor
General gusto causó el cuento del cabrero a todos los que escuchado le
habían; especialmente le recibió el canónigo, que con estraña curiosidad
notó la manera con que le había contado, tan lejos de parecer rústico
cabrero cuan cerca de mostrarse discreto cortesano; y así, dijo que había
dicho muy bien el cura en decir que los montes criaban letrados. Todos se
ofrecieron a Eugenio; pero el que más se mostró liberal en esto fue don
Quijote, que le dijo:
— Por cierto, hermano cabrero, que si yo me hallara posibilitado de poder
comenzar alguna aventura, que luego luego me pusiera en camino porque vos
la tuviérades buena; que yo sacara del monesterio, donde, sin duda alguna,
debe de estar contra su voluntad, a Leandra, a pesar de la abadesa y de
cuantos quisieran estorbarlo, y os la pusiera en vuestras manos, para que
hiciérades della a toda vuestra voluntad y talante, guardando, pero, las
leyes de la caballería, que mandan que a ninguna doncella se le sea fecho
desaguisado alguno; aunque yo espero en Dios Nuestro Señor que no ha de
poder tanto la fuerza de un encantador malicioso, que no pueda más la de
otro encantador mejor intencionado, y para entonces os prometo mi favor y
ayuda, como me obliga mi profesión, que no es otra si no es favorecer a los
desvalidos y menesterosos.
Miróle el cabrero, y, como vio a don Quijote de tan mal pelaje y catadura,
admiróse y preguntó al barbero, que cerca de sí tenía:
— Señor, ¿quién es este hombre, que tal talle tiene y de tal manera habla?
— ¿Quién ha de ser —respondió el barbero— sino el famoso don Quijote de la
Mancha, desfacedor de agravios, enderezador de tuertos, el amparo de las
doncellas, el asombro de los gigantes y el vencedor de las batallas?
— Eso me semeja —respondió el cabrero— a lo que se lee en los libros de
caballeros andantes, que hacían todo eso que de este hombre vuestra merced
dice; puesto que para mí tengo, o que vuestra merced se burla, o que este
gentil hombre debe de tener vacíos los aposentos de la cabeza.
— Sois un grandísimo bellaco —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—; y vos sois el
vacío y el menguado, que yo estoy más lleno que jamás lo estuvo la muy
hideputa puta que os parió.
Y, diciendo y haciendo, arrebató de un pan que junto a sí tenía, y dio con
él al cabrero en todo el rostro, con tanta furia, que le remachó las
narices; mas el cabrero, que no sabía de burlas, viendo con cuántas veras
le maltrataban, sin tener respeto a la alhombra, ni a los manteles, ni a
todos aquellos que comiendo estaban, saltó sobre don Quijote, y, asiéndole
del cuello con entrambas manos, no dudara de ahogalle, si Sancho Panza no
llegara en aquel punto, y le asiera por las espaldas y diera con él encima
de la mesa, quebrando platos, rompiendo tazas y derramando y esparciendo
cuanto en ella estaba. Don Quijote, que se vio libre, acudió a subirse
sobre el cabrero; el cual, lleno de sangre el rostro, molido a coces de
Sancho, andaba buscando a gatas algún cuchillo de la mesa para hacer alguna
sanguinolenta venganza, pero estorbábanselo el canónigo y el cura; mas el
barbero hizo de suerte que el cabrero cogió debajo de sí a don Quijote,
sobre el cual llovió tanto número de mojicones, que del rostro del pobre
caballero llovía tanta sangre como del suyo.
Reventaban de risa el canónigo y el cura, saltaban los cuadrilleros de
gozo, zuzaban los unos y los otros, como hacen a los perros cuando en
pendencia están trabados; sólo Sancho Panza se desesperaba, porque no se
podía desasir de un criado del canónigo, que le estorbaba que a su amo no
ayudase.
En resolución, estando todos en regocijo y fiesta, sino los dos aporreantes
que se carpían, oyeron el son de una trompeta, tan triste que les hizo
volver los rostros hacia donde les pareció que sonaba; pero el que más se
alborotó de oírle fue don Quijote, el cual, aunque estaba debajo del
cabrero, harto contra su voluntad y más que medianamente molido, le dijo:
— Hermano demonio, que no es posible que dejes de serlo, pues has tenido
valor y fuerzas para sujetar las mías, ruégote que hagamos treguas, no más
de por una hora; porque el doloroso son de aquella trompeta que a nuestros
oídos llega me parece que a alguna nueva aventura me llama.
El cabrero, que ya estaba cansado de moler y ser molido, le dejó luego, y
don Quijote se puso en pie, volviendo asimismo el rostro adonde el son se
oía, y vio a deshora que por un recuesto bajaban muchos hombres vestidos de
blanco, a modo de diciplinantes.
Era el caso que aquel año habían las nubes negado su rocío a la tierra, y
por todos los lugares de aquella comarca se hacían procesiones, rogativas y
diciplinas, pidiendo a Dios abriese las manos de su misericordia y les
lloviese; y para este efecto la gente de una aldea que allí junto estaba
venía en procesión a una devota ermita que en un recuesto de aquel valle
había.
Don Quijote, que vio los estraños trajes de los diciplinantes, sin pasarle
por la memoria las muchas veces que los había de haber visto, se imaginó
que era cosa de aventura, y que a él solo tocaba, como a caballero andante,
el acometerla; y confirmóle más esta imaginación pensar que una imagen que
traían cubierta de luto fuese alguna principal señora que llevaban por
fuerza aquellos follones y descomedidos malandrines; y, como esto le cayó
en las mientes, con gran ligereza arremetió a Rocinante, que paciendo
andaba, quitándole del arzón el freno y el adarga, y en un punto le
enfrenó, y, pidiendo a Sancho su espada, subió sobre Rocinante y embrazó su
adarga, y dijo en alta voz a todos los que presentes estaban:
— Agora, valerosa compañía, veredes cuánto importa que haya en el mundo
caballeros que profesen la orden de la andante caballería; agora digo que
veredes, en la libertad de aquella buena señora que allí va cautiva, si se
han de estimar los caballeros andantes.
Y, en diciendo esto, apretó los muslos a Rocinante, porque espuelas no las
tenía, y, a todo galope, porque carrera tirada no se lee en toda esta
verdadera historia que jamás la diese Rocinante, se fue a encontrar con los
diciplinantes, bien que fueran el cura y el canónigo y barbero a detenelle;
mas no les fue posible, ni menos le detuvieron las voces que Sancho le
daba, diciendo:
— ¿Adónde va, señor don Quijote? ¿Qué demonios lleva en el pecho, que le
incitan a ir contra nuestra fe católica? Advierta, mal haya yo, que aquélla
es procesión de diciplinantes, y que aquella señora que llevan sobre la
peana es la imagen benditísima de la Virgen sin mancilla; mire, señor, lo
que hace, que por esta vez se puede decir que no es lo que sabe.
Fatigóse en vano Sancho, porque su amo iba tan puesto en llegar a los
ensabanados y en librar a la señora enlutada, que no oyó palabra; y, aunque
la oyera, no volviera, si el rey se lo mandara. Llegó, pues, a la
procesión, y paró a Rocinante, que ya llevaba deseo de quietarse un poco,
y, con turbada y ronca voz, dijo:
— Vosotros, que, quizá por no ser buenos, os encubrís los rostros, atended y
escuchad lo que deciros quiero.
Los primeros que se detuvieron fueron los que la imagen llevaban; y uno de
los cuatro clérigos que cantaban las ledanías, viendo la estraña catadura
de don Quijote, la flaqueza de Rocinante y otras circunstancias de risa que
notó y descubrió en don Quijote, le respondió diciendo:
— Señor hermano, si nos quiere decir algo, dígalo presto, porque se van
estos hermanos abriendo las carnes, y no podemos, ni es razón que nos
detengamos a oír cosa alguna, si ya no es tan breve que en dos palabras se
diga.
— En una lo diré —replicó don Quijote—, y es ésta: que luego al punto dejéis
libre a esa hermosa señora, cuyas lágrimas y triste semblante dan claras
muestras que la lleváis contra su voluntad y que algún notorio desaguisado
le habedes fecho; y yo, que nací en el mundo para desfacer semejantes
agravios, no consentiré que un solo paso adelante pase sin darle la deseada
libertad que merece.
En estas razones, cayeron todos los que las oyeron que don Quijote debía de
ser algún hombre loco, y tomáronse a reír muy de gana; cuya risa fue poner
pólvora a la cólera de don Quijote, porque, sin decir más palabra, sacando
la espada, arremetió a las andas. Uno de aquellos que las llevaban, dejando
la carga a sus compañeros, salió al encuentro de don Quijote, enarbolando
una horquilla o bastón con que sustentaba las andas en tanto que
descansaba; y, recibiendo en ella una gran cuchillada que le tiró don
Quijote, con que se la hizo dos partes, con el último tercio, que le quedó
en la mano, dio tal golpe a don Quijote encima de un hombro, por el mismo
lado de la espada, que no pudo cubrir el adarga contra villana fuerza, que
el pobre don Quijote vino al suelo muy mal parado.
Sancho Panza, que jadeando le iba a los alcances, viéndole caído, dio voces
a su moledor que no le diese otro palo, porque era un pobre caballero
encantado, que no había hecho mal a nadie en todos los días de su vida.
Mas, lo que detuvo al villano no fueron las voces de Sancho, sino el ver
que don Quijote no bullía pie ni mano; y así, creyendo que le había muerto,
con priesa se alzó la túnica a la cinta, y dio a huir por la campaña como
un gamo.
Ya en esto llegaron todos los de la compañía de don Quijote adonde él
estaba; y más los de la procesión, que los vieron venir corriendo, y con
ellos los cuadrilleros con sus ballestas, temieron algún mal suceso, y
hiciéronse todos un remolino alrededor de la imagen; y, alzados los
capirotes, empuñando las diciplinas, y los clérigos los ciriales, esperaban
el asalto con determinación de defenderse, y aun ofender, si pudiesen, a
sus acometedores; pero la fortuna lo hizo mejor que se pensaba, porque
Sancho no hizo otra cosa que arrojarse sobre el cuerpo de su señor,
haciendo sobre él el más doloroso y risueño llanto del mundo, creyendo que
estaba muerto.
El cura fue conocido de otro cura que en la procesión venía, cuyo
conocimiento puso en sosiego el concebido temor de los dos escuadrones. El
primer cura dio al segundo, en dos razones, cuenta de quién era don
Quijote, y así él como toda la turba de los diciplinantes fueron a ver si
estaba muerto el pobre caballero, y oyeron que Sancho Panza, con lágrimas
en los ojos, decía:
— ¡Oh flor de la caballería, que con solo un garrotazo acabaste la carrera
de tus tan bien gastados años! ¡Oh honra de tu linaje, honor y gloria de
toda la Mancha, y aun de todo el mundo, el cual, faltando tú en él, quedará
lleno de malhechores, sin temor de ser castigados de sus malas fechorías!
¡Oh liberal sobre todos los Alejandros, pues por solos ocho meses de
servicio me tenías dada la mejor ínsula que el mar ciñe y rodea! ¡Oh
humilde con los soberbios y arrogante con los humildes, acometedor de
peligros, sufridor de afrentas, enamorado sin causa, imitador de los
buenos, azote de los malos, enemigo de los ruines, en fin, caballero
andante, que es todo lo que decir se puede!
Con las voces y gemidos de Sancho revivió don Quijote, y la primer palabra
que dijo fue:
— El que de vos vive ausente, dulcísima Dulcinea, a mayores miserias que
éstas está sujeto. Ayúdame, Sancho amigo, a ponerme sobre el carro
encantado, que ya no estoy para oprimir la silla de Rocinante, porque tengo
todo este hombro hecho pedazos.
— Eso haré yo de muy buena gana, señor mío —respondió Sancho—, y volvamos a
mi aldea en compañía destos señores, que su bien desean, y allí daremos
orden de hacer otra salida que nos sea de más provecho y fama.
— Bien dices, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, y será gran prudencia dejar
pasar el mal influjo de las estrellas que agora corre.
El canónigo y el cura y barbero le dijeron que haría muy bien en hacer lo
que decía; y así, habiendo recebido grande gusto de las simplicidades de
Sancho Panza, pusieron a don Quijote en el carro, como antes venía. La
procesión volvió a ordenarse y a proseguir su camino; el cabrero se
despidió de todos; los cuadrilleros no quisieron pasar adelante, y el cura
les pagó lo que se les debía. El canónigo pidió al cura le avisase el
suceso de don Quijote, si sanaba de su locura o si proseguía en ella, y con
esto tomó licencia para seguir su viaje. En fin, todos se dividieron y
apartaron, quedando solos el cura y barbero, don Quijote y Panza, y el
bueno de Rocinante, que a todo lo que había visto estaba con tanta
paciencia como su amo.
El boyero unció sus bueyes y acomodó a don Quijote sobre un haz de heno, y
con su acostumbrada flema siguió el camino que el cura quiso, y a cabo de
seis días llegaron a la aldea de don Quijote, adonde entraron en la mitad
del día, que acertó a ser domingo, y la gente estaba toda en la plaza, por
mitad de la cual atravesó el carro de don Quijote. Acudieron todos a ver lo
que en el carro venía, y, cuando conocieron a su compatrioto, quedaron
maravillados, y un muchacho acudió corriendo a dar las nuevas a su ama y a
su sobrina de que su tío y su señor venía flaco y amarillo, y tendido sobre
un montón de heno y sobre un carro de bueyes. Cosa de lástima fue oír los
gritos que las dos buenas señoras alzaron, las bofetadas que se dieron, las
maldiciones que de nuevo echaron a los malditos libros de caballerías; todo
lo cual se renovó cuando vieron entrar a don Quijote por sus puertas.
A las nuevas desta venida de don Quijote, acudió la mujer de Sancho Panza,
que ya había sabido que había ido con él sirviéndole de escudero, y, así
como vio a Sancho, lo primero que le preguntó fue que si venía bueno el
asno. Sancho respondió que venía mejor que su amo.
— Gracias sean dadas a Dios —replicó ella—, que tanto bien me ha hecho; pero
contadme agora, amigo: ¿qué bien habéis sacado de vuestras escuderías?,
¿qué saboyana me traes a mí?, ¿qué zapaticos a vuestros hijos?
— No traigo nada deso —dijo Sancho—, mujer mía, aunque traigo otras cosas de
más momento y consideración.
— Deso recibo yo mucho gusto —respondió la mujer—; mostradme esas cosas de
más consideración y más momento, amigo mío, que las quiero ver, para que se
me alegre este corazón, que tan triste y descontento ha estado en todos los
siglos de vuestra ausencia.
— En casa os las mostraré, mujer —dijo Panza—, y por agora estad contenta,
que, siendo Dios servido de que otra vez salgamos en viaje a buscar
aventuras, vos me veréis presto conde o gobernador de una ínsula, y no de
las de por ahí, sino la mejor que pueda hallarse.
— Quiéralo así el cielo, marido mío; que bien lo habemos menester. Mas,
decidme: ¿qué es eso de ínsulas, que no lo entiendo?
— No es la miel para la boca del asno —respondió Sancho—; a su tiempo lo
verás, mujer, y aun te admirarás de oírte llamar Señoría de todos tus
vasallos.
— ¿Qué es lo que decís, Sancho, de señorías, ínsulas y vasallos? —respondió
Juana Panza, que así se llamaba la mujer de Sancho, aunque no eran
parientes, sino porque se usa en la Mancha tomar las mujeres el apellido de
sus maridos.
— No te acucies, Juana, por saber todo esto tan apriesa; basta que te digo
verdad, y cose la boca. Sólo te sabré decir, así de paso, que no hay cosa
más gustosa en el mundo que ser un hombre honrado escudero de un caballero
andante buscador de aventuras. Bien es verdad que las más que se hallan no
salen tan a gusto como el hombre querría, porque de ciento que se
encuentran, las noventa y nueve suelen salir aviesas y torcidas. Sélo yo de
expiriencia, porque de algunas he salido manteado, y de otras molido; pero,
con todo eso, es linda cosa esperar los sucesos atravesando montes,
escudriñando selvas, pisando peñas, visitando castillos, alojando en ventas
a toda discreción, sin pagar, ofrecido sea al diablo, el maravedí.
Todas estas pláticas pasaron entre Sancho Panza y Juana Panza, su mujer, en
tanto que el ama y sobrina de don Quijote le recibieron, y le desnudaron, y
le tendieron en su antiguo lecho. Mirábalas él con ojos atravesados, y no
acababa de entender en qué parte estaba. El cura encargó a la sobrina
tuviese gran cuenta con regalar a su tío, y que estuviesen alerta de que
otra vez no se les escapase, contando lo que había sido menester para
traelle a su casa. Aquí alzaron las dos de nuevo los gritos al cielo; allí
se renovaron las maldiciones de los libros de caballerías, allí pidieron al
cielo que confundiese en el centro del abismo a los autores de tantas
mentiras y disparates. Finalmente, ellas quedaron confusas y temerosas de
que se habían de ver sin su amo y tío en el mesmo punto que tuviese alguna
mejoría; y sí fue como ellas se lo imaginaron.
Pero el autor desta historia, puesto que con curiosidad y diligencia ha
buscado los hechos que don Quijote hizo en su tercera salida, no ha podido
hallar noticia de ellas, a lo menos por escrituras auténticas; sólo la fama
ha guardado, en las memorias de la Mancha, que don Quijote, la tercera vez
que salió de su casa, fue a Zaragoza, donde se halló en unas famosas justas
que en aquella ciudad hicieron, y allí le pasaron cosas dignas de su valor
y buen entendimiento. Ni de su fin y acabamiento pudo alcanzar cosa alguna,
ni la alcanzara ni supiera si la buena suerte no le deparara un antiguo
médico que tenía en su poder una caja de plomo, que, según él dijo, se
había hallado en los cimientos derribados de una antigua ermita que se
renovaba; en la cual caja se habían hallado unos pergaminos escritos con
letras góticas, pero en versos castellanos, que contenían muchas de sus
hazañas y daban noticia de la hermosura de Dulcinea del Toboso, de la
figura de Rocinante, de la fidelidad de Sancho Panza y de la sepultura del
mesmo don Quijote, con diferentes epitafios y elogios de su vida y
costumbres.
Y los que se pudieron leer y sacar en limpio fueron los que aquí pone el
fidedigno autor desta nueva y jamás vista historia. El cual autor no pide a
los que la leyeren, en premio del inmenso trabajo que le costó inquerir y
buscar todos los archivos manchegos, por sacarla a luz, sino que le den el
mesmo crédito que suelen dar los discretos a los libros de caballerías, que
tan validos andan en el mundo; que con esto se tendrá por bien pagado y
satisfecho, y se animará a sacar y buscar otras, si no tan verdaderas, a lo
menos de tanta invención y pasatiempo.
Las palabras primeras que estaban escritas en el pergamino que se halló en
la caja de plomo eran éstas:
LOS ACADÉMICOS DE LA ARGAMASILLA,
LUGAR DE LA MANCHA,
EN VIDA Y MUERTE DEL VALEROSO
DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA,
HOC SCRIPSERUNT:
EL MONICONGO, ACADÉMICO DE LA ARGAMASILLA,
A LA SEPULTURA DE DON QUIJOTE
Epitafio
El calvatrueno que adornó a la Mancha
de más despojos que Jasón decreta;
el jüicio que tuvo la veleta
aguda donde fuera mejor ancha,
el brazo que su fuerza tanto ensancha,
que llegó del Catay hasta Gaeta,
la musa más horrenda y más discreta
que grabó versos en la broncínea plancha,
el que a cola dejó los Amadises,
y en muy poquito a Galaores tuvo,
estribando en su amor y bizarría,
el que hizo callar los Belianises,
aquel que en Rocinante errando anduvo,
yace debajo desta losa fría.
DEL PANIAGUADO, ACADÉMICO DE LA ARGAMASILLA,
In laudem Dulcineae del Toboso
Soneto
Esta que veis de rostro amondongado,
alta de pechos y ademán brioso,
es Dulcinea, reina del Toboso,
de quien fue el gran Quijote aficionado.
Pisó por ella el uno y otro lado
de la gran Sierra Negra, y el famoso
campo de Montïel, hasta el herboso
llano de Aranjüez, a pie y cansado.
Culpa de Rocinante, ¡oh dura estrella!,
que esta manchega dama, y este invito
andante caballero, en tiernos años,
ella dejó, muriendo, de ser bella;
y él, aunque queda en mármores escrito,
no pudo huir de amor, iras y engaños.
DEL CAPRICHOSO, DISCRETÍSIMO ACADÉMICO DE LA ARGAMASILLA,
EN LOOR DE ROCINANTE, CABALLO DE DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA
Soneto
En el soberbio trono diamantino
que con sangrientas plantas huella Marte,
frenético, el Manchego su estandarte
tremola con esfuerzo peregrino.
Cuelga las armas y el acero fino
con que destroza, asuela, raja y parte:
¡nuevas proezas!, pero inventa el arte
un nuevo estilo al nuevo paladino.
Y si de su Amadís se precia Gaula,
por cuyos bravos descendientes Grecia
triunfó mil veces y su fama ensancha,
hoy a Quijote le corona el aula
do Belona preside, y dél se precia,
más que Grecia ni Gaula, la alta Mancha.
Nunca sus glorias el olvido mancha,
pues hasta Rocinante, en ser gallardo,
excede a Brilladoro y a Bayardo.
DEL BURLADOR, ACADÉMICO ARGAMASILLESCO,
A SANCHO PANZA
Soneto
Sancho Panza es asqueste, en cuerpo chico,
Pero grande en valor: ¡milagro extraño!
Escudero el más simple y sin engaño
Que tuvo el mundo, os juro y certifico.
De ser conde no estuvo en un tantico,
Si no se conjuraran en su daño
Insolencias y agravios del tacaño
Siglo, que aun no perdonan á un borrico.
Sobre él anduvo (con perdón se miente)
Este manso escudero, tras el manso
Caballo Rocinante y tras su dueño.
¡Oh vanas esperanzas de la gente!
¡Cómo pasais con prometer descanso,
Y al fin parais en sombra, en humo, en sueño!
DEL CACHIDIABLO, ACADÉMICO DE LA ARGAMASILLA,
EN LA SEPULTURA DE DON QUIJOTE
Epitafio
Aquí yace el caballero,
bien molido y mal andante,
a quien llevó Rocinante
por uno y otro sendero.
Sancho Panza el majadero
yace también junto a él,
escudero el más fïel
que vio el trato de escudero.
DEL TIQUITOC, ACADÉMICO DE LA ARGAMASILLA,
EN LA SEPULTURA DE DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
Epitafio
Reposa aquí Dulcinea;
y, aunque de carnes rolliza,
la volvió en polvo y ceniza
la muerte espantable y fea.
Fue de castiza ralea,
y tuvo asomos de dama;
del gran Quijote fue llama,
y fue gloria de su aldea.
Éstos fueron los versos que se pudieron leer; los demás, por estar
carcomida la letra, se entregaron a un académico para que por conjeturas
los declarase. Tiénese noticia que lo ha hecho, a costa de muchas vigilias
y mucho trabajo, y que tiene intención de sacallos a luz, con esperanza de
la tercera salida de don Quijote.
Forsi altro canterà con miglior plectio.
Finis
Segunda parte del ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha
TASA
Yo, Hernando de Vallejo, escribano de Cámara del Rey nuestro señor, de los
que residen en su Consejo, doy fe que, habiéndose visto por los señores dél
un libro que compuso Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, intitulado Don Quijote
de la Mancha, Segunda parte, que con licencia de Su Majestad fue impreso,
le tasaron a cuatro maravedís cada pliego en papel, el cual tiene setenta y
tres pliegos, que al dicho respeto suma y monta docientos y noventa y dos
maravedís, y mandaron que esta tasa se ponga al principio de cada volumen
del dicho libro, para que se sepa y entienda lo que por él se ha de pedir y
llevar, sin que se exceda en ello en manera alguna, como consta y parece
por el auto y decreto original sobre ello dado, y que queda en mi poder,
a que me refiero; y de mandamiento de los dichos señores del Consejo y de
pedimiento de la parte del dicho Miguel de Cervantes, di esta fee en
Madrid, a veinte y uno días del mes de otubre del mil y seiscientos y
quince años.
Hernando de Vallejo.
FEE DE ERRATAS
Vi este libro intitulado Segunda parte de don Quijote de la Mancha,
compuesto por Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, y no hay en él cosa digna de
notar que no corresponda a su original. Dada en Madrid, a veinte y uno de
otubre, mil y seiscientos y quince.
El licenciado Francisco Murcia de la Llana.
APROBACIONES
APROBACIÓN
Por comisión y mandado de los señores del Consejo, he hecho ver el libro
contenido en este memorial: no contiene cosa contra la fe ni buenas
costumbres, antes es libro de mucho entretenimiento lícito, mezclado de
mucha filosofía moral; puédesele dar licencia para imprimirle. En Madrid, a
cinco de noviembre de mil seiscientos y quince.
Doctor Gutierre de Cetina.
APROBACIÓN
Por comisión y mandado de los señores del Consejo, he visto la Segunda
parte de don Quijote de la Mancha, por Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra: no
contiene cosa contra nuestra santa fe católica, ni buenas costumbres,
antes, muchas de honesta recreación y apacible divertimiento, que los
antiguos juzgaron convenientes a sus repúblicas, pues aun en la severa de
los lacedemonios levantaron estatua a la risa, y los de Tesalia la
dedicaron fiestas, como lo dice Pausanias, referido de Bosio, libro II De
signis Ecclesiae, cap. 10, alentando ánimos marchitos y espíritus
melancólicos, de que se acordó Tulio en el primero De legibus, y el poeta
diciendo:
Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis,
lo cual hace el autor mezclando las veras a las burlas, lo dulce a lo
provechoso y lo moral a lo faceto, disimulando en el cebo del donaire el
anzuelo de la reprehensión, y cumpliendo con el acertado asunto en que
pretende la expulsión de los libros de caballerías, pues con su buena
diligencia mañosamente alimpiando de su contagiosa dolencia a estos reinos,
es obra muy digna de su grande ingenio, honra y lustre de nuestra nación,
admiración y invidia de las estrañas. Éste es mi parecer, salvo etc. En
Madrid, a 17 de marzo de 1615.
El maestro Josef de Valdivielso.
APROBACIÓN
Por comisión del señor doctor Gutierre de Cetina, vicario general desta
villa de Madrid, corte de Su Majestad, he visto este libro de la Segunda
parte del ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, por Miguel de
Cervantes Saavedra, y no hallo en él cosa indigna de un cristiano celo, ni
que disuene de la decencia debida a buen ejemplo, ni virtudes morales;
antes, mucha erudición y aprovechamiento, así en la continencia de su bien
seguido asunto para extirpar los vanos y mentirosos libros de caballerías,
cuyo contagio había cundido más de lo que fuera justo, como en la lisura
del lenguaje castellano, no adulterado con enfadosa y estudiada afectación,
vicio con razón aborrecido de hombres cuerdos; y en la correción de vicios
que generalmente toca, ocasionado de sus agudos discursos, guarda con tanta
cordura las leyes de reprehensión cristiana, que aquel que fuere tocado de
la enfermedad que pretende curar, en lo dulce y sabroso de sus medicinas
gustosamente habrá bebido, cuando menos lo imagine, sin empacho ni asco
alguno, lo provechoso de la detestación de su vicio, con que se hallará,
que es lo más difícil de conseguirse, gustoso y reprehendido. Ha habido
muchos que, por no haber sabido templar ni mezclar a propósito lo útil con
lo dulce, han dado con todo su molesto trabajo en tierra, pues no pudiendo
imitar a Diógenes en lo filósofo y docto, atrevida, por no decir licenciosa
y desalumbradamente, le pretenden imitar en lo cínico, entregándose a
maldicientes, inventando casos que no pasaron, para hacer capaz al vicio
que tocan de su áspera reprehensión, y por ventura descubren caminos para
seguirle, hasta entonces ignorados, con que vienen a quedar, si no
reprehensores, a lo menos maestros dél. Hácense odiosos a los bien
entendidos, con el pueblo pierden el crédito, si alguno tuvieron, para
admitir sus escritos y los vicios que arrojada e imprudentemente quisieren
corregir en muy peor estado que antes, que no todas las postemas a un mismo
tiempo están dispuestas para admitir las recetas o cauterios; antes,
algunos mucho mejor reciben las blandas y suaves medicinas, con cuya
aplicación, el atentado y docto médico consigue el fin de resolverlas,
término que muchas veces es mejor que no el que se alcanza con el rigor del
hierro. Bien diferente han sentido de los escritos de Miguel de
Cervantes, así nuestra nación como las estrañas, pues como a milagro desean
ver el autor de libros que con general aplauso, así por su decoro y
decencia como por la suavidad y blandura de sus discursos, han recebido
España, Francia, Italia, Alemania y Flandes. Certifico con verdad que en
veinte y cinco de febrero deste año de seiscientos y quince, habiendo ido
el ilustrísimo señor don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, cardenal arzobispo
de Toledo, mi señor, a pagar la visita que a Su Ilustrísima hizo el
embajador de Francia, que vino a tratar cosas tocantes a los casamientos de
sus príncipes y los de España, muchos caballeros franceses, de los que
vinieron acompañando al embajador, tan corteses como entendidos y amigos de
buenas letras, se llegaron a mí y a otros capellanes del cardenal mi señor,
deseosos de saber qué libros de ingenio andaban más validos; y, tocando
acaso en éste que yo estaba censurando, apenas oyeron el nombre de Miguel
de Cervantes, cuando se comenzaron a hacer lenguas, encareciendo la
estimación en que, así en Francia como en los reinos sus confinantes, se
tenían sus obras: la Galatea, que alguno dellos tiene casi de memoria la
primera parte désta, y las Novelas. Fueron tantos sus encarecimientos,
que me ofrecí llevarles que viesen el autor dellas, que estimaron con mil
demostraciones de vivos deseos. Preguntáronme muy por menor su edad, su
profesión, calidad y cantidad. Halléme obligado a decir que era viejo,
soldado, hidalgo y pobre, a que uno respondió estas formales palabras:
''Pues, ¿a tal hombre no le tiene España muy rico y sustentado del erario
público?'' Acudió otro de aquellos caballeros con este pensamiento y con
mucha agudeza, y dijo: ''Si necesidad le ha de obligar a escribir, plega a
Dios que nunca tenga abundancia, para que con sus obras, siendo él pobre,
haga rico a todo el mundo''. Bien creo que está, para censura, un poco
larga; alguno dirá que toca los límites de lisonjero elogio; mas la verdad
de lo que cortamente digo deshace en el crítico la sospecha y en mí el
cuidado; además que el día de hoy no se lisonjea a quien no tiene con qué
cebar el pico del adulador, que, aunque afectuosa y falsamente dice de
burlas, pretende ser remunerado de veras. En Madrid, a veinte y siete de
febrero de mil y seiscientos y quince.

aquí adelante, que vos guarden y cumplan esta nuestra cédula y merced, que
ansí vos hacemos, y contra ella no vayan ni pasen en manera alguna, so pena
de la nuestra merced y de diez mil maravedís para la nuestra Cámara. Dada
en Madrid, a treinta días del mes de marzo de mil y seiscientos y quince
años.
YO, EL REY.
Por mandado del Rey nuestro señor:

PRÓLOGO AL LECTOR
¡Válame Dios, y con cuánta gana debes de estar esperando ahora, lector
ilustre, o quier plebeyo, este prólogo, creyendo hallar en él venganzas,
riñas y vituperios del autor del segundo Don Quijote; digo de aquel que
dicen que se engendró en Tordesillas y nació en Tarragona! Pues en verdad
que no te he dar este contento; que, puesto que los agravios despiertan la
cólera en los más humildes pechos, en el mío ha de padecer excepción esta
regla. Quisieras tú que lo diera del asno, del mentecato y del atrevido,
pero no me pasa por el pensamiento: castíguele su pecado, con su pan se lo
coma y allá se lo haya. Lo que no he podido dejar de sentir es que me note
de viejo y de manco, como si hubiera sido en mi mano haber detenido el
tiempo, que no pasase por mí, o si mi manquedad hubiera nacido en alguna
taberna, sino en la más alta ocasión que vieron los siglos pasados, los
presentes, ni esperan ver los venideros. Si mis heridas no resplandecen en
los ojos de quien las mira, son estimadas, a lo menos, en la estimación de
los que saben dónde se cobraron; que el soldado más bien parece muerto en
la batalla que libre en la fuga; y es esto en mí de manera, que si ahora me
propusieran y facilitaran un imposible, quisiera antes haberme hallado en
aquella facción prodigiosa que sano ahora de mis heridas sin haberme
hallado en ella. Las que el soldado muestra en el rostro y en los pechos,
estrellas son que guían a los demás al cielo de la honra, y al de desear la
justa alabanza; y hase de advertir que no se escribe con las canas, sino
con el entendimiento, el cual suele mejorarse con los años.
He sentido también que me llame invidioso, y que, como a ignorante, me
describa qué cosa sea la invidia; que, en realidad de verdad, de dos que
hay, yo no conozco sino a la santa, a la noble y bien intencionada; y,
siendo esto así, como lo es, no tengo yo de perseguir a ningún sacerdote, y
más si tiene por añadidura ser familiar del Santo Oficio; y si él lo dijo
por quien parece que lo dijo, engañóse de todo en todo: que del tal adoro
el ingenio, admiro las obras y la ocupación continua y virtuosa. Pero, en
efecto, le agradezco a este señor autor el decir que mis novelas son más
satíricas que ejemplares, pero que son buenas; y no lo pudieran ser si no
tuvieran de todo.
Paréceme que me dices que ando muy limitado y que me contengo mucho en los
términos de mi modestia, sabiendo que no se ha añadir aflición al afligido,
y que la que debe de tener este señor sin duda es grande, pues no osa
parecer a campo abierto y al cielo claro, encubriendo su nombre, fingiendo
su patria, como si hubiera hecho alguna traición de lesa majestad. Si, por
ventura, llegares a conocerle, dile de mi parte que no me tengo por
agraviado: que bien sé lo que son tentaciones del demonio, y que una de las
mayores es ponerle a un hombre en el entendimiento que puede componer y
imprimir un libro, con que gane tanta fama como dineros, y tantos dineros
cuanta fama; y, para confirmación desto, quiero que en tu buen donaire y
gracia le cuentes este cuento:
«Había en Sevilla un loco que dio en el más gracioso disparate y tema que
dio loco en el mundo. Y fue que hizo un cañuto de caña puntiagudo en el
fin, y, en cogiendo algún perro en la calle, o en cualquiera otra parte,
con el un pie le cogía el suyo, y el otro le alzaba con la mano, y como
mejor podía le acomodaba el cañuto en la parte que, soplándole, le ponía
redondo como una pelota; y, en teniéndolo desta suerte, le daba dos
palmaditas en la barriga, y le soltaba, diciendo a los circunstantes, que
siempre eran muchos: ''¿Pensarán vuestras mercedes ahora que es poco
trabajo hinchar un perro?''»
¿Pensará vuestra merced ahora que es poco trabajo hacer un libro?
Y si este cuento no le cuadrare, dirásle, lector amigo, éste, que también
es de loco y de perro:
«Había en Córdoba otro loco, que tenía por costumbre de traer encima de la
cabeza un pedazo de losa de mármol, o un canto no muy liviano, y, en
topando algún perro descuidado, se le ponía junto, y a plomo dejaba caer
sobre él el peso. Amohinábase el perro, y, dando ladridos y aullidos, no
paraba en tres calles. Sucedió, pues, que, entre los perros que descargó la
carga, fue uno un perro de un bonetero, a quien quería mucho su dueño. Bajó
el canto, diole en la cabeza, alzó el grito el molido perro, violo y
sintiólo su amo, asió de una vara de medir, y salió al loco y no le dejó
hueso sano; y cada palo que le daba decía: ''Perro ladrón, ¿a mi podenco?
¿No viste, cruel, que era podenco mi perro?'' Y, repitiéndole el nombre de
podenco muchas veces, envió al loco hecho una alheña. Escarmentó el loco y
retiróse, y en más de un mes no salió a la plaza; al cabo del cual tiempo,
volvió con su invención y con más carga. Llegábase donde estaba el perro,
y, mirándole muy bien de hito en hito, y sin querer ni atreverse a
descargar la piedra, decía: ''Este es podenco: ¡guarda!'' En efeto, todos
cuantos perros topaba, aunque fuesen alanos, o gozques, decía que eran
podencos; y así, no soltó más el canto.»
Quizá de esta suerte le podrá acontecer a este historiador: que no se
atreverá a soltar más la presa de su ingenio en libros que, en siendo
malos, son más duros que las peñas.
Dile también que de la amenaza que me hace, que me ha de quitar la ganancia
con su libro, no se me da un ardite, que, acomodándome al entremés famoso
de La Perendenga, le respondo que me viva el Veinte y cuatro, mi señor, y
Cristo con todos. Viva el gran conde de Lemos, cuya cristiandad y
liberalidad, bien conocida, contra todos los golpes de mi corta fortuna me
tiene en pie, y vívame la suma caridad del ilustrísimo de Toledo, don
Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, y siquiera no haya emprentas en el mundo, y
siquiera se impriman contra mí más libros que tienen letras las Coplas de
Mingo Revulgo. Estos dos príncipes, sin que los solicite adulación mía ni
otro género de aplauso, por sola su bondad, han tomado a su cargo el
hacerme merced y favorecerme; en lo que me tengo por más dichoso y más rico
que si la fortuna por camino ordinario me hubiera puesto en su cumbre. La
honra puédela tener el pobre, pero no el vicioso; la pobreza puede anublar
a la nobleza, pero no escurecerla del todo; pero, como la virtud dé alguna
luz de sí, aunque sea por los inconvenientes y resquicios de la estrecheza,
viene a ser estimada de los altos y nobles espíritus, y, por el
consiguiente, favorecida.
Y no le digas más, ni yo quiero decirte más a ti, sino advertirte que
consideres que esta segunda parte de Don Quijote que te ofrezco es cortada
del mismo artífice y del mesmo paño que la primera, y que en ella te doy a
don Quijote dilatado, y, finalmente, muerto y sepultado, porque ninguno se
atreva a levantarle nuevos testimonios, pues bastan los pasados y basta
también que un hombre honrado haya dado noticia destas discretas locuras,
sin querer de nuevo entrarse en ellas: que la abundancia de las cosas,
aunque sean buenas, hace que no se estimen, y la carestía, aun de las
malas, se estima en algo. Olvídaseme de decirte que esperes el Persiles,
que ya estoy acabando, y la segunda parte de Galatea.
DEDICATORIA, AL CONDE DE LEMOS
Enviando a Vuestra Excelencia los días pasados mis comedias, antes impresas
que representadas, si bien me acuerdo, dije que don Quijote quedaba
calzadas las espuelas para ir a besar las manos a Vuestra Excelencia; y
ahora digo que se las ha calzado y se ha puesto en camino, y si él allá
llega, me parece que habré hecho algún servicio a Vuestra Excelencia,
porque es mucha la priesa que de infinitas partes me dan a que le envíe
para quitar el hámago y la náusea que ha causado otro don Quijote, que, con
nombre de segunda parte, se ha disfrazado y corrido por el orbe; y el que
más ha mostrado desearle ha sido el grande emperador de la China, pues en
lengua chinesca habrá un mes que me escribió una carta con un propio,
pidiéndome, o, por mejor decir, suplicándome se le enviase, porque quería
fundar un colegio donde se leyese la lengua castellana, y quería que el
libro que se leyese fuese el de la historia de don Quijote. Juntamente con
esto, me decía que fuese yo a ser el rector del tal colegio.
Preguntéle al portador si Su Majestad le había dado para mí alguna ayuda de
costa. Respondióme que ni por pensamiento. ''Pues, hermano —le respondí
yo—, vos os podéis volver a vuestra China a las diez, o a las veinte, o a
las que venís despachado, porque yo no estoy con salud para ponerme en tan
largo viaje; además que, sobre estar enfermo, estoy muy sin dineros, y
emperador por emperador, y monarca por monarca, en Nápoles tengo al grande
conde de Lemos, que, sin tantos titulillos de colegios ni rectorías, me
sustenta, me ampara y hace más merced que la que yo acierto a desear''.
Con esto le despedí, y con esto me despido, ofreciendo a Vuestra Excelencia
los Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda, libro a quien daré fin dentro de
cuatro meses, Deo volente; el cual ha de ser o el más malo o el mejor que
en nuestra lengua se haya compuesto, quiero decir de los de
entretenimiento; y digo que me arrepiento de haber dicho el más malo,
porque, según la opinión de mis amigos, ha de llegar al estremo de bondad
posible.
Venga Vuestra Excelencia con la salud que es deseado; que ya estará
Persiles para besarle las manos, y yo los pies, como criado que soy de
Vuestra Excelencia. De Madrid, último de otubre de mil seiscientos y
quince.
Criado de Vuestra Excelencia,
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.
Capítulo Primero. De lo que el cura y el barbero pasaron con don Quijote
cerca de su enfermedad
Cuenta Cide Hamete Benengeli, en la segunda parte desta historia y tercera
salida de don Quijote, que el cura y el barbero se estuvieron casi un mes
sin verle, por no renovarle y traerle a la memoria las cosas pasadas; pero
no por esto dejaron de visitar a su sobrina y a su ama, encargándolas
tuviesen cuenta con regalarle, dándole a comer cosas confortativas y
apropiadas para el corazón y el celebro, de donde procedía, según buen
discurso, toda su mala ventura. Las cuales dijeron que así lo hacían, y lo
harían, con la voluntad y cuidado posible, porque echaban de ver que su
señor por momentos iba dando muestras de estar en su entero juicio; de lo
cual recibieron los dos gran contento, por parecerles que habían acertado
en haberle traído encantado en el carro de los bueyes, como se contó en la
primera parte desta tan grande como puntual historia, en su último
capítulo. Y así, determinaron de visitarle y hacer esperiencia de su
mejoría, aunque tenían casi por imposible que la tuviese, y acordaron de no
tocarle en ningún punto de la andante caballería, por no ponerse a peligro
de descoser los de la herida, que tan tiernos estaban.
Visitáronle, en fin, y halláronle sentado en la cama, vestida una almilla
de bayeta verde, con un bonete colorado toledano; y estaba tan seco y
amojamado, que no parecía sino hecho de carne momia. Fueron dél muy bien
recebidos, preguntáronle por su salud, y él dio cuenta de sí y de ella con
mucho juicio y con muy elegantes palabras; y en el discurso de su plática
vinieron a tratar en esto que llaman razón de estado y modos de gobierno,
enmendando este abuso y condenando aquél, reformando una costumbre y
desterrando otra, haciéndose cada uno de los tres un nuevo legislador, un
Licurgo moderno o un Solón flamante; y de tal manera renovaron la
república, que no pareció sino que la habían puesto en una fragua, y sacado
otra de la que pusieron; y habló don Quijote con tanta discreción en todas
las materias que se tocaron, que los dos esaminadores creyeron
indubitadamente que estaba del todo bueno y en su entero juicio.
Halláronse presentes a la plática la sobrina y ama, y no se hartaban de dar
gracias a Dios de ver a su señor con tan buen entendimiento; pero el cura,
mudando el propósito primero, que era de no tocarle en cosa de caballerías,
quiso hacer de todo en todo esperiencia si la sanidad de don Quijote era
falsa o verdadera, y así, de lance en lance, vino a contar algunas nuevas
que habían venido de la corte; y, entre otras, dijo que se tenía por cierto
que el Turco bajaba con una poderosa armada, y que no se sabía su designio,
ni adónde había de descargar tan gran nublado; y, con este temor, con que
casi cada año nos toca arma, estaba puesta en ella toda la cristiandad, y
Su Majestad había hecho proveer las costas de Nápoles y Sicilia y la isla
de Malta. A esto respondió don Quijote:
— Su Majestad ha hecho como prudentísimo guerrero en proveer sus estados con
tiempo, porque no le halle desapercebido el enemigo; pero si se tomara mi
consejo, aconsejárale yo que usara de una prevención, de la cual Su
Majestad la hora de agora debe estar muy ajeno de pensar en ella.
Apenas oyó esto el cura, cuando dijo entre sí:
— ¡Dios te tenga de su mano, pobre don Quijote: que me parece que te
despeñas de la alta cumbre de tu locura hasta el profundo abismo de tu
simplicidad!
Mas el barbero, que ya había dado en el mesmo pensamiento que el cura,
preguntó a don Quijote cuál era la advertencia de la prevención que decía
era bien se hiciese; quizá podría ser tal, que se pusiese en la lista de
los muchos advertimientos impertinentes que se suelen dar a los príncipes.
— El mío, señor rapador —dijo don Quijote—, no será impertinente, sino
perteneciente.
— No lo digo por tanto —replicó el barbero—, sino porque tiene mostrado la
esperiencia que todos o los más arbitrios que se dan a Su Majestad, o son
imposibles, o disparatados, o en daño del rey o del reino.
— Pues el mío —respondió don Quijote— ni es imposible ni disparatado, sino
el más fácil, el más justo y el más mañero y breve que puede caber en
pensamiento de arbitrante alguno.
— Ya tarda en decirle vuestra merced, señor don Quijote —dijo el cura.
— No querría —dijo don Quijote— que le dijese yo aquí agora, y amaneciese
mañana en los oídos de los señores consejeros, y se llevase otro las
gracias y el premio de mi trabajo.
— Por mí —dijo el barbero—, doy la palabra, para aquí y para delante de
Dios, de no decir lo que vuestra merced dijere a rey ni a roque, ni a
hombre terrenal, juramento que aprendí del romance del cura que en el
prefacio avisó al rey del ladrón que le había robado las cien doblas y la
su mula la andariega.
— No sé historias —dijo don Quijote—, pero sé que es bueno ese juramento, en
fee de que sé que es hombre de bien el señor barbero.
— Cuando no lo fuera —dijo el cura—, yo le abono y salgo por él, que en este
caso no hablará más que un mudo, so pena de pagar lo juzgado y sentenciado.
— Y a vuestra merced, ¿quién le fía, señor cura? —dijo don Quijote.
— Mi profesión —respondió el cura—, que es de guardar secreto.
— ¡Cuerpo de tal! —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—. ¿Hay más, sino mandar Su
Majestad por público pregón que se junten en la corte para un día señalado
todos los caballeros andantes que vagan por España; que, aunque no viniesen
sino media docena, tal podría venir entre ellos, que solo bastase a
destruir toda la potestad del Turco? Esténme vuestras mercedes atentos, y
vayan conmigo. ¿Por ventura es cosa nueva deshacer un solo caballero
andante un ejército de docientos mil hombres, como si todos juntos tuvieran
una sola garganta, o fueran hechos de alfenique? Si no, díganme: ¿cuántas
historias están llenas destas maravillas? ¡Había, en hora mala para mí, que
no quiero decir para otro, de vivir hoy el famoso don Belianís, o alguno de
los del inumerable linaje de Amadís de Gaula; que si alguno déstos hoy
viviera y con el Turco se afrontara, a fee que no le arrendara la ganancia!
Pero Dios mirará por su pueblo, y deparará alguno que, si no tan bravo como
los pasados andantes caballeros, a lo menos no les será inferior en el
ánimo; y Dios me entiende, y no digo más.
— ¡Ay! —dijo a este punto la sobrina—; ¡que me maten si no quiere mi señor
volver a ser caballero andante!
A lo que dijo don Quijote:
— Caballero andante he de morir, y baje o suba el Turco cuando él quisiere y
cuan poderosamente pudiere; que otra vez digo que Dios me entiende.
A esta sazón dijo el barbero:
— Suplico a vuestras mercedes que se me dé licencia para contar un cuento
breve que sucedió en Sevilla, que, por venir aquí como de molde, me da gana
de contarle.
Dio la licencia don Quijote, y el cura y los demás le prestaron atención, y
él comenzó desta manera:
— «En la casa de los locos de Sevilla estaba un hombre a quien sus parientes
habían puesto allí por falto de juicio. Era graduado en cánones por Osuna,
pero, aunque lo fuera por Salamanca, según opinión de muchos, no dejara de
ser loco. Este tal graduado, al cabo de algunos años de recogimiento, se
dio a entender que estaba cuerdo y en su entero juicio, y con esta
imaginación escribió al arzobispo, suplicándole encarecidamente y con muy
concertadas razones le mandase sacar de aquella miseria en que vivía, pues
por la misericordia de Dios había ya cobrado el juicio perdido; pero que
sus parientes, por gozar de la parte de su hacienda, le tenían allí, y, a
pesar de la verdad, querían que fuese loco hasta la muerte.
»El arzobispo, persuadido de muchos billetes concertados y discretos, mandó
a un capellán suyo se informase del retor de la casa si era verdad lo que
aquel licenciado le escribía, y que asimesmo hablase con el loco, y que si
le pareciese que tenía juicio, le sacase y pusiese en libertad. Hízolo así
el capellán, y el retor le dijo que aquel hombre aún se estaba loco: que,
puesto que hablaba muchas veces como persona de grande entendimiento, al
cabo disparaba con tantas necedades, que en muchas y en grandes igualaban a
sus primeras discreciones, como se podía hacer la esperiencia hablándole.
Quiso hacerla el capellán, y, poniéndole con el loco, habló con él una hora
y más, y en todo aquel tiempo jamás el loco dijo razón torcida ni
disparatada; antes, habló tan atentadamente, que el capellán fue forzado a
creer que el loco estaba cuerdo; y entre otras cosas que el loco le dijo
fue que el retor le tenía ojeriza, por no perder los regalos que sus
parientes le hacían porque dijese que aún estaba loco, y con lúcidos
intervalos; y que el mayor contrario que en su desgracia tenía era su mucha
hacienda, pues, por gozar della sus enemigos, ponían dolo y dudaban de la
merced que Nuestro Señor le había hecho en volverle de bestia en hombre.
Finalmente, él habló de manera que hizo sospechoso al retor, codiciosos y
desalmados a sus parientes, y a él tan discreto que el capellán se
determinó a llevársele consigo a que el arzobispo le viese y tocase con la
mano la verdad de aquel negocio.
»Con esta buena fee, el buen capellán pidió al retor mandase dar los
vestidos con que allí había entrado el licenciado; volvió a decir el retor
que mirase lo que hacía, porque, sin duda alguna, el licenciado aún se
estaba loco. No sirvieron de nada para con el capellán las prevenciones y
advertimientos del retor para que dejase de llevarle; obedeció el retor,
viendo ser orden del arzobispo; pusieron al licenciado sus vestidos, que
eran nuevos y decentes, y, como él se vio vestido de cuerdo y desnudo de
loco, suplicó al capellán que por caridad le diese licencia para ir a
despedirse de sus compañeros los locos. El capellán dijo que él le quería
acompañar y ver los locos que en la casa había. Subieron, en efeto, y con
ellos algunos que se hallaron presentes; y, llegado el licenciado a una
jaula adonde estaba un loco furioso, aunque entonces sosegado y quieto, le
dijo: ''Hermano mío, mire si me manda algo, que me voy a mi casa; que ya
Dios ha sido servido, por su infinita bondad y misericordia, sin yo
merecerlo, de volverme mi juicio: ya estoy sano y cuerdo; que acerca del
poder de Dios ninguna cosa es imposible. Tenga grande esperanza y confianza
en Él, que, pues a mí me ha vuelto a mi primero estado, también le volverá
a él si en Él confía. Yo tendré cuidado de enviarle algunos regalos que
coma, y cómalos en todo caso, que le hago saber que imagino, como quien ha
pasado por ello, que todas nuestras locuras proceden de tener los estómagos
vacíos y los celebros llenos de aire. Esfuércese, esfuércese, que el
descaecimiento en los infortunios apoca la salud y acarrea la muerte''.
»Todas estas razones del licenciado escuchó otro loco que estaba en otra
jaula, frontero de la del furioso, y, levantándose de una estera vieja
donde estaba echado y desnudo en cueros, preguntó a grandes voces quién era
el que se iba sano y cuerdo. El licenciado respondió: ''Yo soy, hermano, el
que me voy; que ya no tengo necesidad de estar más aquí, por lo que doy
infinitas gracias a los cielos, que tan grande merced me han hecho''.
''Mirad lo que decís, licenciado, no os engañe el diablo —replicó el loco—;
sosegad el pie, y estaos quedito en vuestra casa, y ahorraréis la vuelta''.
''Yo sé que estoy bueno —replicó el licenciado—, y no habrá para qué tornar
a andar estaciones''. ''¿Vos bueno? —dijo el loco—: agora bien, ello dirá;
andad con Dios, pero yo os voto a Júpiter, cuya majestad yo represento en
la tierra, que por solo este pecado que hoy comete Sevilla, en sacaros
desta casa y en teneros por cuerdo, tengo de hacer un tal castigo en ella,
que quede memoria dél por todos los siglos del los siglos, amén. ¿No sabes
tú, licenciadillo menguado, que lo podré hacer, pues, como digo, soy
Júpiter Tonante, que tengo en mis manos los rayos abrasadores con que puedo
y suelo amenazar y destruir el mundo? Pero con sola una cosa quiero
castigar a este ignorante pueblo, y es con no llover en él ni en todo su
distrito y contorno por tres enteros años, que se han de contar desde el
día y punto en que ha sido hecha esta amenaza en adelante. ¿Tú libre, tú
sano, tú cuerdo, y yo loco, y yo enfermo, y yo atado...? Así pienso llover
como pensar ahorcarme''.
»A las voces y a las razones del loco estuvieron los circustantes atentos,
pero nuestro licenciado, volviéndose a nuestro capellán y asiéndole de las
manos, le dijo: ''No tenga vuestra merced pena, señor mío, ni haga caso de
lo que este loco ha dicho, que si él es Júpiter y no quisiere llover, yo,
que soy Neptuno, el padre y el dios de las aguas, lloveré todas las veces
que se me antojare y fuere menester''. A lo que respondió el capellán:
''Con todo eso, señor Neptuno, no será bien enojar al señor Júpiter:
vuestra merced se quede en su casa, que otro día, cuando haya más comodidad
y más espacio, volveremos por vuestra merced''. Rióse el retor y los
presentes, por cuya risa se medio corrió el capellán; desnudaron al
licenciado, quedóse en casa y acabóse el cuento.»
— Pues, ¿éste es el cuento, señor barbero —dijo don Quijote—, que, por venir
aquí como de molde, no podía dejar de contarle? ¡Ah, señor rapista, señor
rapista, y cuán ciego es aquel que no vee por tela de cedazo! Y ¿es posible
que vuestra merced no sabe que las comparaciones que se hacen de ingenio a
ingenio, de valor a valor, de hermosura a hermosura y de linaje a linaje
son siempre odiosas y mal recebidas? Yo, señor barbero, no soy Neptuno, el
dios de las aguas, ni procuro que nadie me tenga por discreto no lo siendo;
sólo me fatigo por dar a entender al mundo en el error en que está en no
renovar en sí el felicísimo tiempo donde campeaba la orden de la andante
caballería. Pero no es merecedora la depravada edad nuestra de gozar tanto
bien como el que gozaron las edades donde los andantes caballeros tomaron a
su cargo y echaron sobre sus espaldas la defensa de los reinos, el amparo
de las doncellas, el socorro de los huérfanos y pupilos, el castigo de los
soberbios y el premio de los humildes. Los más de los caballeros que agora
se usan, antes les crujen los damascos, los brocados y otras ricas telas de
que se visten, que la malla con que se arman; ya no hay caballero que
duerma en los campos, sujeto al rigor del cielo, armado de todas armas
desde los pies a la cabeza; y ya no hay quien, sin sacar los pies de los
estribos, arrimado a su lanza, sólo procure descabezar, como dicen, el
sueño, como lo hacían los caballeros andantes. Ya no hay ninguno que,
saliendo deste bosque, entre en aquella montaña, y de allí pise una estéril
y desierta playa del mar, las más veces proceloso y alterado, y, hallando
en ella y en su orilla un pequeño batel sin remos, vela, mástil ni jarcia
alguna, con intrépido corazón se arroje en él, entregándose a las
implacables olas del mar profundo, que ya le suben al cielo y ya le bajan
al abismo; y él, puesto el pecho a la incontrastable borrasca, cuando menos
se cata, se halla tres mil y más leguas distante del lugar donde se
embarcó, y, saltando en tierra remota y no conocida, le suceden cosas
dignas de estar escritas, no en pergaminos, sino en bronces. Mas agora, ya
triunfa la pereza de la diligencia, la ociosidad del trabajo, el vicio de
la virtud, la arrogancia de la valentía y la teórica de la práctica de las
armas, que sólo vivieron y resplandecieron en las edades del oro y en los
andantes caballeros. Si no, díganme: ¿quién más honesto y más valiente que
el famoso Amadís de Gaula?; ¿quién más discreto que Palmerín de
Inglaterra?; ¿quién más acomodado y manual que Tirante el Blanco?; ¿quién
más galán que Lisuarte de Grecia?; ¿quién más acuchillado ni acuchillador
que don Belianís?; ¿quién más intrépido que Perión de Gaula, o quién más
acometedor de peligros que Felixmarte de Hircania, o quién más sincero que
Esplandián?; ¿quién mas arrojado que don Cirongilio de Tracia?; ¿quién más
bravo que Rodamonte?; ¿quién más prudente que el rey Sobrino?; ¿quién más
atrevido que Reinaldos?; ¿quién más invencible que Roldán?; y ¿quién más
gallardo y más cortés que Rugero, de quien decienden hoy los duques de
Ferrara, según Turpín en su Cosmografía? Todos estos caballeros, y otros
muchos que pudiera decir, señor cura, fueron caballeros andantes, luz y
gloria de la caballería. Déstos, o tales como éstos, quisiera yo que fueran
los de mi arbitrio, que, a serlo, Su Majestad se hallara bien servido y
ahorrara de mucho gasto, y el Turco se quedara pelando las barbas, y con
esto, no quiero quedar en mi casa, pues no me saca el capellán della; y si
su Júpiter, como ha dicho el barbero, no lloviere, aquí estoy yo, que
lloveré cuando se me antojare. Digo esto porque sepa el señor Bacía que le
entiendo.
— En verdad, señor don Quijote —dijo el barbero—, que no lo dije por tanto,
y así me ayude Dios como fue buena mi intención, y que no debe vuestra
merced sentirse.
— Si puedo sentirme o no —respondió don Quijote—, yo me lo sé.
A esto dijo el cura:
— Aun bien que yo casi no he hablado palabra hasta ahora, y no quisiera
quedar con un escrúpulo que me roe y escarba la conciencia, nacido de lo
que aquí el señor don Quijote ha dicho.
— Para otras cosas más —respondió don Quijote— tiene licencia el señor cura;
y así, puede decir su escrúpulo, porque no es de gusto andar con la
conciencia escrupulosa.
— Pues con ese beneplácito —respondió el cura—, digo que mi escrúpulo es que
no me puedo persuadir en ninguna manera a que toda la caterva de caballeros
andantes que vuestra merced, señor don Quijote, ha referido, hayan sido
real y verdaderamente personas de carne y hueso en el mundo; antes, imagino
que todo es ficción, fábula y mentira, y sueños contados por hombres
despiertos, o, por mejor decir, medio dormidos.
— Ése es otro error —respondió don Quijote— en que han caído muchos, que no
creen que haya habido tales caballeros en el mundo; y yo muchas veces,
con diversas gentes y ocasiones, he procurado sacar a la luz de la verdad
este casi común engaño; pero algunas veces no he salido con mi intención, y
otras sí, sustentándola sobre los hombros de la verdad; la cual verdad es
tan cierta, que estoy por decir que con mis propios ojos vi a Amadís de
Gaula, que era un hombre alto de cuerpo, blanco de rostro, bien puesto de
barba, aunque negra, de vista entre blanda y rigurosa, corto de razones,
tardo en airarse y presto en deponer la ira; y del modo que he delineado a
Amadís pudiera, a mi parecer, pintar y descubrir todos cuantos caballeros
andantes andan en las historias en el orbe, que, por la aprehensión que
tengo de que fueron como sus historias cuentan, y por las hazañas que
hicieron y condiciones que tuvieron, se pueden sacar por buena filosofía
sus faciones, sus colores y estaturas.
— ¿Que tan grande le parece a vuestra merced, mi señor don Quijote —preguntó
el barbero—, debía de ser el gigante Morgante?
— En esto de gigantes —respondió don Quijote— hay diferentes opiniones, si
los ha habido o no en el mundo; pero la Santa Escritura, que no puede
faltar un átomo en la verdad, nos muestra que los hubo, contándonos la
historia de aquel filisteazo de Golías, que tenía siete codos y medio de
altura, que es una desmesurada grandeza. También en la isla de Sicilia se
han hallado canillas y espaldas tan grandes, que su grandeza manifiesta que
fueron gigantes sus dueños, y tan grandes como grandes torres; que la
geometría saca esta verdad de duda. Pero, con todo esto, no sabré decir con
certidumbre qué tamaño tuviese Morgante, aunque imagino que no debió de ser
muy alto; y muéveme a ser deste parecer hallar en la historia donde se hace
mención particular de sus hazañas que muchas veces dormía debajo de
techado; y, pues hallaba casa donde cupiese, claro está que no era
desmesurada su grandeza.
— Así es —dijo el cura.
El cual, gustando de oírle decir tan grandes disparates, le preguntó que
qué sentía acerca de los rostros de Reinaldos de Montalbán y de don Roldán,
y de los demás Doce Pares de Francia, pues todos habían sido caballeros
andantes.
— De Reinaldos —respondió don Quijote— me atrevo a decir que era ancho de
rostro, de color bermejo, los ojos bailadores y algo saltados, puntoso y
colérico en demasía, amigo de ladrones y de gente perdida. De Roldán, o
Rotolando, o Orlando, que con todos estos nombres le nombran las historias,
soy de parecer y me afirmo que fue de mediana estatura, ancho de espaldas,
algo estevado, moreno de rostro y barbitaheño, velloso en el cuerpo y de
vista amenazadora; corto de razones, pero muy comedido y bien criado.
— Si no fue Roldán más gentilhombre que vuestra merced ha dicho —replicó el
cura—, no fue maravilla que la señora Angélica la Bella le desdeñase y
dejase por la gala, brío y donaire que debía de tener el morillo
barbiponiente a quien ella se entregó; y anduvo discreta de adamar antes la
blandura de Medoro que la aspereza de Roldán.
— Esa Angélica —respondió don Quijote—, señor cura, fue una doncella
destraída, andariega y algo antojadiza, y tan lleno dejó el mundo de sus
impertinencias como de la fama de su hermosura: despreció mil señores, mil
valientes y mil discretos, y contentóse con un pajecillo barbilucio, sin
otra hacienda ni nombre que el que le pudo dar de agradecido la amistad que
guardó a su amigo. El gran cantor de su belleza, el famoso Ariosto, por no
atreverse, o por no querer cantar lo que a esta señora le sucedió después
de su ruin entrego, que no debieron ser cosas demasiadamente honestas, la
dejó donde dijo:
Y como del Catay recibió el cetro,
quizá otro cantará con mejor plectro.
Y, sin duda, que esto fue como profecía; que los poetas también se llaman
vates, que quiere decir adivinos. Véese esta verdad clara, porque, después
acá, un famoso poeta andaluz lloró y cantó sus lágrimas, y otro famoso y
único poeta castellano cantó su hermosura.
— Dígame, señor don Quijote —dijo a esta sazón el barbero—, ¿no ha habido
algún poeta que haya hecho alguna sátira a esa señora Angélica, entre
tantos como la han alabado?
— Bien creo yo —respondió don Quijote— que si Sacripante o Roldán fueran
poetas, que ya me hubieran jabonado a la doncella; porque es propio y
natural de los poetas desdeñados y no admitidos de sus damas fingidas —o
fingidas, en efeto, de aquéllos a quien ellos escogieron por señoras de sus
pensamientos—, vengarse con sátiras y libelos (venganza, por cierto,
indigna de pechos generosos), pero hasta agora no ha llegado a mi noticia
ningún verso infamatorio contra la señora Angélica, que trujo revuelto el
mundo.
— ¡Milagro! —dijo el cura.
Y, en esto, oyeron que la ama y la sobrina, que ya habían dejado la
conversación, daban grandes voces en el patio, y acudieron todos al ruido.
Capítulo II. Que trata de la notable pendencia que Sancho Panza tuvo con la
sobrina y ama de don Quijote, con otros sujetos graciosos
Cuenta la historia que las voces que oyeron don Quijote, el cura y el
barbero eran de la sobrina y ama, que las daban diciendo a Sancho Panza,
que pugnaba por entrar a ver a don Quijote, y ellas le defendían la puerta:
— ¿Qué quiere este mostrenco en esta casa? Idos a la vuestra, hermano, que
vos sois, y no otro, el que destrae y sonsaca a mi señor, y le lleva por
esos andurriales.
A lo que Sancho respondió:
— Ama de Satanás, el sonsacado, y el destraído, y el llevado por esos
andurriales soy yo, que no tu amo; él me llevó por esos mundos, y vosotras
os engañáis en la mitad del justo precio: él me sacó de mi casa con
engañifas, prometiéndome una ínsula, que hasta agora la espero.
— Malas ínsulas te ahoguen —respondió la sobrina—, Sancho maldito. Y ¿qué
son ínsulas? ¿Es alguna cosa de comer, golosazo, comilón, que tú eres?
— No es de comer —replicó Sancho—, sino de gobernar y regir mejor que cuatro
ciudades y que cuatro alcaldes de corte.
— Con todo eso —dijo el ama—, no entraréis acá, saco de maldades y costal de
malicias. Id a gobernar vuestra casa y a labrar vuestros pegujares, y
dejaos de pretender ínsulas ni ínsulos.
Grande gusto recebían el cura y el barbero de oír el coloquio de los tres;
pero don Quijote, temeroso que Sancho se descosiese y desbuchase algún
montón de maliciosas necedades, y tocase en puntos que no le estarían bien
a su crédito, le llamó, y hizo a las dos que callasen y le dejasen entrar.
Entró Sancho, y el cura y el barbero se despidieron de don Quijote, de cuya
salud desesperaron, viendo cuán puesto estaba en sus desvariados
pensamientos, y cuán embebido en la simplicidad de sus malandantes
caballerías; y así, dijo el cura al barbero:
— Vos veréis, compadre, cómo, cuando menos lo pensemos, nuestro hidalgo sale
otra vez a volar la ribera.
No pongo yo duda en eso —respondió el barbero—, pero no me maravillo tanto
de la locura del caballero como de la simplicidad del escudero, que tan
creído tiene aquello de la ínsula, que creo que no se lo sacarán del casco
cuantos desengaños pueden imaginarse.
— Dios los remedie —dijo el cura—, y estemos a la mira: veremos en lo que
para esta máquina de disparates de tal caballero y de tal escudero, que
parece que los forjaron a los dos en una mesma turquesa, y que las locuras
del señor, sin las necedades del criado, no valían un ardite.
— Así es —dijo el barbero—, y holgara mucho saber qué tratarán ahora los
dos.
— Yo seguro —respondió el cura— que la sobrina o el ama nos lo cuenta
después, que no son de condición que dejarán de escucharlo.
En tanto, don Quijote se encerró con Sancho en su aposento; y, estando
solos, le dijo:
— Mucho me pesa, Sancho, que hayas dicho y digas que yo fui el que te saqué
de tus casillas, sabiendo que yo no me quedé en mis casas: juntos salimos,
juntos fuimos y juntos peregrinamos; una misma fortuna y una misma suerte
ha corrido por los dos: si a ti te mantearon una vez, a mí me han molido
ciento, y esto es lo que te llevo de ventaja.
— Eso estaba puesto en razón —respondió Sancho—, porque, según vuestra
merced dice, más anejas son a los caballeros andantes las desgracias que a
sus escuderos.
— Engáñaste, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—; según aquello, quando caput
dolet..., etcétera.
— No entiendo otra lengua que la mía —respondió Sancho.
— Quiero decir —dijo don Quijote— que, cuando la cabeza duele, todos los
miembros duelen; y así, siendo yo tu amo y señor, soy tu cabeza, y tú mi
parte, pues eres mi criado; y, por esta razón, el mal que a mí me toca, o
tocare, a ti te ha de doler, y a mí el tuyo.
— Así había de ser —dijo Sancho—, pero cuando a mí me manteaban como a
miembro, se estaba mi cabeza detrás de las bardas, mirándome volar por los
aires, sin sentir dolor alguno; y, pues los miembros están obligados a
dolerse del mal de la cabeza, había de estar obligada ella a dolerse
dellos.
— ¿Querrás tú decir agora, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que no me dolía
yo cuando a ti te manteaban? Y si lo dices, no lo digas, ni lo pienses;
pues más dolor sentía yo entonces en mi espíritu que tú en tu cuerpo. Pero
dejemos esto aparte por agora, que tiempo habrá donde lo ponderemos y
pongamos en su punto, y dime, Sancho amigo: ¿qué es lo que dicen de mí por
ese lugar? ¿En qué opinión me tiene el vulgo, en qué los hidalgos y en qué
los caballeros? ¿Qué dicen de mi valentía, qué de mis hazañas y qué de mi
cortesía? ¿Qué se platica del asumpto que he tomado de resucitar y volver
al mundo la ya olvidada orden caballeresca? Finalmente, quiero, Sancho, me
digas lo que acerca desto ha llegado a tus oídos; y esto me has de decir
sin añadir al bien ni quitar al mal cosa alguna, que de los vasallos leales
es decir la verdad a sus señores en su ser y figura propia, sin que la
adulación la acreciente o otro vano respeto la disminuya; y quiero que
sepas, Sancho, que si a los oídos de los príncipes llegase la verdad
desnuda, sin los vestidos de la lisonja, otros siglos correrían, otras
edades serían tenidas por más de hierro que la nuestra, que entiendo que,
de las que ahora se usan, es la dorada. Sírvate este advertimiento, Sancho,
para que discreta y bienintencionadamente pongas en mis oídos la verdad de
las cosas que supieres de lo que te he preguntado.
— Eso haré yo de muy buena gana, señor mío —respondió Sancho—, con condición
que vuestra merced no se ha de enojar de lo que dijere, pues quiere que lo
diga en cueros, sin vestirlo de otras ropas de aquellas con que llegaron a
mi noticia.
— En ninguna manera me enojaré —respondió don Quijote—. Bien puedes, Sancho,
hablar libremente y sin rodeo alguno.
— Pues lo primero que digo —dijo—, es que el vulgo tiene a vuestra merced
por grandísimo loco, y a mí por no menos mentecato. Los hidalgos dicen que,
no conteniéndose vuestra merced en los límites de la hidalguía, se ha
puesto don y se ha arremetido a caballero con cuatro cepas y dos yugadas de
tierra y con un trapo atrás y otro adelante. Dicen los caballeros que no
querrían que los hidalgos se opusiesen a ellos, especialmente aquellos
hidalgos escuderiles que dan humo a los zapatos y toman los puntos de las
medias negras con seda verde.
— Eso —dijo don Quijote— no tiene que ver conmigo, pues ando siempre bien
vestido, y jamás remendado; roto, bien podría ser; y el roto, más de las
armas que del tiempo.
— En lo que toca —prosiguió Sancho— a la valentía, cortesía, hazañas y
asumpto de vuestra merced, hay diferentes opiniones; unos dicen: "loco,
pero gracioso"; otros, "valiente, pero desgraciado"; otros, "cortés, pero
impertinente"; y por aquí van discurriendo en tantas cosas, que ni a
vuestra merced ni a mí nos dejan hueso sano.
— Mira, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—: dondequiera que está la virtud en
eminente grado, es perseguida. Pocos o ninguno de los famosos varones que
pasaron dejó de ser calumniado de la malicia. Julio César, animosísimo,
prudentísimo y valentísimo capitán, fue notado de ambicioso y algún tanto
no limpio, ni en sus vestidos ni en sus costumbres. Alejandro, a quien sus
hazañas le alcanzaron el renombre de Magno, dicen dél que tuvo sus ciertos
puntos de borracho. De Hércules, el de los muchos trabajos, se cuenta que
fue lascivo y muelle. De don Galaor, hermano de Amadís de Gaula, se murmura
que fue más que demasiadamente rijoso; y de su hermano, que fue llorón. Así
que, ¡oh Sancho!, entre las tantas calumnias de buenos, bien pueden pasar
las mías, como no sean más de las que has dicho.
— ¡Ahí está el toque, cuerpo de mi padre! —replicó Sancho.
— Pues, ¿hay más? —preguntó don Quijote.
— Aún la cola falta por desollar —dijo Sancho—. Lo de hasta aquí son tortas
y pan pintado; mas si vuestra merced quiere saber todo lo que hay acerca de
las caloñas que le ponen, yo le traeré aquí luego al momento quien se las
diga todas, sin que les falte una meaja; que anoche llegó el hijo de
Bartolomé Carrasco, que viene de estudiar de Salamanca, hecho bachiller, y,
yéndole yo a dar la bienvenida, me dijo que andaba ya en libros la historia
de vuestra merced, con nombre del Ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la
Mancha; y dice que me mientan a mí en ella con mi mesmo nombre de Sancho
Panza, y a la señora Dulcinea del Toboso, con otras cosas que pasamos
nosotros a solas, que me hice cruces de espantado cómo las pudo saber el
historiador que las escribió.
— Yo te aseguro, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que debe de ser algún sabio
encantador el autor de nuestra historia; que a los tales no se les encubre
nada de lo que quieren escribir.
— Y ¡cómo —dijo Sancho— si era sabio y encantador, pues (según dice el
bachiller Sansón Carrasco, que así se llama el que dicho tengo) que el
autor de la historia se llama Cide Hamete Berenjena!
— Ese nombre es de moro —respondió don Quijote.
— Así será —respondió Sancho—, porque por la mayor parte he oído decir que
los moros son amigos de berenjenas.
— Tú debes, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, errarte en el sobrenombre de ese
Cide, que en arábigo quiere decir señor.
— Bien podría ser —replicó Sancho—, mas, si vuestra merced gusta que yo le
haga venir aquí, iré por él en volandas.
— Harásme mucho placer, amigo —dijo don Quijote—, que me tiene suspenso lo
que me has dicho, y no comeré bocado que bien me sepa hasta ser informado
de todo.
— Pues yo voy por él —respondió Sancho.
Y, dejando a su señor, se fue a buscar al bachiller, con el cual volvió de
allí a poco espacio, y entre los tres pasaron un graciosísimo coloquio.
Capítulo III. Del ridículo razonamiento que pasó entre don Quijote, Sancho
Panza y el bachiller Sansón Carrasco
Pensativo además quedó don Quijote, esperando al bachiller Carrasco, de
quien esperaba oír las nuevas de sí mismo puestas en libro, como había
dicho Sancho; y no se podía persuadir a que tal historia hubiese, pues aún
no estaba enjuta en la cuchilla de su espada la sangre de los enemigos que
había muerto, y ya querían que anduviesen en estampa sus altas caballerías.
Con todo eso, imaginó que algún sabio, o ya amigo o enemigo, por arte de
encantamento las habrá dado a la estampa: si amigo, para engrandecerlas y
levantarlas sobre las más señaladas de caballero andante; si enemigo, para
aniquilarlas y ponerlas debajo de las más viles que de algún vil escudero
se hubiesen escrito, puesto —decía entre sí— que nunca hazañas de escuderos
se escribieron; y cuando fuese verdad que la tal historia hubiese, siendo
de caballero andante, por fuerza había de ser grandílocua, alta, insigne,
magnífica y verdadera.
Con esto se consoló algún tanto, pero desconsolóle pensar que su autor era
moro, según aquel nombre de Cide; y de los moros no se podía esperar verdad
alguna, porque todos son embelecadores, falsarios y quimeristas. Temíase no
hubiese tratado sus amores con alguna indecencia, que redundase en
menoscabo y perjuicio de la honestidad de su señora Dulcinea del Toboso;
deseaba que hubiese declarado su fidelidad y el decoro que siempre la había
guardado, menospreciando reinas, emperatrices y doncellas de todas
calidades, teniendo a raya los ímpetus de los naturales movimientos; y así,
envuelto y revuelto en estas y otras muchas imaginaciones, le hallaron
Sancho y Carrasco, a quien don Quijote recibió con mucha cortesía.
Era el bachiller, aunque se llamaba Sansón, no muy grande de cuerpo, aunque
muy gran socarrón, de color macilenta, pero de muy buen entendimiento;
tendría hasta veinte y cuatro años, carirredondo, de nariz chata y de
boca grande, señales todas de ser de condición maliciosa y amigo de
donaires y de burlas, como lo mostró en viendo a don Quijote, poniéndose
delante dél de rodillas, diciéndole:
— Déme vuestra grandeza las manos, señor don Quijote de la Mancha; que, por
el hábito de San Pedro que visto, aunque no tengo otras órdenes que las
cuatro primeras, que es vuestra merced uno de los más famosos caballeros
andantes que ha habido, ni aun habrá, en toda la redondez de la tierra.
Bien haya Cide Hamete Benengeli, que la historia de vuestras grandezas dejó
escritas, y rebién haya el curioso que tuvo cuidado de hacerlas traducir de
arábigo en nuestro vulgar castellano, para universal entretenimiento de las
gentes.
Hízole levantar don Quijote, y dijo:
— Desa manera, ¿verdad es que hay historia mía, y que fue moro y sabio el
que la compuso?
— Es tan verdad, señor —dijo Sansón—, que tengo para mí que el día de hoy
están impresos más de doce mil libros de la tal historia; si no, dígalo
Portugal, Barcelona y Valencia, donde se han impreso; y aun hay fama que se
está imprimiendo en Amberes, y a mí se me trasluce que no ha de haber
nación ni lengua donde no se traduzga.
— Una de las cosas —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote— que más debe de dar
contento a un hombre virtuoso y eminente es verse, viviendo, andar con buen
nombre por las lenguas de las gentes, impreso y en estampa. Dije con buen
nombre porque, siendo al contrario, ninguna muerte se le igualará.
— Si por buena fama y si por buen nombre va —dijo el bachiller—, solo
vuestra merced lleva la palma a todos los caballeros andantes; porque el
moro en su lengua y el cristiano en la suya tuvieron cuidado de pintarnos
muy al vivo la gallardía de vuestra merced, el ánimo grande en acometer los
peligros, la paciencia en las adversidades y el sufrimiento, así en las
desgracias como en las heridas, la honestidad y continencia en los amores
tan platónicos de vuestra merced y de mi señora doña Dulcinea del Toboso.
— Nunca —dijo a este punto Sancho Panza— he oído llamar con don a mi señora
Dulcinea, sino solamente la señora Dulcinea del Toboso, y ya en esto anda
errada la historia.
— No es objeción de importancia ésa —respondió Carrasco.
— No, por cierto —respondió don Quijote—; pero dígame vuestra merced, señor
bachiller: ¿qué hazañas mías son las que más se ponderan en esa historia?
— En eso —respondió el bachiller—, hay diferentes opiniones, como hay
diferentes gustos: unos se atienen a la aventura de los molinos de viento,
que a vuestra merced le parecieron Briareos y gigantes; otros, a la de los
batanes; éste, a la descripción de los dos ejércitos, que después
parecieron ser dos manadas de carneros; aquél encarece la del muerto que
llevaban a enterrar a Segovia; uno dice que a todas se aventaja la de la
libertad de los galeotes; otro, que ninguna iguala a la de los dos gigantes
benitos, con la pendencia del valeroso vizcaíno.
— Dígame, señor bachiller —dijo a esta sazón Sancho—: ¿entra ahí la aventura
de los yangüeses, cuando a nuestro buen Rocinante se le antojó pedir
cotufas en el golfo?
— No se le quedó nada —respondió Sansón— al sabio en el tintero: todo lo
dice y todo lo apunta, hasta lo de las cabriolas que el buen Sancho hizo en
la manta.
— En la manta no hice yo cabriolas —respondió Sancho—; en el aire sí, y aun
más de las que yo quisiera.
— A lo que yo imagino —dijo don Quijote—, no hay historia humana en el mundo
que no tenga sus altibajos, especialmente las que tratan de caballerías,
las cuales nunca pueden estar llenas de prósperos sucesos.
— Con todo eso —respondió el bachiller—, dicen algunos que han leído la
historia que se holgaran se les hubiera olvidado a los autores della
algunos de los infinitos palos que en diferentes encuentros dieron al señor
don Quijote.
— Ahí entra la verdad de la historia —dijo Sancho.
— También pudieran callarlos por equidad —dijo don Quijote—, pues las
acciones que ni mudan ni alteran la verdad de la historia no hay para qué
escribirlas, si han de redundar en menosprecio del señor de la historia. A
fee que no fue tan piadoso Eneas como Virgilio le pinta, ni tan prudente
Ulises como le describe Homero.
— Así es —replicó Sansón—, pero uno es escribir como poeta y otro como
historiador: el poeta puede contar, o cantar las cosas, no como fueron,
sino como debían ser; y el historiador las ha de escribir, no como debían
ser, sino como fueron, sin añadir ni quitar a la verdad cosa alguna.
— Pues si es que se anda a decir verdades ese señor moro —dijo Sancho—, a
buen seguro que entre los palos de mi señor se hallen los míos; porque
nunca a su merced le tomaron la medida de las espaldas que no me la tomasen
a mí de todo el cuerpo; pero no hay de qué maravillarme, pues, como dice el
mismo señor mío, del dolor de la cabeza han de participar los miembros.
— Socarrón sois, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—. A fee que no os falta
memoria cuando vos queréis tenerla.
— Cuando yo quisiese olvidarme de los garrotazos que me han dado —dijo
Sancho—, no lo consentirán los cardenales, que aún se están frescos en las
costillas.
— Callad, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, y no interrumpáis al señor bachiller, a
quien suplico pase adelante en decirme lo que se dice de mí en la referida
historia.
— Y de mí —dijo Sancho—, que también dicen que soy yo uno de los principales
presonajes della.
— Personajes que no presonajes, Sancho amigo —dijo Sansón.
— ¿Otro reprochador de voquibles tenemos? —dijo Sancho—. Pues ándense a eso,
y no acabaremos en toda la vida.
— Mala me la dé Dios, Sancho —respondió el bachiller—, si no sois vos la
segunda persona de la historia; y que hay tal, que precia más oíros hablar
a vos que al más pintado de toda ella, puesto que también hay quien diga
que anduvistes demasiadamente de crédulo en creer que podía ser verdad el
gobierno de aquella ínsula, ofrecida por el señor don Quijote, que está
presente.
— Aún hay sol en las bardas —dijo don Quijote—, y, mientras más fuere
entrando en edad Sancho, con la esperiencia que dan los años, estará más
idóneo y más hábil para ser gobernador que no está agora.
— Por Dios, señor —dijo Sancho—, la isla que yo no gobernase con los años
que tengo, no la gobernaré con los años de Matusalén. El daño está en que
la dicha ínsula se entretiene, no sé dónde, y no en faltarme a mí el
caletre para gobernarla.
— Encomendadlo a Dios, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que todo se hará bien, y
quizá mejor de lo que vos pensáis; que no se mueve la hoja en el árbol sin
la voluntad de Dios.
— Así es verdad —dijo Sansón—, que si Dios quiere, no le faltarán a Sancho
mil islas que gobernar, cuanto más una.
— Gobernador he visto por ahí —dijo Sancho— que, a mi parecer, no llegan a
la suela de mi zapato, y, con todo eso, los llaman señoría, y se sirven con
plata.
— Ésos no son gobernadores de ínsulas —replicó Sansón—, sino de otros
gobiernos más manuales; que los que gobiernan ínsulas, por lo menos han de
saber gramática.
— Con la grama bien me avendría yo —dijo Sancho—, pero con la tica, ni me
tiro ni me pago, porque no la entiendo. Pero, dejando esto del gobierno en
las manos de Dios, que me eche a las partes donde más de mí se sirva, digo,
señor bachiller Sansón Carrasco, que infinitamente me ha dado gusto que el
autor de la historia haya hablado de mí de manera que no enfadan las cosas
que de mí se cuentan; que a fe de buen escudero que si hubiera dicho de mí
cosas que no fueran muy de cristiano viejo, como soy, que nos habían de oír
los sordos.
— Eso fuera hacer milagros —respondió Sansón.
— Milagros o no milagros —dijo Sancho—, cada uno mire cómo habla o cómo
escribe de las presonas, y no ponga a troche moche lo primero que le viene
al magín.
— Una de las tachas que ponen a la tal historia —dijo el bachiller— es que
su autor puso en ella una novela intitulada El curioso impertinente; no por
mala ni por mal razonada, sino por no ser de aquel lugar, ni tiene que ver
con la historia de su merced del señor don Quijote.
— Yo apostaré —replicó Sancho— que ha mezclado el hideperro berzas con
capachos.
— Ahora digo —dijo don Quijote— que no ha sido sabio el autor de mi
historia, sino algún ignorante hablador, que, a tiento y sin algún
discurso, se puso a escribirla, salga lo que saliere, como hacía Orbaneja,
el pintor de Úbeda, al cual preguntándole qué pintaba, respondió: ''Lo que
saliere''. Tal vez pintaba un gallo, de tal suerte y tan mal parecido, que
era menester que con letras góticas escribiese junto a él: "Éste es gallo".
Y así debe de ser de mi historia, que tendrá necesidad de comento para
entenderla.
— Eso no —respondió Sansón—, porque es tan clara, que no hay cosa que
dificultar en ella: los niños la manosean, los mozos la leen, los hombres
la entienden y los viejos la celebran; y, finalmente, es tan trillada y tan
leída y tan sabida de todo género de gentes, que, apenas han visto algún
rocín flaco, cuando dicen: "allí va Rocinante". Y los que más se han dado a
su letura son los pajes: no hay antecámara de señor donde no se halle un
Don Quijote: unos le toman si otros le dejan; éstos le embisten y aquéllos
le piden. Finalmente, la tal historia es del más gustoso y menos
perjudicial entretenimiento que hasta agora se haya visto, porque en toda
ella no se descubre, ni por semejas, una palabra deshonesta ni un
pensamiento menos que católico.
— A escribir de otra suerte —dijo don Quijote—, no fuera escribir verdades,
sino mentiras; y los historiadores que de mentiras se valen habían de ser
quemados, como los que hacen moneda falsa; y no sé yo qué le movió al autor
a valerse de novelas y cuentos ajenos, habiendo tanto que escribir en los
míos: sin duda se debió de atener al refrán: "De paja y de heno...",
etcétera. Pues en verdad que en sólo manifestar mis pensamientos, mis
sospiros, mis lágrimas, mis buenos deseos y mis acometimientos pudiera
hacer un volumen mayor, o tan grande que el que pueden hacer todas las
obras del Tostado. En efeto, lo que yo alcanzo, señor bachiller, es que
para componer historias y libros, de cualquier suerte que sean, es menester
un gran juicio y un maduro entendimiento. Decir gracias y escribir donaires
es de grandes ingenios: la más discreta figura de la comedia es la del
bobo, porque no lo ha de ser el que quiere dar a entender que es simple. La
historia es como cosa sagrada; porque ha de ser verdadera, y donde está la
verdad está Dios, en cuanto a verdad; pero, no obstante esto, hay algunos
que así componen y arrojan libros de sí como si fuesen buñuelos.
— No hay libro tan malo —dijo el bachiller— que no tenga algo bueno.
— No hay duda en eso —replicó don Quijote—; pero muchas veces acontece que
los que tenían méritamente granjeada y alcanzada gran fama por sus
escritos, en dándolos a la estampa, la perdieron del todo, o la
menoscabaron en algo.
— La causa deso es —dijo Sansón— que, como las obras impresas se miran
despacio, fácilmente se veen sus faltas, y tanto más se escudriñan cuanto
es mayor la fama del que las compuso. Los hombres famosos por sus ingenios,
los grandes poetas, los ilustres historiadores, siempre, o las más veces,
son envidiados de aquellos que tienen por gusto y por particular
entretenimiento juzgar los escritos ajenos, sin haber dado algunos propios
a la luz del mundo.
— Eso no es de maravillar —dijo don Quijote—, porque muchos teólogos hay que
no son buenos para el púlpito, y son bonísimos para conocer las faltas o
sobras de los que predican.
— Todo eso es así, señor don Quijote —dijo Carrasco—, pero quisiera yo que
los tales censuradores fueran más misericordiosos y menos escrupulosos, sin
atenerse a los átomos del sol clarísimo de la obra de que murmuran; que si
aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus, consideren lo mucho que estuvo despierto,
por dar la luz de su obra con la menos sombra que pudiese; y quizá podría
ser que lo que a ellos les parece mal fuesen lunares, que a las veces
acrecientan la hermosura del rostro que los tiene; y así, digo que es
grandísimo el riesgo a que se pone el que imprime un libro, siendo de toda
imposibilidad imposible componerle tal, que satisfaga y contente a todos
los que le leyeren.
— El que de mí trata —dijo don Quijote—, a pocos habrá contentado.
— Antes es al revés; que, como de stultorum infinitus est numerus, infinitos
son los que han gustado de la tal historia; y algunos han puesto falta y
dolo en la memoria del autor, pues se le olvida de contar quién fue el
ladrón que hurtó el rucio a Sancho, que allí no se declara, y sólo se
infiere de lo escrito que se le hurtaron, y de allí a poco le vemos a
caballo sobre el mesmo jumento, sin haber parecido. También dicen que se le
olvidó poner lo que Sancho hizo de aquellos cien escudos que halló en la
maleta en Sierra Morena, que nunca más los nombra, y hay muchos que desean
saber qué hizo dellos, o en qué los gastó, que es uno de los puntos
sustanciales que faltan en la obra.
— Sancho respondió:
— Yo, señor Sansón, no estoy ahora para ponerme en cuentas ni cuentos; que
me ha tomado un desmayo de estómago, que si no le reparo con dos tragos de
lo añejo, me pondrá en la espina de Santa Lucía. En casa lo tengo, mi oíslo
me aguarda; en acabando de comer, daré la vuelta, y satisfaré a vuestra
merced y a todo el mundo de lo que preguntar quisieren, así de la pérdida
del jumento como del gasto de los cien escudos.
Y, sin esperar respuesta ni decir otra palabra, se fue a su casa.
Don Quijote pidió y rogó al bachiller se quedase a hacer penitencia con él.
Tuvo el bachiller el envite: quedóse, añadióse al ordinaro un par de
pichones, tratóse en la mesa de caballerías, siguióle el humor Carrasco,
acabóse el banquete, durmieron la siesta, volvió Sancho y renovóse la
plática pasada.
Capítulo IV. Donde Sancho Panza satisface al bachiller Sansón Carrasco de
sus dudas y preguntas, con otros sucesos dignos de saberse y de contarse
Volvió Sancho a casa de don Quijote, y, volviendo al pasado razonamiento,
dijo:
— A lo que el señor Sansón dijo que se deseaba saber quién, o cómo, o cuándo
se me hurtó el jumento, respondiendo digo que la noche misma que, huyendo
de la Santa Hermandad, nos entramos en Sierra Morena, después de la
aventura sin ventura de los galeotes y de la del difunto que llevaban a
Segovia, mi señor y yo nos metimos entre una espesura, adonde mi señor
arrimado a su lanza, y yo sobre mi rucio, molidos y cansados de las pasadas
refriegas, nos pusimos a dormir como si fuera sobre cuatro colchones de
pluma; especialmente yo dormí con tan pesado sueño, que quienquiera que fue
tuvo lugar de llegar y suspenderme sobre cuatro estacas que puso a los
cuatro lados de la albarda, de manera que me dejó a caballo sobre ella, y
me sacó debajo de mí al rucio, sin que yo lo sintiese.
— Eso es cosa fácil, y no acontecimiento nuevo, que lo mesmo le sucedió a
Sacripante cuando, estando en el cerco de Albraca, con esa misma invención
le sacó el caballo de entre las piernas aquel famoso ladrón llamado
Brunelo.
— Amaneció —prosiguió Sancho—, y, apenas me hube estremecido, cuando,
faltando las estacas, di conmigo en el suelo una gran caída; miré por el
jumento, y no le vi; acudiéronme lágrimas a los ojos, y hice una
lamentación, que si no la puso el autor de nuestra historia, puede hacer
cuenta que no puso cosa buena. Al cabo de no sé cuántos días, viniendo con
la señora princesa Micomicona, conocí mi asno, y que venía sobre él en
hábito de gitano aquel Ginés de Pasamonte, aquel embustero y grandísimo
maleador que quitamos mi señor y yo de la cadena.
— No está en eso el yerro —replicó Sansón—, sino en que, antes de haber
parecido el jumento, dice el autor que iba a caballo Sancho en el mesmo
rucio.
— A eso —dijo Sancho—, no sé qué responder, sino que el historiador se
engañó, o ya sería descuido del impresor.
— Así es, sin duda —dijo Sansón—; pero, ¿qué se hicieron los cien escudos?;
¿deshiciéronse?
Respondió Sancho:
— Yo los gasté en pro de mi persona y de la de mi mujer, y de mis hijos, y
ellos han sido causa de que mi mujer lleve en paciencia los caminos y
carreras que he andado sirviendo a mi señor don Quijote; que si, al cabo de
tanto tiempo, volviera sin blanca y sin el jumento a mi casa, negra ventura
me esperaba; y si hay más que saber de mí, aquí estoy, que responderé al
mismo rey en presona, y nadie tiene para qué meterse en si truje o no
truje, si gasté o no gasté; que si los palos que me dieron en estos viajes
se hubieran de pagar a dinero, aunque no se tasaran sino a cuatro maravedís
cada uno, en otros cien escudos no había para pagarme la mitad; y cada uno
meta la mano en su pecho, y no se ponga a juzgar lo blanco por negro y lo
negro por blanco; que cada uno es como Dios le hizo, y aun peor muchas
veces.
— Yo tendré cuidado —dijo Carrasco— de acusar al autor de la historia que si
otra vez la imprimiere, no se le olvide esto que el buen Sancho ha dicho,
que será realzarla un buen coto más de lo que ella se está.
— ¿Hay otra cosa que enmendar en esa leyenda, señor bachiller? —preguntó don
Quijote.
— Sí debe de haber —respondió él—, pero ninguna debe de ser de la
importancia de las ya referidas.
— Y por ventura —dijo don Quijote—, ¿promete el autor segunda parte?
— Sí promete —respondió Sansón—, pero dice que no ha hallado ni sabe quién
la tiene, y así, estamos en duda si saldrá o no; y así por esto como porque
algunos dicen: "Nunca segundas partes fueron buenas", y otros: "De las
cosas de don Quijote bastan las escritas", se duda que no ha de haber
segunda parte; aunque algunos que son más joviales que saturninos dicen:
"Vengan más quijotadas: embista don Quijote y hable Sancho Panza, y sea lo
que fuere, que con eso nos contentamos".
— Y ¿a qué se atiene el autor?
— A que —respondió Sansón—, en hallando que halle la historia, que él va
buscando con extraordinarias diligencias, la dará luego a la estampa,
llevado más del interés que de darla se le sigue que de otra alabanza
alguna.
A lo que dijo Sancho:
— ¿Al dinero y al interés mira el autor? Maravilla será que acierte, porque
no hará sino harbar, harbar, como sastre en vísperas de pascuas, y las
obras que se hacen apriesa nunca se acaban con la perfeción que requieren.
Atienda ese señor moro, o lo que es, a mirar lo que hace; que yo y mi señor
le daremos tanto ripio a la mano en materia de aventuras y de sucesos
diferentes, que pueda componer no sólo segunda parte, sino ciento. Debe de
pensar el buen hombre, sin duda, que nos dormimos aquí en las pajas; pues
ténganos el pie al herrar, y verá del que cosqueamos. Lo que yo sé decir es
que si mi señor tomase mi consejo, ya habíamos de estar en esas campañas
deshaciendo agravios y enderezando tuertos, como es uso y costumbre de los
buenos andantes caballeros.
No había bien acabado de decir estas razones Sancho, cuando llegaron a sus
oídos relinchos de Rocinante; los cuales relinchos tomó don Quijote por
felicísimo agüero, y determinó de hacer de allí a tres o cuatro días otra
salida; y, declarando su intento al bachiller, le pidió consejo por qué
parte comenzaría su jornada; el cual le respondió que era su parecer que
fuese al reino de Aragón y a la ciudad de Zaragoza, adonde, de allí a pocos
días, se habían de hacer unas solenísimas justas por la fiesta de San
Jorge, en las cuales podría ganar fama sobre todos los caballeros
aragoneses, que sería ganarla sobre todos los del mundo. Alabóle ser
honradísima y valentísima su determinación, y advirtióle que anduviese más
atentado en acometer los peligros, a causa que su vida no era suya, sino de
todos aquellos que le habían de menester para que los amparase y socorriese
en sus desventuras.
— Deso es lo que yo reniego, señor Sansón —dijo a este punto Sancho—, que
así acomete mi señor a cien hombres armados como un muchacho goloso a media
docena de badeas. ¡Cuerpo del mundo, señor bachiller! Sí, que tiempos hay
de acometer y tiempos de retirar; sí, no ha de ser todo "¡Santiago, y
cierra, España!" Y más, que yo he oído decir, y creo que a mi señor mismo,
si mal no me acuerdo, que en los estremos de cobarde y de temerario está el
medio de la valentía; y si esto es así, no quiero que huya sin tener para
qué, ni que acometa cuando la demasía pide otra cosa. Pero, sobre todo,
aviso a mi señor que si me ha de llevar consigo, ha de ser con condición
que él se lo ha de batallar todo, y que yo no he de estar obligado a otra
cosa que a mirar por su persona en lo que tocare a su limpieza y a su
regalo; que en esto yo le bailaré el agua delante; pero pensar que tengo de
poner mano a la espada, aunque sea contra villanos malandrines de hacha y
capellina, es pensar en lo escusado. Yo, señor Sansón, no pienso granjear
fama de valiente, sino del mejor y más leal escudero que jamás sirvió a
caballero andante; y si mi señor don Quijote, obligado de mis muchos y
buenos servicios, quisiere darme alguna ínsula de las muchas que su merced
dice que se ha de topar por ahí, recibiré mucha merced en ello; y cuando no
me la diere, nacido soy, y no ha de vivir el hombre en hoto de otro sino de
Dios; y más, que tan bien, y aun quizá mejor, me sabrá el pan desgobernado
que siendo gobernador; y ¿sé yo por ventura si en esos gobiernos me tiene
aparejada el diablo alguna zancadilla donde tropiece y caiga y me haga las
muelas? Sancho nací, y Sancho pienso morir; pero si con todo esto, de
buenas a buenas, sin mucha solicitud y sin mucho riesgo, me deparase el
cielo alguna ínsula, o otra cosa semejante, no soy tan necio que la
desechase; que también se dice: "Cuando te dieren la vaquilla, corre con la
soguilla"; y "Cuando viene el bien, mételo en tu casa".
— Vos, hermano Sancho —dijo Carrasco—, habéis hablado como un catedrático;
pero, con todo eso, confiad en Dios y en el señor don Quijote, que os ha de
dar un reino, no que una ínsula.
— Tanto es lo de más como lo de menos —respondió Sancho—; aunque sé decir al
señor Carrasco que no echara mi señor el reino que me diera en saco roto,
que yo he tomado el pulso a mí mismo, y me hallo con salud para regir
reinos y gobernar ínsulas, y esto ya otras veces lo he dicho a mi señor.
— Mirad, Sancho —dijo Sansón—, que los oficios mudan las costumbres, y
podría ser que viéndoos gobernador no conociésedes a la madre que os parió.
— Eso allá se ha de entender —respondió Sancho— con los que nacieron en las
malvas, y no con los que tienen sobre el alma cuatro dedos de enjundia de
cristianos viejos, como yo los tengo. ¡No, sino llegaos a mi condición, que
sabrá usar de desagradecimiento con alguno!
— Dios lo haga —dijo don Quijote—, y ello dirá cuando el gobierno venga; que
ya me parece que le trayo entre los ojos.
Dicho esto, rogó al bachiller que, si era poeta, le hiciese merced de
componerle unos versos que tratasen de la despedida que pensaba hacer de su
señora Dulcinea del Toboso, y que advirtiese que en el principio de cada
verso había de poner una letra de su nombre, de manera que al fin de los
versos, juntando las primeras letras, se leyese: Dulcinea del Toboso.
El bachiller respondió que, puesto que él no era de los famosos poetas que
había en España, que decían que no eran sino tres y medio, que no dejaría
de componer los tales metros, aunque hallaba una dificultad grande en su
composición, a causa que las letras que contenían el nombre eran diez y
siete; y que si hacía cuatro castellanas de a cuatro versos, sobrara una
letra; y si de a cinco, a quien llaman décimas o redondillas, faltaban tres
letras; pero, con todo eso, procuraría embeber una letra lo mejor que
pudiese, de manera que en las cuatro castellanas se incluyese el nombre de
Dulcinea del Toboso.
— Ha de ser así en todo caso —dijo don Quijote—; que si allí no va el nombre
patente y de manifiesto, no hay mujer que crea que para ella se hicieron
los metros.
Quedaron en esto y en que la partida sería de allí a ocho días. Encargó don
Quijote al bachiller la tuviese secreta, especialmente al cura y a maese
Nicolás, y a su sobrina y al ama, porque no estorbasen su honrada y
valerosa determinación. Todo lo prometió Carrasco. Con esto se despidió,
encargando a don Quijote que de todos sus buenos o malos sucesos le
avisase, habiendo comodidad; y así, se despidieron, y Sancho fue a poner en
orden lo necesario para su jornada.
Capítulo V. De la discreta y graciosa plática que pasó entre Sancho Panza y
su mujer Teresa Panza, y otros sucesos dignos de felice recordación
(Llegando a escribir el traductor desta historia este quinto capítulo, dice
que le tiene por apócrifo, porque en él habla Sancho Panza con otro estilo
del que se podía prometer de su corto ingenio, y dice cosas tan sutiles,
que no tiene por posible que él las supiese; pero que no quiso dejar de
traducirlo, por cumplir con lo que a su oficio debía; y así, prosiguió
diciendo:)
Llegó Sancho a su casa tan regocijado y alegre, que su mujer conoció su
alegría a tiro de ballesta; tanto, que la obligó a preguntarle:
— ¿Qué traés, Sancho amigo, que tan alegre venís?
A lo que él respondió:
— Mujer mía, si Dios quisiera, bien me holgara yo de no estar tan contento
como muestro.
— No os entiendo, marido —replicó ella—, y no sé qué queréis decir en eso de
que os holgáredes, si Dios quisiera, de no estar contento; que, maguer
tonta, no sé yo quién recibe gusto de no tenerle.
— Mirad, Teresa —respondió Sancho—: yo estoy alegre porque tengo determinado
de volver a servir a mi amo don Quijote, el cual quiere la vez tercera
salir a buscar las aventuras; y yo vuelvo a salir con él, porque lo quiere
así mi necesidad, junto con la esperanza, que me alegra, de pensar si podré
hallar otros cien escudos como los ya gastados, puesto que me entristece el
haberme de apartar de ti y de mis hijos; y si Dios quisiera darme de comer
a pie enjuto y en mi casa, sin traerme por vericuetos y encrucijadas, pues
lo podía hacer a poca costa y no más de quererlo, claro está que mi alegría
fuera más firme y valedera, pues que la que tengo va mezclada con la
tristeza del dejarte; así que, dije bien que holgara, si Dios quisiera, de
no estar contento.
— Mirad, Sancho —replicó Teresa—: después que os hicistes miembro de
caballero andante habláis de tan rodeada manera, que no hay quien os
entienda.
— Basta que me entienda Dios, mujer —respondió Sancho—, que Él es el
entendedor de todas las cosas, y quédese esto aquí; y advertid, hermana,
que os conviene tener cuenta estos tres días con el rucio, de manera que
esté para armas tomar: dobladle los piensos, requerid la albarda y las
demás jarcias, porque no vamos a bodas, sino a rodear el mundo, y a tener
dares y tomares con gigantes, con endriagos y con vestiglos, y a oír
silbos, rugidos, bramidos y baladros; y aun todo esto fuera flores de
cantueso si no tuviéramos que entender con yangüeses y con moros
encantados.
— Bien creo yo, marido —replicó Teresa—, que los escuderos andantes no comen
el pan de balde; y así, quedaré rogando a Nuestro Señor os saque presto de
tanta mala ventura.
— Yo os digo, mujer —respondió Sancho—, que si no pensase antes de mucho
tiempo verme gobernador de una ínsula, aquí me caería muerto.
— Eso no, marido mío —dijo Teresa—: viva la gallina, aunque sea con su
pepita; vivid vos, y llévese el diablo cuantos gobiernos hay en el mundo;
sin gobierno salistes del vientre de vuestra madre, sin gobierno habéis
vivido hasta ahora, y sin gobierno os iréis, o os llevarán, a la sepultura
cuando Dios fuere servido. Como ésos hay en el mundo que viven sin
gobierno, y no por eso dejan de vivir y de ser contados en el número de las
gentes. La mejor salsa del mundo es la hambre; y como ésta no falta a los
pobres, siempre comen con gusto. Pero mirad, Sancho: si por ventura os
viéredes con algún gobierno, no os olvidéis de mí y de vuestros hijos.
Advertid que Sanchico tiene ya quince años cabales, y es razón que vaya a
la escuela, si es que su tío el abad le ha de dejar hecho de la Iglesia.
Mirad también que Mari Sancha, vuestra hija, no se morirá si la casamos;
que me va dando barruntos que desea tanto tener marido como vos deseáis
veros con gobierno; y, en fin en fin, mejor parece la hija mal casada que
bien abarraganada.
— A buena fe —respondió Sancho— que si Dios me llega a tener algo qué de
gobierno, que tengo de casar, mujer mía, a Mari Sancha tan altamente que no
la alcancen sino con llamarla señora.
— Eso no, Sancho —respondió Teresa—: casadla con su igual, que es lo más
acertado; que si de los zuecos la sacáis a chapines, y de saya parda de
catorceno a verdugado y saboyanas de seda, y de una Marica y un tú a una
doña tal y señoría, no se ha de hallar la mochacha, y a cada paso ha de
caer en mil faltas, descubriendo la hilaza de su tela basta y grosera.
— Calla, boba —dijo Sancho—, que todo será usarlo dos o tres años; que
después le vendrá el señorío y la gravedad como de molde; y cuando no, ¿qué
importa? Séase ella señoría, y venga lo que viniere.
— Medíos, Sancho, con vuestro estado —respondió Teresa—; no os queráis alzar
a mayores, y advertid al refrán que dice: "Al hijo de tu vecino, límpiale
las narices y métele en tu casa". ¡Por cierto, que sería gentil cosa casar
a nuestra María con un condazo, o con caballerote que, cuando se le
antojase, la pusiese como nueva, llamándola de villana, hija del
destripaterrones y de la pelarruecas! ¡No en mis días, marido! ¡Para eso,
por cierto, he criado yo a mi hija! Traed vos dineros, Sancho, y el casarla
dejadlo a mi cargo; que ahí está Lope Tocho, el hijo de Juan Tocho, mozo
rollizo y sano, y que le conocemos, y sé que no mira de mal ojo a la
mochacha; y con éste, que es nuestro igual, estará bien casada, y le
tendremos siempre a nuestros ojos, y seremos todos unos, padres y hijos,
nietos y yernos, y andará la paz y la bendición de Dios entre todos
nosotros; y no casármela vos ahora en esas cortes y en esos palacios
grandes, adonde ni a ella la entiendan, ni ella se entienda.
— Ven acá, bestia y mujer de Barrabás —replicó Sancho—: ¿por qué quieres tú
ahora, sin qué ni para qué, estorbarme que no case a mi hija con quien me
dé nietos que se llamen señoría? Mira, Teresa: siempre he oído decir a mis
mayores que el que no sabe gozar de la ventura cuando le viene, que no se
debe quejar si se le pasa. Y no sería bien que ahora, que está llamando a
nuestra puerta, se la cerremos; dejémonos llevar deste viento favorable que
nos sopla.
(Por este modo de hablar, y por lo que más abajo dice Sancho, dijo el
tradutor desta historia que tenía por apócrifo este capítulo.)
— ¿No te parece, animalia —prosiguió Sancho—, que será bien dar con mi
cuerpo en algún gobierno provechoso que nos saque el pie del lodo? Y cásese
a Mari Sancha con quien yo quisiere, y verás cómo te llaman a ti doña
Teresa Panza, y te sientas en la iglesia sobre alcatifa, almohadas y
arambeles, a pesar y despecho de las hidalgas del pueblo. ¡No, sino estaos
siempre en un ser, sin crecer ni menguar, como figura de paramento! Y en
esto no hablemos más, que Sanchica ha de ser condesa, aunque tú más me
digas.
— ¿Veis cuanto decís, marido? —respondió Teresa—. Pues, con todo eso, temo
que este condado de mi hija ha de ser su perdición. Vos haced lo que
quisiéredes, ora la hagáis duquesa o princesa, pero séos decir que no será
ello con voluntad ni consentimiento mío. Siempre, hermano, fui amiga de la
igualdad, y no puedo ver entonos sin fundamentos. Teresa me pusieron en el
bautismo, nombre mondo y escueto, sin añadiduras ni cortapisas, ni
arrequives de dones ni donas; Cascajo se llamó mi padre, y a mí, por ser
vuestra mujer, me llaman Teresa Panza, que a buena razón me habían de
llamar Teresa Cascajo. Pero allá van reyes do quieren leyes, y con este
nombre me contento, sin que me le pongan un don encima, que pese tanto que
no le pueda llevar, y no quiero dar que decir a los que me vieren andar
vestida a lo condesil o a lo de gobernadora, que luego dirán: ''¡Mirad qué
entonada va la pazpuerca!; ayer no se hartaba de estirar de un copo de
estopa, y iba a misa cubierta la cabeza con la falda de la saya, en lugar
de manto, y ya hoy va con verdugado, con broches y con entono, como si no
la conociésemos''. Si Dios me guarda mis siete, o mis cinco sentidos, o los
que tengo, no pienso dar ocasión de verme en tal aprieto. Vos, hermano,
idos a ser gobierno o ínsulo, y entonaos a vuestro gusto; que mi hija ni
yo, por el siglo de mi madre, que no nos hemos de mudar un paso de nuestra
aldea: la mujer honrada, la pierna quebrada, y en casa; y la doncella
honesta, el hacer algo es su fiesta. Idos con vuestro don Quijote a
vuestras aventuras, y dejadnos a nosotras con nuestras malas venturas, que
Dios nos las mejorará como seamos buenas; y yo no sé, por cierto, quién le
puso a él don, que no tuvieron sus padres ni sus agüelos.
— Ahora digo —replicó Sancho— que tienes algún familiar en ese cuerpo.
¡Válate Dios, la mujer, y qué de cosas has ensartado unas en otras, sin
tener pies ni cabeza! ¿Qué tiene que ver el Cascajo, los broches, los
refranes y el entono con lo que yo digo? Ven acá, mentecata e ignorante
(que así te puedo llamar, pues no entiendes mis razones y vas huyendo de la
dicha): si yo dijera que mi hija se arrojara de una torre abajo, o que se
fuera por esos mundos, como se quiso ir la infanta doña Urraca, tenías
razón de no venir con mi gusto; pero si en dos paletas, y en menos de un
abrir y cerrar de ojos, te la chanto un don y una señoría a cuestas, y te
la saco de los rastrojos, y te la pongo en toldo y en peana, y en un
estrado de más almohadas de velludo que tuvieron moros en su linaje los
Almohadas de Marruecos, ¿por qué no has de consentir y querer lo que yo
quiero?
— ¿Sabéis por qué, marido? —respondió Teresa—; por el refrán que dice:
"¡Quien te cubre, te descubre!" Por el pobre todos pasan los ojos como de
corrida, y en el rico los detienen; y si el tal rico fue un tiempo pobre,
allí es el murmurar y el maldecir, y el peor perseverar de los
maldicientes, que los hay por esas calles a montones, como enjambres de
abejas.
— Mira, Teresa —respondió Sancho—, y escucha lo que agora quiero decirte;
quizá no lo habrás oído en todos los días de tu vida, y yo agora no hablo
de mío; que todo lo que pienso decir son sentencias del padre predicador
que la Cuaresma pasada predicó en este pueblo, el cual, si mal no me
acuerdo, dijo que todas las cosas presentes que los ojos están mirando se
presentan, están y asisten en nuestra memoria mucho mejor y con más
vehemencia que las cosas pasadas.
(Todas estas razones que aquí va diciendo Sancho son las segundas por quien
dice el tradutor que tiene por apócrifo este capítulo, que exceden a la
capacidad de Sancho. El cual prosiguió diciendo:)
— De donde nace que, cuando vemos alguna persona bien aderezada, y con ricos
vestidos compuesta, y con pompa de criados, parece que por fuerza nos mueve
y convida a que la tengamos respeto, puesto que la memoria en aquel
instante nos represente alguna bajeza en que vimos a la tal persona; la
cual inominia, ahora sea de pobreza o de linaje, como ya pasó, no es, y
sólo es lo que vemos presente. Y si éste a quien la fortuna sacó del
borrador de su bajeza (que por estas mesmas razones lo dijo el padre) a la
alteza de su prosperidad, fuere bien criado, liberal y cortés con todos, y
no se pusiere en cuentos con aquellos que por antigüedad son nobles, ten
por cierto, Teresa, que no habrá quien se acuerde de lo que fue, sino que
reverencien lo que es, si no fueren los invidiosos, de quien ninguna
próspera fortuna está segura.
— Yo no os entiendo, marido —replicó Teresa—: haced lo que quisiéredes, y no
me quebréis más la cabeza con vuestras arengas y retóricas. Y si estáis
revuelto en hacer lo que decís...
— Resuelto has de decir, mujer —dijo Sancho—, y no revuelto.
— No os pongáis a disputar, marido, conmigo —respondió Teresa—. Yo hablo
como Dios es servido, y no me meto en más dibujos; y digo que si estáis
porfiando en tener gobierno, que llevéis con vos a vuestro hijo Sancho,
para que desde agora le enseñéis a tener gobierno, que bien es que los
hijos hereden y aprendan los oficios de sus padres.
— En teniendo gobierno —dijo Sancho—, enviaré por él por la posta, y te
enviaré dineros, que no me faltarán, pues nunca falta quien se los preste a
los gobernadores cuando no los tienen; y vístele de modo que disimule lo
que es y parezca lo que ha de ser.
— Enviad vos dinero —dijo Teresa—, que yo os lo vistiré como un palmito.
— En efecto, quedamos de acuerdo —dijo Sancho— de que ha de ser condesa
nuestra hija.
— El día que yo la viere condesa —respondió Teresa—, ése haré cuenta que la
entierro, pero otra vez os digo que hagáis lo que os diere gusto, que con
esta carga nacemos las mujeres, de estar obedientes a sus maridos, aunque
sean unos porros.
Y, en esto, comenzó a llorar tan de veras como si ya viera muerta y
enterrada a Sanchica. Sancho la consoló diciéndole que, ya que la hubiese
de hacer condesa, la haría todo lo más tarde que ser pudiese. Con esto se
acabó su plática, y Sancho volvió a ver a don Quijote para dar orden en su
partida.
Capítulo VI. De lo que le pasó a Don Quijote con su sobrina y con su ama, y
es uno de los importantes capítulos de toda la historia
En tanto que Sancho Panza y su mujer Teresa Cascajo pasaron la impertinente
referida plática, no estaban ociosas la sobrina y el ama de don Quijote,
que por mil señales iban coligiendo que su tío y señor quería desgarrarse
la vez tercera, y volver al ejercicio de su, para ellas, mal andante
caballería: procuraban por todas las vías posibles apartarle de tan mal
pensamiento, pero todo era predicar en desierto y majar en hierro frío. Con
todo esto, entre otras muchas razones que con él pasaron, le dijo el ama:
— En verdad, señor mío, que si vuesa merced no afirma el pie llano y se está
quedo en su casa, y se deja de andar por los montes y por los valles como
ánima en pena, buscando esas que dicen que se llaman aventuras, a quien yo
llamo desdichas, que me tengo de quejar en voz y en grita a Dios y al rey,
que pongan remedio en ello.
A lo que respondió don Quijote:
— Ama, lo que Dios responderá a tus quejas yo no lo sé, ni lo que ha de
responder Su Majestad tampoco, y sólo sé que si yo fuera rey, me escusara
de responder a tanta infinidad de memoriales impertinentes como cada día le
dan; que uno de los mayores trabajos que los reyes tienen, entre otros
muchos, es el estar obligados a escuchar a todos y a responder a todos; y
así, no querría yo que cosas mías le diesen pesadumbre.
A lo que dijo el ama:
— Díganos, señor: en la corte de Su Majestad, ¿no hay caballeros?
— Sí —respondió don Quijote—, y muchos; y es razón que los haya, para adorno
de la grandeza de los príncipes y para ostentación de la majestad real.
— Pues, ¿no sería vuesa merced —replicó ella— uno de los que a pie quedo
sirviesen a su rey y señor, estándose en la corte?
— Mira, amiga —respondió don Quijote—: no todos los caballeros pueden ser
cortesanos, ni todos los cortesanos pueden ni deben ser caballeros
andantes: de todos ha de haber en el mundo; y, aunque todos seamos
caballeros, va mucha diferencia de los unos a los otros; porque los
cortesanos, sin salir de sus aposentos ni de los umbrales de la corte, se
pasean por todo el mundo, mirando un mapa, sin costarles blanca, ni padecer
calor ni frío, hambre ni sed; pero nosotros, los caballeros andantes
verdaderos, al sol, al frío, al aire, a las inclemencias del cielo, de
noche y de día, a pie y a caballo, medimos toda la tierra con nuestros
mismos pies; y no solamente conocemos los enemigos pintados, sino en su
mismo ser, y en todo trance y en toda ocasión los acometemos, sin mirar en
niñerías, ni en las leyes de los desafíos; si lleva, o no lleva, más corta
la lanza, o la espada; si trae sobre sí reliquias, o algún engaño
encubierto; si se ha de partir y hacer tajadas el sol, o no, con otras
ceremonias deste jaez, que se usan en los desafíos particulares de persona
a persona, que tú no sabes y yo sí. Y has de saber más: que el buen
caballero andante, aunque vea diez gigantes que con las cabezas no sólo
tocan, sino pasan las nubes, y que a cada uno le sirven de piernas dos
grandísimas torres, y que los brazos semejan árboles de gruesos y poderosos
navíos, y cada ojo como una gran rueda de molino y más ardiendo que un
horno de vidrio, no le han de espantar en manera alguna; antes con gentil
continente y con intrépido corazón los ha de acometer y embestir, y, si
fuere posible, vencerlos y desbaratarlos en un pequeño instante, aunque
viniesen armados de unas conchas de un cierto pescado que dicen que son más
duras que si fuesen de diamantes, y en lugar de espadas trujesen cuchillos
tajantes de damasquino acero, o porras ferradas con puntas asimismo de
acero, como yo las he visto más de dos veces. Todo esto he dicho, ama mía,
porque veas la diferencia que hay de unos caballeros a otros; y sería razón
que no hubiese príncipe que no estimase en más esta segunda, o, por mejor
decir, primera especie de caballeros andantes, que, según leemos en sus
historias, tal ha habido entre ellos que ha sido la salud no sólo de un
reino, sino de muchos.
— ¡Ah, señor mío! —dijo a esta sazón la sobrina—; advierta vuestra merced
que todo eso que dice de los caballeros andantes es fábula y mentira, y sus
historias, ya que no las quemasen, merecían que a cada una se le echase un
sambenito, o alguna señal en que fuese conocida por infame y por gastadora
de las buenas costumbres.
— Por el Dios que me sustenta —dijo don Quijote—, que si no fueras mi
sobrina derechamente, como hija de mi misma hermana, que había de hacer un
tal castigo en ti, por la blasfemia que has dicho, que sonara por todo el
mundo. ¿Cómo que es posible que una rapaza que apenas sabe menear doce
palillos de randas se atreva a poner lengua y a censurar las historias de
los caballeros andantes? ¿Qué dijera el señor Amadís si lo tal oyera? Pero
a buen seguro que él te perdonara, porque fue el más humilde y cortés
caballero de su tiempo, y, demás, grande amparador de las doncellas; mas,
tal te pudiera haber oído que no te fuera bien dello, que no todos son
corteses ni bien mirados: algunos hay follones y descomedidos. Ni todos los
que se llaman caballeros lo son de todo en todo: que unos son de oro, otros
de alquimia, y todos parecen caballeros, pero no todos pueden estar al
toque de la piedra de la verdad. Hombres bajos hay que revientan por
parecer caballeros, y caballeros altos hay que parece que aposta mueren por
parecer hombres bajos; aquéllos se llevantan o con la ambición o con la
virtud, éstos se abajan o con la flojedad o con el vicio; y es menester
aprovecharnos del conocimiento discreto para distinguir estas dos maneras
de caballeros, tan parecidos en los nombres y tan distantes en las
acciones.
— ¡Válame Dios! —dijo la sobrina—. ¡Que sepa vuestra merced tanto, señor
tío, que, si fuese menester en una necesidad, podría subir en un púlpito e
irse a predicar por esas calles, y que, con todo esto, dé en una ceguera
tan grande y en una sandez tan conocida, que se dé a entender que es
valiente, siendo viejo, que tiene fuerzas, estando enfermo, y que endereza
tuertos, estando por la edad agobiado, y, sobre todo, que es caballero, no
lo siendo; porque, aunque lo puedan ser los hidalgos, no lo son los pobres!
— Tienes mucha razón, sobrina, en lo que dices —respondió don Quijote—, y
cosas te pudiera yo decir cerca de los linajes, que te admiraran; pero, por
no mezclar lo divino con lo humano, no las digo. Mirad, amigas: a cuatro
suertes de linajes, y estadme atentas, se pueden reducir todos los que hay
en el mundo, que son éstas: unos, que tuvieron principios humildes, y se
fueron estendiendo y dilatando hasta llegar a una suma grandeza; otros, que
tuvieron principios grandes, y los fueron conservando y los conservan y
mantienen en el ser que comenzaron; otros, que, aunque tuvieron principios
grandes, acabaron en punta, como pirámide, habiendo diminuido y aniquilado
su principio hasta parar en nonada, como lo es la punta de la pirámide, que
respeto de su basa o asiento no es nada; otros hay, y éstos son los más,
que ni tuvieron principio bueno ni razonable medio, y así tendrán el fin,
sin nombre, como el linaje de la gente plebeya y ordinaria. De los
primeros, que tuvieron principio humilde y subieron a la grandeza que agora
conservan, te sirva de ejemplo la Casa Otomana, que, de un humilde y bajo
pastor que le dio principio, está en la cumbre que le vemos. Del segundo
linaje, que tuvo principio en grandeza y la conserva sin aumentarla, serán
ejemplo muchos príncipes que por herencia lo son, y se conservan en ella,
sin aumentarla ni diminuirla, conteniéndose en los límites de sus estados
pacíficamente. De los que comenzaron grandes y acabaron en punta hay
millares de ejemplos, porque todos los Faraones y Tolomeos de Egipto, los
Césares de Roma, con toda la caterva, si es que se le puede dar este
nombre, de infinitos príncipes, monarcas, señores, medos, asirios, persas,
griegos y bárbaros, todos estos linajes y señoríos han acabado en punta y
en nonada, así ellos como los que les dieron principio, pues no será
posible hallar agora ninguno de sus decendientes, y si le hallásemos, sería
en bajo y humilde estado. Del linaje plebeyo no tengo qué decir, sino que
sirve sólo de acrecentar el número de los que viven, sin que merezcan otra
fama ni otro elogio sus grandezas. De todo lo dicho quiero que infiráis,
bobas mías, que es grande la confusión que hay entre los linajes, y que
solos aquéllos parecen grandes y ilustres que lo muestran en la virtud, y
en la riqueza y liberalidad de sus dueños. Dije virtudes, riquezas y
liberalidades, porque el grande que fuere vicioso será vicioso grande, y el
rico no liberal será un avaro mendigo; que al poseedor de las riquezas no
le hace dichoso el tenerlas, sino el gastarlas, y no el gastarlas
comoquiera, sino el saberlas bien gastar. Al caballero pobre no le queda
otro camino para mostrar que es caballero sino el de la virtud, siendo
afable, bien criado, cortés y comedido, y oficioso; no soberbio, no
arrogante, no murmurador, y, sobre todo, caritativo; que con dos maravedís
que con ánimo alegre dé al pobre se mostrará tan liberal como el que a
campana herida da limosna, y no habrá quien le vea adornado de las
referidas virtudes que, aunque no le conozca, deje de juzgarle y tenerle
por de buena casta, y el no serlo sería milagro; y siempre la alabanza fue
premio de la virtud, y los virtuosos no pueden dejar de ser alabados. Dos
caminos hay, hijas, por donde pueden ir los hombres a llegar a ser ricos y
honrados: el uno es el de las letras; otro, el de las armas. Yo tengo más
armas que letras, y nací, según me inclino a las armas, debajo de la
influencia del planeta Marte; así que, casi me es forzoso seguir por su
camino, y por él tengo de ir a pesar de todo el mundo, y será en balde
cansaros en persuadirme a que no quiera yo lo que los cielos quieren, la
fortuna ordena y la razón pide, y, sobre todo, mi voluntad desea. Pues con
saber, como sé, los innumerables trabajos que son anejos al andante
caballería, sé también los infinitos bienes que se alcanzan con ella; y sé
que la senda de la virtud es muy estrecha, y el camino del vicio, ancho y
espacioso; y sé que sus fines y paraderos son diferentes, porque el del
vicio, dilatado y espacioso, acaba en la muerte, y el de la virtud, angosto
y trabajoso, acaba en vida, y no en vida que se acaba, sino en la que no
tendrá fin; y sé, como dice el gran poeta castellano nuestro, que
Por estas asperezas se camina
de la inmortalidad al alto asiento,
do nunca arriba quien de allí declina.
— ¡Ay, desdichada de mí —dijo la sobrina—, que también mi señor es poeta!.
Todo lo sabe, todo lo alcanza: yo apostaré que si quisiera ser albañil, que
supiera fabricar una casa como una jaula.
Yo te prometo, sobrina —respondió don Quijote—, que si estos pensamientos
caballerescos no me llevasen tras sí todos los sentidos, que no habría cosa
que yo no hiciese, ni curiosidad que no saliese de mis manos, especialmente
jaulas y palillos de dientes.
A este tiempo, llamaron a la puerta, y, preguntando quién llamaba,
respondió Sancho Panza que él era; y, apenas le hubo conocido el ama,
cuando corrió a esconderse por no verle: tanto le aborrecía. Abrióle la
sobrina, salió a recebirle con los brazos abiertos su señor don Quijote, y
encerráronse los dos en su aposento, donde tuvieron otro coloquio, que no
le hace ventaja el pasado.
Capítulo VII. De lo que pasó don Quijote con su escudero, con otros
sucesos famosísimos
Apenas vio el ama que Sancho Panza se encerraba con su señor, cuando dio en
la cuenta de sus tratos; y, imaginando que de aquella consulta había de
salir la resolución de su tercera salida y tomando su manto, toda llena de
congoja y pesadumbre, se fue a buscar al bachiller Sansón Carrasco,
pareciéndole que, por ser bien hablado y amigo fresco de su señor, le
podría persuadir a que dejase tan desvariado propósito.
Hallóle paseándose por el patio de su casa, y, viéndole, se dejó caer ante
sus pies, trasudando y congojosa. Cuando la vio Carrasco con muestras tan
doloridas y sobresaltadas, le dijo:
— ¿Qué es esto, señora ama? ¿Qué le ha acontecido, que parece que se le
quiere arrancar el alma?
— No es nada, señor Sansón mío, sino que mi amo se sale; ¡sálese sin duda!
— Y ¿por dónde se sale, señora? —preguntó Sansón—. ¿Hásele roto alguna parte
de su cuerpo?
— No se sale —respondió ella—, sino por la puerta de su locura. Quiero
decir, señor bachiller de mi ánima, que quiere salir otra vez, que con ésta
será la tercera, a buscar por ese mundo lo que él llama venturas, que yo no
puedo entender cómo les da este nombre. La vez primera nos le volvieron
atravesado sobre un jumento, molido a palos. La segunda vino en un carro de
bueyes, metido y encerrado en una jaula, adonde él se daba a entender que
estaba encantado; y venía tal el triste, que no le conociera la madre que
le parió: flaco, amarillo, los ojos hundidos en los últimos camaranchones
del celebro, que, para haberle de volver algún tanto en sí, gasté más de
seiscientos huevos, como lo sabe Dios y todo el mundo, y mis gallinas, que
no me dejaran mentir.
— Eso creo yo muy bien —respondió el bachiller—; que ellas son tan buenas,
tan gordas y tan bien criadas, que no dirán una cosa por otra, si
reventasen. En efecto, señora ama: ¿no hay otra cosa, ni ha sucedido otro
desmán alguno, sino el que se teme que quiere hacer el señor don Quijote?
— No, señor —respondió ella.
— Pues no tenga pena —respondió el bachiller—, sino váyase en hora buena a
su casa, y téngame aderezado de almorzar alguna cosa caliente, y, de
camino, vaya rezando la oración de Santa Apolonia si es que la sabe, que yo
iré luego allá, y verá maravillas.
— ¡Cuitada de mí! —replicó el ama—; ¿la oración de Santa Apolonia dice
vuestra merced que rece?: eso fuera si mi amo lo hubiera de las muelas,
pero no lo ha sino de los cascos.
— Yo sé lo que digo, señora ama: váyase y no se ponga a disputar conmigo,
pues sabe que soy bachiller por Salamanca, que no hay más que bachillear
— respondió Carrasco.
Y con esto, se fue el ama, y el bachiller fue luego a buscar al cura, a
comunicar con él lo que se dirá a su tiempo.
En el que estuvieron encerrados don Quijote y Sancho, pasaron las razones
que con mucha puntualidad y verdadera relación cuenta la historia.
Dijo Sancho a su amo:
— Señor, ya yo tengo relucida a mi mujer a que me deje ir con vuestra merced
adonde quisiere llevarme.
— Reducida has de decir, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que no relucida.
— Una o dos veces —respondió Sancho—, si mal no me acuerdo, he suplicado a
vuestra merced que no me emiende los vocablos, si es que entiende lo que
quiero decir en ellos, y que, cuando no los entienda, diga: ''Sancho, o
diablo, no te entiendo''; y si yo no me declarare, entonces podrá
emendarme; que yo soy tan fócil...
— No te entiendo, Sancho —dijo luego don Quijote—, pues no sé qué quiere
decir soy tan fócil.
— Tan fócil quiere decir —respondió Sancho— soy tan así.
— Menos te entiendo agora —replicó don Quijote.
— Pues si no me puede entender —respondió Sancho—, no sé cómo lo diga: no sé
más, y Dios sea conmigo.
— Ya, ya caigo —respondió don Quijote— en ello: tú quieres decir que eres
tan dócil, blando y mañero que tomarás lo que yo te dijere, y pasarás por
lo que te enseñare.
— Apostaré yo —dijo Sancho— que desde el emprincipio me caló y me entendió,
sino que quiso turbarme por oírme decir otras docientas patochadas.
— Podrá ser —replicó don Quijote—. Y, en efecto, ¿qué dice Teresa?
— Teresa dice —dijo Sancho— que ate bien mi dedo con vuestra merced, y que
hablen cartas y callen barbas, porque quien destaja no baraja, pues más
vale un toma que dos te daré. Y yo digo que el consejo de la mujer es poco,
y el que no le toma es loco.
— Y yo lo digo también —respondió don Quijote—. Decid, Sancho amigo; pasá
adelante, que habláis hoy de perlas.
— Es el caso —replicó Sancho— que, como vuestra merced mejor sabe, todos
estamos sujetos a la muerte, y que hoy somos y mañana no, y que tan presto
se va el cordero como el carnero, y que nadie puede prometerse en este
mundo más horas de vida de las que Dios quisiere darle, porque la muerte es
sorda, y, cuando llega a llamar a las puertas de nuestra vida, siempre va
depriesa y no la harán detener ni ruegos, ni fuerzas, ni ceptros, ni
mitras, según es pública voz y fama, y según nos lo dicen por esos
púlpitos.
— Todo eso es verdad —dijo don Quijote—, pero no sé dónde vas a parar.
— Voy a parar —dijo Sancho— en que vuesa merced me señale salario conocido
de lo que me ha de dar cada mes el tiempo que le sirviere, y que el tal
salario se me pague de su hacienda; que no quiero estar a mercedes, que
llegan tarde, o mal, o nunca; con lo mío me ayude Dios. En fin, yo quiero
saber lo que gano, poco o mucho que sea, que sobre un huevo pone la
gallina, y muchos pocos hacen un mucho, y mientras se gana algo no se
pierde nada. Verdad sea que si sucediese, lo cual ni lo creo ni lo espero,
que vuesa merced me diese la ínsula que me tiene prometida, no soy tan
ingrato, ni llevo las cosas tan por los cabos, que no querré que se aprecie
lo que montare la renta de la tal ínsula, y se descuente de mi salario gata
por cantidad.
— Sancho amigo —respondió don Quijote—, a las veces, tan buena suele ser una
gata como una rata.
— Ya entiendo —dijo Sancho—: yo apostaré que había de decir rata, y no gata;
pero no importa nada, pues vuesa merced me ha entendido.
— Y tan entendido —respondió don Quijote— que he penetrado lo último de tus
pensamientos, y sé al blanco que tiras con las inumerables saetas de tus
refranes. Mira, Sancho: yo bien te señalaría salario, si hubiera hallado en
alguna de las historias de los caballeros andantes ejemplo que me
descubriese y mostrase, por algún pequeño resquicio, qué es lo que solían
ganar cada mes, o cada año; pero yo he leído todas o las más de sus
historias, y no me acuerdo haber leído que ningún caballero andante haya
señalado conocido salario a su escudero. Sólo sé que todos servían a
merced, y que, cuando menos se lo pensaban, si a sus señores les había
corrido bien la suerte, se hallaban premiados con una ínsula, o con otra
cosa equivalente, y, por lo menos, quedaban con título y señoría. Si con
estas esperanzas y aditamentos vos, Sancho, gustáis de volver a servirme,
sea en buena hora: que pensar que yo he de sacar de sus términos y quicios
la antigua usanza de la caballería andante es pensar en lo escusado. Así
que, Sancho mío, volveos a vuestra casa, y declarad a vuestra Teresa mi
intención; y si ella gustare y vos gustáredes de estar a merced conmigo,
bene quidem; y si no, tan amigos como de antes; que si al palomar no le
falta cebo, no le faltarán palomas. Y advertid, hijo, que vale más buena
esperanza que ruin posesión, y buena queja que mala paga. Hablo de esta
manera, Sancho, por daros a entender que también como vos sé yo arrojar
refranes como llovidos. Y, finalmente, quiero decir, y os digo, que si no
queréis venir a merced conmigo y correr la suerte que yo corriere, que Dios
quede con vos y os haga un santo; que a mí no me faltarán escuderos más
obedientes, más solícitos, y no tan empachados ni tan habladores como vos.
Cuando Sancho oyó la firme resolución de su amo se le anubló el cielo y se
le cayeron las alas del corazón, porque tenía creído que su señor no se
iría sin él por todos los haberes del mundo; y así, estando suspenso y
pensativo, entró Sansón Carrasco y la sobrina, deseosos de oír con qué
razones persuadía a su señor que no tornarse a buscar las aventuras. Llegó
Sansón, socarrón famoso, y, abrazándole como la vez primera y con voz
levantada, le dijo:
— ¡Oh flor de la andante caballería; oh luz resplandeciente de las armas; oh
honor y espejo de la nación española! Plega a Dios todopoderoso, donde más
largamente se contiene, que la persona o personas que pusieren impedimento
y estorbaren tu tercera salida, que no la hallen en el laberinto de sus
deseos, ni jamás se les cumpla lo que mal desearen.
Y, volviéndose al ama, le dijo:
— Bien puede la señora ama no rezar más la oración de Santa Apolonia, que yo
sé que es determinación precisa de las esferas que el señor don Quijote
vuelva a ejecutar sus altos y nuevos pensamientos, y yo encargaría mucho mi
conciencia si no intimase y persuadiese a este caballero que no tenga más
tiempo encogida y detenida la fuerza de su valeroso brazo y la bondad de su
ánimo valentísimo, porque defrauda con su tardanza el derecho de los
tuertos, el amparo de los huérfanos, la honra de las doncellas, el favor de
las viudas y el arrimo de las casadas, y otras cosas deste jaez, que tocan,
atañen, dependen y son anejas a la orden de la caballería andante. ¡Ea,
señor don Quijote mío, hermoso y bravo, antes hoy que mañana se ponga
vuestra merced y su grandeza en camino; y si alguna cosa faltare para
ponerle en ejecución, aquí estoy yo para suplirla con mi persona y
hacienda; y si fuere necesidad servir a tu magnificencia de escudero, lo
tendré a felicísima ventura!
A esta sazón, dijo don Quijote, volviéndose a Sancho:
— ¿No te dije yo, Sancho, que me habían de sobrar escuderos? Mira quién se
ofrece a serlo, sino el inaudito bachiller Sansón Carrasco, perpetuo
trastulo y regocijador de los patios de las escuelas salmanticenses, sano
de su persona, ágil de sus miembros, callado, sufridor así del calor como
del frío, así de la hambre como de la sed, con todas aquellas partes que se
requieren para ser escudero de un caballero andante. Pero no permita el
cielo que, por seguir mi gusto, desjarrete y quiebre la coluna de las
letras y el vaso de las ciencias, y tronque la palma eminente de las buenas
y liberales artes. Quédese el nuevo Sansón en su patria, y, honrándola,
honre juntamente las canas de sus ancianos padres; que yo con cualquier
escudero estaré contento, ya que Sancho no se digna de venir conmigo.
— Sí digno —respondió Sancho, enternecido y llenos de lágrimas los ojos; y
prosiguió—: No se dirá por mí, señor mío: el pan comido y la compañía
deshecha; sí, que no vengo yo de alguna alcurnia desagradecida, que ya sabe
todo el mundo, y especialmente mi pueblo, quién fueron los Panzas, de quien
yo deciendo, y más, que tengo conocido y calado por muchas buenas obras, y
por más buenas palabras, el deseo que vuestra merced tiene de hacerme
merced; y si me he puesto en cuentas de tanto más cuanto acerca de mi
salario, ha sido por complacer a mi mujer; la cual, cuando toma la mano a
persuadir una cosa, no hay mazo que tanto apriete los aros de una cuba como
ella aprieta a que se haga lo que quiere; pero, en efeto, el hombre ha de
ser hombre, y la mujer, mujer; y, pues yo soy hombre dondequiera, que no lo
puedo negar, también lo quiero ser en mi casa, pese a quien pesare; y así,
no hay más que hacer, sino que vuestra merced ordene su testamento con su
codicilo, en modo que no se pueda revolcar, y pongámonos luego en camino,
porque no padezca el alma del señor Sansón, que dice que su conciencia le
lita que persuada a vuestra merced a salir vez tercera por ese mundo; y yo
de nuevo me ofrezco a servir a vuestra merced fiel y legalmente, tan bien y
mejor que cuantos escuderos han servido a caballeros andantes en los
pasados y presentes tiempos.
Admirado quedó el bachiller de oír el término y modo de hablar de Sancho
Panza; que, puesto que había leído la primera historia de su señor, nunca
creyó que era tan gracioso como allí le pintan; pero, oyéndole decir ahora
testamento y codicilo que no se pueda revolcar, en lugar de testamento y
codicilo que no se pueda revocar, creyó todo lo que dél había leído, y
confirmólo por uno de los más solenes mentecatos de nuestros siglos; y dijo
entre sí que tales dos locos como amo y mozo no se habrían visto en el
mundo.
Finalmente, don Quijote y Sancho se abrazaron y quedaron amigos, y con
parecer y beneplácito del gran Carrasco, que por entonces era su oráculo,
se ordenó que de allí a tres días fuese su partida; en los cuales habría
lugar de aderezar lo necesario para el viaje, y de buscar una celada de
encaje, que en todas maneras dijo don Quijote que la había de llevar.
Ofreciósela Sansón, porque sabía no se la negaría un amigo suyo que la
tenía, puesto que estaba más escura por el orín y el moho que clara y
limpia por el terso acero.
Las maldiciones que las dos, ama y sobrina, echaron al bachiller no
tuvieron cuento: mesaron sus cabellos, arañaron sus rostros, y, al modo de
las endechaderas que se usaban, lamentaban la partida como si fuera la
muerte de su señor. El designo que tuvo Sansón, para persuadirle a que otra
vez saliese, fue hacer lo que adelante cuenta la historia, todo por consejo
del cura y del barbero, con quien él antes lo había comunicado.
En resolución, en aquellos tres días don Quijote y Sancho se acomodaron de
lo que les pareció convenirles; y, habiendo aplacado Sancho a su mujer, y
don Quijote a su sobrina y a su ama, al anochecer, sin que nadie lo viese,
sino el bachiller, que quiso acompañarles media legua del lugar, se
pusieron en camino del Toboso: don Quijote sobre su buen Rocinante, y
Sancho sobre su antiguo rucio, proveídas las alforjas de cosas tocantes a
la bucólica, y la bolsa de dineros que le dio don Quijote para lo que se
ofreciese. Abrazóle Sansón, y suplicóle le avisase de su buena o mala
suerte, para alegrarse con ésta o entristecerse con aquélla, como las leyes
de su amistad pedían. Prometióselo don Quijote, dio Sansón la vuelta a su
lugar, y los dos tomaron la de la gran ciudad del Toboso.
Capítulo VIII. Donde se cuenta lo que le sucedió a don Quijote, yendo a ver
su señora Dulcinea del Toboso
''¡Bendito sea el poderoso Alá! —dice Hamete Benengeli al comienzo deste
octavo capítulo—. ¡Bendito sea Alá!'', repite tres veces; y dice que da
estas bendiciones por ver que tiene ya en campaña a don Quijote y a Sancho,
y que los letores de su agradable historia pueden hacer cuenta que desde
este punto comienzan las hazañas y donaires de don Quijote y de su
escudero; persuádeles que se les olviden las pasadas caballerías del
ingenioso hidalgo, y pongan los ojos en las que están por venir, que desde
agora en el camino del Toboso comienzan, como las otras comenzaron en los
campos de Montiel, y no es mucho lo que pide para tanto como él promete; y
así prosigue diciendo:
Solos quedaron don Quijote y Sancho, y, apenas se hubo apartado Sansón,
cuando comenzó a relinchar Rocinante y a sospirar el rucio, que de
entrambos, caballero y escudero, fue tenido a buena señal y por felicísimo
agüero; aunque, si se ha de contar la verdad, más fueron los sospiros y
rebuznos del rucio que los relinchos del rocín, de donde coligió Sancho que
su ventura había de sobrepujar y ponerse encima de la de su señor,
fundándose no sé si en astrología judiciaria que él se sabía, puesto que la
historia no lo declara; sólo le oyeron decir que, cuando tropezaba o caía,
se holgara no haber salido de casa, porque del tropezar o caer no se sacaba
otra cosa sino el zapato roto o las costillas quebradas; y, aunque tonto,
no andaba en esto muy fuera de camino. Díjole don Quijote:
— Sancho amigo, la noche se nos va entrando a más andar, y con más escuridad
de la que habíamos menester para alcanzar a ver con el día al Toboso,
adonde tengo determinado de ir antes que en otra aventura me ponga, y allí
tomaré la bendición y buena licencia de la sin par Dulcinea, con la cual
licencia pienso y tengo por cierto de acabar y dar felice cima a toda
peligrosa aventura, porque ninguna cosa desta vida hace más valientes a los
caballeros andantes que verse favorecidos de sus damas.
— Yo así lo creo —respondió Sancho—; pero tengo por dificultoso que vuestra
merced pueda hablarla ni verse con ella, en parte, a lo menos, que pueda
recebir su bendición, si ya no se la echa desde las bardas del corral, por
donde yo la vi la vez primera, cuando le llevé la carta donde iban las
nuevas de las sandeces y locuras que vuestra merced quedaba haciendo en el
corazón de Sierra Morena.
— ¿Bardas de corral se te antojaron aquéllas, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—,
adonde o por donde viste aquella jamás bastantemente alabada gentileza y
hermosura? No debían de ser sino galerías o corredores, o lonjas, o como
las llaman, de ricos y reales palacios.
— Todo pudo ser —respondió Sancho—, pero a mí bardas me parecieron, si no es
que soy falto de memoria.
— Con todo eso, vamos allá, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—, que como yo la
vea, eso se me da que sea por bardas que por ventanas, o por resquicios, o
verjas de jardines; que cualquier rayo que del sol de su belleza llegue a
mis ojos alumbrará mi entendimiento y fortalecerá mi corazón, de modo que
quede único y sin igual en la discreción y en la valentía.
— Pues en verdad, señor —respondió Sancho—, que cuando yo vi ese sol de la
señora Dulcinea del Toboso, que no estaba tan claro, que pudiese echar de
sí rayos algunos, y debió de ser que, como su merced estaba ahechando aquel
trigo que dije, el mucho polvo que sacaba se le puso como nube ante el
rostro y se le escureció.
— ¡Que todavía das, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, en decir, en pensar, en creer
y en porfiar que mi señora Dulcinea ahechaba trigo, siendo eso un menester
y ejercicio que va desviado de todo lo que hacen y deben hacer las personas
principales que están constituidas y guardadas para otros ejercicios y
entretenimientos, que muestran a tiro de ballesta su principalidad...! Mal
se te acuerdan a ti, ¡oh Sancho!, aquellos versos de nuestro poeta donde
nos pinta las labores que hacían allá en sus moradas de cristal aquellas
cuatro ninfas que del Tajo amado sacaron las cabezas, y se sentaron a
labrar en el prado verde aquellas ricas telas que allí el ingenioso poeta
nos describe, que todas eran de oro, sirgo y perlas contestas y tejidas. Y
desta manera debía de ser el de mi señora cuando tú la viste; sino que la
envidia que algún mal encantador debe de tener a mis cosas, todas las que
me han de dar gusto trueca y vuelve en diferentes figuras que ellas tienen;
y así, temo que, en aquella historia que dicen que anda impresa de mis
hazañas, si por ventura ha sido su autor algún sabio mi enemigo, habrá
puesto unas cosas por otras, mezclando con una verdad mil mentiras,
divertiéndose a contar otras acciones fuera de lo que requiere la
continuación de una verdadera historia. ¡Oh envidia, raíz de infinitos
males y carcoma de las virtudes! Todos los vicios, Sancho, traen un no sé
qué de deleite consigo, pero el de la envidia no trae sino disgustos,
rancores y rabias.
— Eso es lo que yo digo también —respondió Sancho—, y pienso que en esa
leyenda o historia que nos dijo el bachiller Carrasco que de nosotros había
visto debe de andar mi honra a coche acá, cinchado, y, como dicen, al
estricote, aquí y allí, barriendo las calles. Pues, a fe de bueno, que no
he dicho yo mal de ningún encantador, ni tengo tantos bienes que pueda ser
envidiado; bien es verdad que soy algo malicioso, y que tengo mis ciertos
asomos de bellaco, pero todo lo cubre y tapa la gran capa de la simpleza
mía, siempre natural y nunca artificiosa. Y cuando otra cosa no tuviese
sino el creer, como siempre creo, firme y verdaderamente en Dios y en todo
aquello que tiene y cree la Santa Iglesia Católica Romana, y el ser enemigo
mortal, como lo soy, de los judíos, debían los historiadores tener
misericordia de mí y tratarme bien en sus escritos. Pero digan lo que
quisieren; que desnudo nací, desnudo me hallo: ni pierdo ni gano; aunque,
por verme puesto en libros y andar por ese mundo de mano en mano, no se me
da un higo que digan de mí todo lo que quisieren.
— Eso me parece, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, a lo que sucedió a un famoso
poeta destos tiempos, el cual, habiendo hecho una maliciosa sátira contra
todas las damas cortesanas, no puso ni nombró en ella a una dama que se
podía dudar si lo era o no; la cual, viendo que no estaba en la lista de
las demás, se quejó al poeta, diciéndole que qué había visto en ella para
no ponerla en el número de las otras, y que alargase la sátira, y la
pusiese en el ensanche; si no, que mirase para lo que había nacido. Hízolo
así el poeta, y púsola cual no digan dueñas, y ella quedó satisfecha, por
verse con fama, aunque infame. También viene con esto lo que cuentan de
aquel pastor que puso fuego y abrasó el templo famoso de Diana, contado por
una de las siete maravillas del mundo, sólo porque quedase vivo su nombre
en los siglos venideros; y, aunque se mandó que nadie le nombrase, ni
hiciese por palabra o por escrito mención de su nombre, porque no
consiguiese el fin de su deseo, todavía se supo que se llamaba Eróstrato.
También alude a esto lo que sucedió al grande emperador Carlo Quinto con un
caballero en Roma. Quiso ver el emperador aquel famoso templo de la
Rotunda, que en la antigüedad se llamó el templo de todos los dioses, y
ahora, con mejor vocación, se llama de todos los santos, y es el edificio
que más entero ha quedado de los que alzó la gentilidad en Roma, y es el
que más conserva la fama de la grandiosidad y magnificencia de sus
fundadores: él es de hechura de una media naranja, grandísimo en estremo,
y está muy claro, sin entrarle otra luz que la que le concede una ventana,
o, por mejor decir, claraboya redonda que está en su cima, desde la cual
mirando el emperador el edificio, estaba con él y a su lado un caballero
romano, declarándole los primores y sutilezas de aquella gran máquina y
memorable arquitetura; y, habiéndose quitado de la claraboya, dijo al
emperador: ''Mil veces, Sacra Majestad, me vino deseo de abrazarme con
vuestra Majestad y arrojarme de aquella claraboya abajo, por dejar de mí
fama eterna en el mundo''. ''Yo os agradezco —respondió el emperador— el no
haber puesto tan mal pensamiento en efeto, y de aquí adelante no os pondré
yo en ocasión que volváis a hacer prueba de vuestra lealtad; y así, os
mando que jamás me habléis, ni estéis donde yo estuviere''. Y, tras estas
palabras, le hizo una gran merced. Quiero decir, Sancho, que el deseo de
alcanzar fama es activo en gran manera. ¿Quién piensas tú que arrojó a
Horacio del puente abajo, armado de todas armas, en la profundidad del
Tibre? ¿Quién abrasó el brazo y la mano a Mucio? ¿Quién impelió a Curcio a
lanzarse en la profunda sima ardiente que apareció en la mitad de Roma?
¿Quién, contra todos los agüeros que en contra se le habían mostrado, hizo
pasar el Rubicón a César? Y, con ejemplos más modernos, ¿quién barrenó los
navíos y dejó en seco y aislados los valerosos españoles guiados por el
cortesísimo Cortés en el Nuevo Mundo? Todas estas y otras grandes y
diferentes hazañas son, fueron y serán obras de la fama, que los mortales
desean como premios y parte de la inmortalidad que sus famosos hechos
merecen, puesto que los cristianos, católicos y andantes caballeros más
habemos de atender a la gloria de los siglos venideros, que es eterna en
las regiones etéreas y celestes, que a la vanidad de la fama que en este
presente y acabable siglo se alcanza; la cual fama, por mucho que dure, en
fin se ha de acabar con el mesmo mundo, que tiene su fin señalado. Así, ¡oh
Sancho!, que nuestras obras no han de salir del límite que nos tiene puesto
la religión cristiana, que profesamos. Hemos de matar en los gigantes a la
soberbia; a la envidia, en la generosidad y buen pecho; a la ira, en el
reposado continente y quietud del ánimo; a la gula y al sueño, en el poco
comer que comemos y en el mucho velar que velamos; a la lujuria y lascivia,
en la lealtad que guardamos a las que hemos hecho señoras de nuestros
pensamientos; a la pereza, con andar por todas las partes del mundo,
buscando las ocasiones que nos puedan hacer y hagan, sobre cristianos,
famosos caballeros. Ves aquí, Sancho, los medios por donde se alcanzan los
estremos de alabanzas que consigo trae la buena fama.
— Todo lo que vuestra merced hasta aquí me ha dicho —dijo Sancho— lo he
entendido muy bien, pero, con todo eso, querría que vuestra merced me
sorbiese una duda que agora en este punto me ha venido a la memoria.
— Asolviese quieres decir, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—. Di en buen hora, que
yo responderé lo que supiere.
— Dígame, señor —prosiguió Sancho—: esos Julios o Agostos, y todos esos
caballeros hazañosos que ha dicho, que ya son muertos, ¿dónde están agora?
— Los gentiles —respondió don Quijote— sin duda están en el infierno; los
cristianos, si fueron buenos cristianos, o están en el purgatorio o en el
cielo.
— Está bien —dijo Sancho—, pero sepamos ahora: esas sepulturas donde están
los cuerpos desos señorazos, ¿tienen delante de sí lámparas de plata, o
están adornadas las paredes de sus capillas de muletas, de mortajas, de
cabelleras, de piernas y de ojos de cera? Y si desto no, ¿de qué están
adornadas?
A lo que respondió don Quijote:
— Los sepulcros de los gentiles fueron por la mayor parte suntuosos templos:
las cenizas del cuerpo de Julio César se pusieron sobre una pirámide de
piedra de desmesurada grandeza, a quien hoy llaman en Roma La aguja de San
Pedro; al emperador Adriano le sirvió de sepultura un castillo tan grande
como una buena aldea, a quien llamaron Moles Hadriani, que agora es el
castillo de Santángel en Roma; la reina Artemisa sepultó a su marido
Mausoleo en un sepulcro que se tuvo por una de las siete maravillas del
mundo; pero ninguna destas sepulturas ni otras muchas que tuvieron los
gentiles se adornaron con mortajas ni con otras ofrendas y señales que
mostrasen ser santos los que en ellas estaban sepultados.
— A eso voy —replicó Sancho—. Y dígame agora: ¿cuál es más: resucitar a un
muerto, o matar a un gigante?
— La respuesta está en la mano —respondió don Quijote—: más es resucitar a
un muerto.
— Cogido le tengo —dijo Sancho—: luego la fama del que resucita muertos, da
vista a los ciegos, endereza los cojos y da salud a los enfermos, y delante
de sus sepulturas arden lámparas, y están llenas sus capillas de gentes
devotas que de rodillas adoran sus reliquias, mejor fama será, para este y
para el otro siglo, que la que dejaron y dejaren cuantos emperadores
gentiles y caballeros andantes ha habido en el mundo.
— También confieso esa verdad —respondió don Quijote.
— Pues esta fama, estas gracias, estas prerrogativas, como llaman a esto
— respondió Sancho—, tienen los cuerpos y las reliquias de los santos que,
con aprobación y licencia de nuestra santa madre Iglesia, tienen lámparas,
velas, mortajas, muletas, pinturas, cabelleras, ojos, piernas, con que
aumentan la devoción y engrandecen su cristiana fama. Los cuerpos de los
santos o sus reliquias llevan los reyes sobre sus hombros, besan los
pedazos de sus huesos, adornan y enriquecen con ellos sus oratorios y sus
más preciados altares...
— ¿Qué quieres que infiera, Sancho, de todo lo que has dicho? —dijo don
Quijote.
— Quiero decir —dijo Sancho— que nos demos a ser santos, y alcanzaremos más
brevemente la buena fama que pretendemos; y advierta, señor, que ayer o
antes de ayer, que, según ha poco se puede decir desta manera, canonizaron
o beatificaron dos frailecitos descalzos, cuyas cadenas de hierro con que
ceñían y atormentaban sus cuerpos se tiene ahora a gran ventura el besarlas
y tocarlas, y están en más veneración que está, según dije, la espada de
Roldán en la armería del rey, nuestro señor, que Dios guarde. Así que,
señor mío, más vale ser humilde frailecito, de cualquier orden que sea,
que valiente y andante caballero; mas alcanzan con Dios dos docenas de
diciplinas que dos mil lanzadas, ora las den a gigantes, ora a vestiglos o
a endrigos.
— Todo eso es así —respondió don Quijote—, pero no todos podemos ser
frailes, y muchos son los caminos por donde lleva Dios a los suyos al
cielo: religión es la caballería; caballeros santos hay en la gloria.
— Sí —respondió Sancho—, pero yo he oído decir que hay más frailes en el
cielo que caballeros andantes.
— Eso es —respondió don Quijote— porque es mayor el número de los religiosos
que el de los caballeros.
— Muchos son los andantes —dijo Sancho.
— Muchos —respondió don Quijote—, pero pocos los que merecen nombre de
caballeros.
En estas y otras semejantes pláticas se les pasó aquella noche y el día
siguiente, sin acontecerles cosa que de contar fuese, de que no poco le
pesó a don Quijote. En fin, otro día, al anochecer, descubrieron la gran
ciudad del Toboso, con cuya vista se le alegraron los espíritus a don
Quijote y se le entristecieron a Sancho, porque no sabía la casa de
Dulcinea, ni en su vida la había visto, como no la había visto su señor; de
modo que el uno por verla, y el otro por no haberla visto, estaban
alborotados, y no imaginaba Sancho qué había de hacer cuando su dueño le
enviase al Toboso. Finalmente, ordenó don Quijote entrar en la ciudad
entrada la noche, y, en tanto que la hora se llegaba, se quedaron entre
unas encinas que cerca del Toboso estaban, y, llegado el determinado punto,
entraron en la ciudad, donde les sucedió cosas que a cosas llegan.
Capítulo IX. Donde se cuenta lo que en él se verá
Media noche era por filo, poco más a menos, cuando don Quijote y Sancho
dejaron el monte y entraron en el Toboso. Estaba el pueblo en un sosegado
silencio, porque todos sus vecinos dormían y reposaban a pierna tendida,
como suele decirse. Era la noche entreclara, puesto que quisiera Sancho que
fuera del todo escura, por hallar en su escuridad disculpa de su sandez. No
se oía en todo el lugar sino ladridos de perros, que atronaban los oídos de
don Quijote y turbaban el corazón de Sancho. De cuando en cuando, rebuznaba
un jumento, gruñían puercos, mayaban gatos, cuyas voces, de diferentes
sonidos, se aumentaban con el silencio de la noche, todo lo cual tuvo el
enamorado caballero a mal agüero; pero, con todo esto, dijo a Sancho:
— Sancho, hijo, guía al palacio de Dulcinea: quizá podrá ser que la hallemos
despierta.
— ¿A qué palacio tengo de guiar, cuerpo del sol —respondió Sancho—, que en
el que yo vi a su grandeza no era sino casa muy pequeña?
— Debía de estar retirada, entonces —respondió don Quijote—, en algún
pequeño apartamiento de su alcázar, solazándose a solas con sus doncellas,
como es uso y costumbre de las altas señoras y princesas.
— Señor —dijo Sancho—, ya que vuestra merced quiere, a pesar mío, que sea
alcázar la casa de mi señora Dulcinea, ¿es hora ésta por ventura de hallar
la puerta abierta? Y ¿será bien que demos aldabazos para que nos oyan y nos
abran, metiendo en alboroto y rumor toda la gente? ¿Vamos por dicha a
llamar a la casa de nuestras mancebas, como hacen los abarraganados, que
llegan, y llaman, y entran a cualquier hora, por tarde que sea?
— Hallemos primero una por una el alcázar —replicó don Quijote—, que
entonces yo te diré, Sancho, lo que será bien que hagamos. Y advierte,
Sancho, que yo veo poco, o que aquel bulto grande y sombra que desde aquí
se descubre la debe de hacer el palacio de Dulcinea.
— Pues guíe vuestra merced —respondió Sancho—: quizá será así; aunque yo lo
veré con los ojos y lo tocaré con las manos, y así lo creeré yo como creer
que es ahora de día.
Guió don Quijote, y, habiendo andado como docientos pasos, dio con el bulto
que hacía la sombra, y vio una gran torre, y luego conoció que el tal
edificio no era alcázar, sino la iglesia principal del pueblo. Y dijo:
— Con la iglesia hemos dado, Sancho.
— Ya lo veo —respondió Sancho—; y plega a Dios que no demos con nuestra
sepultura, que no es buena señal andar por los cimenterios a tales horas, y
más, habiendo yo dicho a vuestra merced, si mal no me acuerdo, que la
casa desta señora ha de estar en una callejuela sin salida.
— ¡Maldito seas de Dios, mentecato! —dijo don Quijote—. ¿Adónde has tú
hallado que los alcázares y palacios reales estén edificados en callejuelas
sin salida?
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, en cada tierra su uso: quizá se usa aquí en el
Toboso edificar en callejuelas los palacios y edificios grandes; y así,
suplico a vuestra merced me deje buscar por estas calles o callejuelas que
se me ofrecen: podría ser que en algún rincón topase con ese alcázar, que
le vea yo comido de perros, que así nos trae corridos y asendereados.
— Habla con respeto, Sancho, de las cosas de mi señora —dijo don Quijote—, y
tengamos la fiesta en paz, y no arrojemos la soga tras el caldero.
— Yo me reportaré —respondió Sancho—; pero, ¿con qué paciencia podré llevar
que quiera vuestra merced que de sola una vez que vi la casa de nuestra
ama, la haya de saber siempre y hallarla a media noche, no hallándola
vuestra merced, que la debe de haber visto millares de veces?
— Tú me harás desesperar, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—. Ven acá, hereje: ¿no te
he dicho mil veces que en todos los días de mi vida no he visto a la sin
par Dulcinea, ni jamás atravesé los umbrales de su palacio, y que sólo
estoy enamorado de oídas y de la gran fama que tiene de hermosa y discreta?
— Ahora lo oigo —respondió Sancho—; y digo que, pues vuestra merced no la ha
visto, ni yo tampoco...
— Eso no puede ser —replicó don Quijote—; que, por lo menos, ya me has dicho
tú que la viste ahechando trigo, cuando me trujiste la respuesta de la
carta que le envié contigo.
— No se atenga a eso, señor —respondió Sancho—, porque le hago saber que
también fue de oídas la vista y la respuesta que le truje; porque, así sé
yo quién es la señora Dulcinea como dar un puño en el cielo.
— Sancho, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, tiempos hay de burlar, y tiempos
donde caen y parecen mal las burlas. No porque yo diga que ni he visto ni
hablado a la señora de mi alma has tú de decir también que ni la has
hablado ni visto, siendo tan al revés como sabes.
Estando los dos en estas pláticas, vieron que venía a pasar por donde
estaban uno con dos mulas, que, por el ruido que hacía el arado, que
arrastraba por el suelo, juzgaron que debía de ser labrador, que habría
madrugado antes del día a ir a su labranza; y así fue la verdad. Venía el
labrador cantando aquel romance que dicen:
Mala la hubistes, franceses,
en esa de Roncesvalles.
— Que me maten, Sancho —dijo, en oyéndole, don Quijote—, si nos ha de
suceder cosa buena esta noche. ¿No oyes lo que viene cantando ese villano?
— Sí oigo —respondió Sancho—; pero, ¿qué hace a nuestro propósito la caza de
Roncesvalles? Así pudiera cantar el romance de Calaínos, que todo fuera uno
para sucedernos bien o mal en nuestro negocio.
Llegó, en esto, el labrador, a quien don Quijote preguntó:
— ¿Sabréisme decir, buen amigo, que buena ventura os dé Dios, dónde son por
aquí los palacios de la sin par princesa doña Dulcinea del Toboso?
— Señor —respondió el mozo—, yo soy forastero y ha pocos días que estoy en
este pueblo, sirviendo a un labrador rico en la labranza del campo; en esa
casa frontera viven el cura y el sacristán del lugar; entrambos, o
cualquier dellos, sabrá dar a vuestra merced razón desa señora princesa,
porque tienen la lista de todos los vecinos del Toboso; aunque para mí
tengo que en todo él no vive princesa alguna; muchas señoras, sí,
principales, que cada una en su casa puede ser princesa.
— Pues entre ésas —dijo don Quijote— debe de estar, amigo, ésta por quien te
pregunto.
— Podría ser —respondió el mozo—; y adiós, que ya viene el alba.
Y, dando a sus mulas, no atendió a más preguntas. Sancho, que vio suspenso
a su señor y asaz mal contento, le dijo:
— Señor, ya se viene a más andar el día, y no será acertado dejar que nos
halle el sol en la calle; mejor será que nos salgamos fuera de la ciudad, y
que vuestra merced se embosque en alguna floresta aquí cercana, y yo
volveré de día, y no dejaré ostugo en todo este lugar donde no busque la
casa, alcázar o palacio de mi señora, y asaz sería de desdichado si no le
hallase; y, hallándole, hablaré con su merced, y le diré dónde y cómo queda
vuestra merced esperando que le dé orden y traza para verla, sin menoscabo
de su honra y fama.
— Has dicho, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, mil sentencias encerradas en el
círculo de breves palabras: el consejo que ahora me has dado le apetezco y
recibo de bonísima gana. Ven, hijo, y vamos a buscar donde me embosque, que
tú volverás, como dices, a buscar, a ver y hablar a mi señora, de cuya
discreción y cortesía espero más que milagrosos favores.
Rabiaba Sancho por sacar a su amo del pueblo, porque no averiguase la
mentira de la respuesta que de parte de Dulcinea le había llevado a Sierra
Morena; y así, dio priesa a la salida, que fue luego, y a dos millas del
lugar hallaron una floresta o bosque, donde don Quijote se emboscó en tanto
que Sancho volvía a la ciudad a hablar a Dulcinea; en cuya embajada le
sucedieron cosas que piden nueva atención y nuevo crédito.
Capítulo X. Donde se cuenta la industria que Sancho tuvo para encantar a la
señora Dulcinea, y de otros sucesos tan ridículos como verdaderos
Llegando el autor desta grande historia a contar lo que en este capítulo
cuenta, dice que quisiera pasarle en silencio, temeroso de que no había de
ser creído, porque las locuras de don Quijote llegaron aquí al término y
raya de las mayores que pueden imaginarse, y aun pasaron dos tiros de
ballesta más allá de las mayores. Finalmente, aunque con este miedo y
recelo, las escribió de la misma manera que él las hizo, sin añadir ni
quitar a la historia un átomo de la verdad, sin dársele nada por las
objeciones que podían ponerle de mentiroso. Y tuvo razón, porque la verdad
adelgaza y no quiebra, y siempre anda sobre la mentira como el aceite sobre
el agua.
Y así, prosiguiendo su historia, dice que, así como don Quijote se emboscó
en la floresta, encinar o selva junto al gran Toboso, mandó a Sancho volver
a la ciudad, y que no volviese a su presencia sin haber primero hablado de
su parte a su señora, pidiéndola fuese servida de dejarse ver de su cautivo
caballero, y se dignase de echarle su bendición, para que pudiese esperar
por ella felicísimos sucesos de todos sus acometimientos y dificultosas
empresas. Encargóse Sancho de hacerlo así como se le mandaba, y de traerle
tan buena respuesta como le trujo la vez primera.
— Anda, hijo —replicó don Quijote—, y no te turbes cuando te vieres ante la
luz del sol de hermosura que vas a buscar. ¡Dichoso tú sobre todos los
escuderos del mundo! Ten memoria, y no se te pase della cómo te recibe: si
muda las colores el tiempo que la estuvieres dando mi embajada; si se
desasosiega y turba oyendo mi nombre; si no cabe en la almohada, si acaso
la hallas sentada en el estrado rico de su autoridad; y si está en pie,
mírala si se pone ahora sobre el uno, ahora sobre el otro pie; si te repite
la respuesta que te diere dos o tres veces; si la muda de blanda en áspera,
de aceda en amorosa; si levanta la mano al cabello para componerle, aunque
no esté desordenado; finalmente, hijo, mira todas sus acciones y
movimientos; porque si tú me los relatares como ellos fueron, sacaré yo lo
que ella tiene escondido en lo secreto de su corazón acerca de lo que al
fecho de mis amores toca; que has de saber, Sancho, si no lo sabes, que
entre los amantes, las acciones y movimientos exteriores que muestran,
cuando de sus amores se trata, son certísimos correos que traen las nuevas
de lo que allá en lo interior del alma pasa. Ve, amigo, y guíete otra mejor
ventura que la mía, y vuélvate otro mejor suceso del que yo quedo temiendo
y esperando en esta amarga soledad en que me dejas.
— Yo iré y volveré presto —dijo Sancho—; y ensanche vuestra merced, señor
mío, ese corazoncillo, que le debe de tener agora no mayor que una
avellana, y considere que se suele decir que buen corazón quebranta mala
ventura, y que donde no hay tocinos, no hay estacas; y también se dice:
donde no piensa, salta la liebre. Dígolo porque si esta noche no hallamos
los palacios o alcázares de mi señora, agora que es de día los pienso
hallar, cuando menos los piense, y hallados, déjenme a mí con ella.
— Por cierto, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que siempre traes tus refranes tan
a pelo de lo que tratamos cuanto me dé Dios mejor ventura en lo que deseo.
Esto dicho, volvió Sancho las espaldas y vareó su rucio, y don Quijote se
quedó a caballo, descansando sobre los estribos y sobre el arrimo de su
lanza, lleno de tristes y confusas imaginaciones, donde le dejaremos,
yéndonos con Sancho Panza, que no menos confuso y pensativo se apartó de su
señor que él quedaba; y tanto, que, apenas hubo salido del bosque, cuando,
volviendo la cabeza y viendo que don Quijote no parecía, se apeó del
jumento, y, sentándose al pie de un árbol, comenzó a hablar consigo mesmo y
a decirse:
— Sepamos agora, Sancho hermano, adónde va vuesa merced. ¿Va a buscar algún
jumento que se le haya perdido? ''No, por cierto''. Pues, ¿qué va a buscar?
''Voy a buscar, como quien no dice nada, a una princesa, y en ella al sol
de la hermosura y a todo el cielo junto''. Y ¿adónde pensáis hallar eso que
decís, Sancho? ''¿Adónde? En la gran ciudad del Toboso''. Y bien: ¿y de
parte de quién la vais a buscar? ''De parte del famoso caballero don
Quijote de la Mancha, que desface los tuertos, y da de comer al que ha sed,
y de beber al que ha hambre''. Todo eso está muy bien. Y ¿sabéis su casa,
Sancho? ''Mi amo dice que han de ser unos reales palacios o unos soberbios
alcázares''. Y ¿habéisla visto algún día por ventura? ''Ni yo ni mi amo la
habemos visto jamás''. Y ¿paréceos que fuera acertado y bien hecho que si
los del Toboso supiesen que estáis vos aquí con intención de ir a
sonsacarles sus princesas y a desasosegarles sus damas, viniesen y os
moliesen las costillas a puros palos, y no os dejasen hueso sano? ''En
verdad que tendrían mucha razón, cuando no considerasen que soy mandado, y
que mensajero sois, amigo, no merecéis culpa, non''. No os fiéis en eso,
Sancho, porque la gente manchega es tan colérica como honrada, y no
consiente cosquillas de nadie. Vive Dios que si os huele, que os mando mala
ventura. ''¡Oxte, puto! ¡Allá darás, rayo! ¡No, sino ándeme yo buscando
tres pies al gato por el gusto ajeno! Y más, que así será buscar a Dulcinea
por el Toboso como a Marica por Rávena, o al bachiller en Salamanca. ¡El
diablo, el diablo me ha metido a mí en esto, que otro no!''
Este soliloquio pasó consigo Sancho, y lo que sacó dél fue que volvió a
decirse:
— Ahora bien, todas las cosas tienen remedio, si no es la muerte, debajo de
cuyo yugo hemos de pasar todos, mal que nos pese, al acabar de la vida.
Este mi amo, por mil señales, he visto que es un loco de atar, y aun
también yo no le quedo en zaga, pues soy más mentecato que él, pues le sigo
y le sirvo, si es verdadero el refrán que dice: "Dime con quién andas,
decirte he quién eres", y el otro de "No con quien naces, sino con quien
paces". Siendo, pues, loco, como lo es, y de locura que las más veces toma
unas cosas por otras, y juzga lo blanco por negro y lo negro por blanco,
como se pareció cuando dijo que los molinos de viento eran gigantes, y las
mulas de los religiosos dromedarios, y las manadas de carneros ejércitos de
enemigos, y otras muchas cosas a este tono, no será muy difícil hacerle
creer que una labradora, la primera que me topare por aquí, es la señora
Dulcinea; y, cuando él no lo crea, juraré yo; y si él jurare, tornaré yo a
jurar; y si porfiare, porfiaré yo más, y de manera que tengo de tener la
mía siempre sobre el hito, venga lo que viniere. Quizá con esta porfía
acabaré con él que no me envíe otra vez a semejantes mensajerías, viendo
cuán mal recado le traigo dellas, o quizá pensará, como yo imagino, que
algún mal encantador de estos que él dice que le quieren mal la habrá
mudado la figura por hacerle mal y daño.
Con esto que pensó Sancho Panza quedó sosegado su espíritu, y tuvo por bien
acabado su negocio, y deteniéndose allí hasta la tarde, por dar lugar a que
don Quijote pensase que le había tenido para ir y volver del Toboso; y
sucedióle todo tan bien que, cuando se levantó para subir en el rucio, vio
que del Toboso hacia donde él estaba venían tres labradoras sobre tres
pollinos, o pollinas, que el autor no lo declara, aunque más se puede creer
que eran borricas, por ser ordinaria caballería de las aldeanas; pero, como
no va mucho en esto, no hay para qué detenernos en averiguarlo. En
resolución: así como Sancho vio a las labradoras, a paso tirado volvió a
buscar a su señor don Quijote, y hallóle suspirando y diciendo mil amorosas
lamentaciones. Como don Quijote le vio, le dijo:
— ¿Qué hay, Sancho amigo? ¿Podré señalar este día con piedra blanca, o con
negra?
— Mejor será —respondió Sancho— que vuesa merced le señale con almagre, como
rétulos de cátedras, porque le echen bien de ver los que le vieren.
— De ese modo —replicó don Quijote—, buenas nuevas traes.
— Tan buenas —respondió Sancho—, que no tiene más que hacer vuesa merced
sino picar a Rocinante y salir a lo raso a ver a la señora Dulcinea del
Toboso, que con otras dos doncellas suyas viene a ver a vuesa merced.
— ¡Santo Dios! ¿Qué es lo que dices, Sancho amigo? —dijo don Quijote—. Mira
no me engañes, ni quieras con falsas alegrías alegrar mis verdaderas
tristezas.
— ¿Qué sacaría yo de engañar a vuesa merced —respondió Sancho—, y más
estando tan cerca de descubrir mi verdad? Pique, señor, y venga, y verá
venir a la princesa, nuestra ama, vestida y adornada, en fin, como quien
ella es. Sus doncellas y ella todas son una ascua de oro, todas mazorcas de
perlas, todas son diamantes, todas rubíes, todas telas de brocado de más de
diez altos; los cabellos, sueltos por las espaldas, que son otros tantos
rayos del sol que andan jugando con el viento; y, sobre todo, vienen a
caballo sobre tres cananeas remendadas, que no hay más que ver.
— Hacaneas querrás decir, Sancho.
— Poca diferencia hay —respondió Sancho— de cananeas a hacaneas; pero,
vengan sobre lo que vinieren, ellas vienen las más galanas señoras que se
puedan desear, especialmente la princesa Dulcinea, mi señora, que pasma los
sentidos.
— Vamos, Sancho hijo —respondió don Quijote—; y, en albricias destas no
esperadas como buenas nuevas, te mando el mejor despojo que ganare en la
primera aventura que tuviere, y si esto no te contenta, te mando las crías
que este año me dieren las tres yeguas mías, que tú sabes que quedan para
parir en el prado concejil de nuestro pueblo.
— A las crías me atengo —respondió Sancho—, porque de ser buenos los
despojos de la primera aventura no está muy cierto.
Ya en esto salieron de la selva, y descubrieron cerca a las tres aldeanas.
Tendió don Quijote los ojos por todo el camino del Toboso, y como no vio
sino a las tres labradoras, turbóse todo, y preguntó a Sancho si las había
dejado fuera de la ciudad.
— ¿Cómo fuera de la ciudad? —respondió—. ¿Por ventura tiene vuesa merced los
ojos en el colodrillo, que no vee que son éstas, las que aquí vienen,
resplandecientes como el mismo sol a mediodía?
— Yo no veo, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, sino a tres labradoras sobre tres
borricos.
— ¡Agora me libre Dios del diablo! —respondió Sancho—. Y ¿es posible que
tres hacaneas, o como se llaman, blancas como el ampo de la nieve, le
parezcan a vuesa merced borricos? ¡Vive el Señor, que me pele estas barbas
si tal fuese verdad!
— Pues yo te digo, Sancho amigo —dijo don Quijote—, que es tan verdad que
son borricos, o borricas, como yo soy don Quijote y tú Sancho Panza; a lo
menos, a mí tales me parecen.
— Calle, señor —dijo Sancho—, no diga la tal palabra, sino despabile esos
ojos, y venga a hacer reverencia a la señora de sus pensamientos, que ya
llega cerca.
Y, diciendo esto, se adelantó a recebir a las tres aldeanas; y, apeándose
del rucio, tuvo del cabestro al jumento de una de las tres labradoras, y,
hincando ambas rodillas en el suelo, dijo:
— Reina y princesa y duquesa de la hermosura, vuestra altivez y grandeza sea
servida de recebir en su gracia y buen talente al cautivo caballero
vuestro, que allí está hecho piedra mármol, todo turbado y sin pulsos de
verse ante vuestra magnífica presencia. Yo soy Sancho Panza, su escudero, y
él es el asendereado caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, llamado por otro
nombre el Caballero de la Triste Figura.
A esta sazón, ya se había puesto don Quijote de hinojos junto a Sancho, y
miraba con ojos desencajados y vista turbada a la que Sancho llamaba reina
y señora, y, como no descubría en ella sino una moza aldeana, y no de muy
buen rostro, porque era carirredonda y chata, estaba suspenso y admirado,
sin osar desplegar los labios. Las labradoras estaban asimismo atónitas,
viendo aquellos dos hombres tan diferentes hincados de rodillas, que no
dejaban pasar adelante a su compañera; pero, rompiendo el silencio la
detenida, toda desgraciada y mohína, dijo:
— Apártense nora en tal del camino, y déjenmos pasar, que vamos de priesa.
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— ¡Oh princesa y señora universal del Toboso! ¿Cómo vuestro magnánimo
corazón no se enternece viendo arrodillado ante vuestra sublimada presencia
a la coluna y sustento de la andante caballería?
Oyendo lo cual, otra de las dos dijo:
— Mas, ¡jo, que te estrego, burra de mi suegro! ¡Mirad con qué se vienen los
señoritos ahora a hacer burla de las aldeanas, como si aquí no supiésemos
echar pullas como ellos! Vayan su camino, e déjenmos hacer el nueso, y
serles ha sano.
— Levántate, Sancho —dijo a este punto don Quijote—, que ya veo que la
Fortuna, de mi mal no harta, tiene tomados los caminos todos por donde
pueda venir algún contento a esta ánima mezquina que tengo en las carnes. Y
tú, ¡oh estremo del valor que puede desearse, término de la humana
gentileza, único remedio deste afligido corazón que te adora!, ya que el
maligno encantador me persigue, y ha puesto nubes y cataratas en mis ojos,
y para sólo ellos y no para otros ha mudado y transformado tu sin igual
hermosura y rostro en el de una labradora pobre, si ya también el mío no le
ha cambiado en el de algún vestiglo, para hacerle aborrecible a tus ojos,
no dejes de mirarme blanda y amorosamente, echando de ver en esta sumisión
y arrodillamiento que a tu contrahecha hermosura hago, la humildad con que
mi alma te adora.
— ¡Tomá que mi agüelo! —respondió la aldeana—. ¡Amiguita soy yo de oír
resquebrajos! Apártense y déjenmos ir, y agradecérselo hemos.
Apartóse Sancho y dejóla ir, contentísimo de haber salido bien de su
enredo.
Apenas se vio libre la aldeana que había hecho la figura de Dulcinea,
cuando, picando a su cananea con un aguijón que en un palo traía, dio a
correr por el prado adelante. Y, como la borrica sentía la punta del
aguijón, que le fatigaba más de lo ordinario, comenzó a dar corcovos, de
manera que dio con la señora Dulcinea en tierra; lo cual visto por don
Quijote, acudió a levantarla, y Sancho a componer y cinchar el albarda, que
también vino a la barriga de la pollina. Acomodada, pues, la albarda, y
quiriendo don Quijote levantar a su encantada señora en los brazos sobre la
jumenta, la señora, levantándose del suelo, le quitó de aquel trabajo,
porque, haciéndose algún tanto atrás, tomó una corridica, y, puestas ambas
manos sobre las ancas de la pollina, dio con su cuerpo, más ligero que un
halcón, sobre la albarda, y quedó a horcajadas, como si fuera hombre; y
entonces dijo Sancho:
— ¡Vive Roque, que es la señora nuestra ama más ligera que un acotán, y que
puede enseñar a subir a la jineta al más diestro cordobés o mejicano! El
arzón trasero de la silla pasó de un salto, y sin espuelas hace correr la
hacanea como una cebra. Y no le van en zaga sus doncellas; que todas corren
como el viento.
Y así era la verdad, porque, en viéndose a caballo Dulcinea, todas picaron
tras ella y dispararon a correr, sin volver la cabeza atrás por espacio de
más de media legua. Siguiólas don Quijote con la vista, y, cuando vio que
no parecían, volviéndose a Sancho, le dijo:
— Sancho, ¿qué te parece cuán malquisto soy de encantadores? Y mira hasta
dónde se estiende su malicia y la ojeriza que me tienen, pues me han
querido privar del contento que pudiera darme ver en su ser a mi señora. En
efecto, yo nací para ejemplo de desdichados, y para ser blanco y terrero
donde tomen la mira y asiesten las flechas de la mala fortuna. Y has
también de advertir, Sancho, que no se contentaron estos traidores de haber
vuelto y transformado a mi Dulcinea, sino que la transformaron y volvieron
en una figura tan baja y tan fea como la de aquella aldeana, y juntamente
le quitaron lo que es tan suyo de las principales señoras, que es el buen
olor, por andar siempre entre ámbares y entre flores. Porque te hago saber,
Sancho, que cuando llegé a subir a Dulcinea sobre su hacanea, según tú
dices, que a mí me pareció borrica, me dio un olor de ajos crudos, que me
encalabrinó y atosigó el alma.
— ¡Oh canalla! —gritó a esta sazón Sancho— ¡Oh encantadores aciagos y
malintencionados, y quién os viera a todos ensartados por las agallas, como
sardinas en lercha! Mucho sabéis, mucho podéis y mucho más hacéis. Bastaros
debiera, bellacos, haber mudado las perlas de los ojos de mi señora en
agallas alcornoqueñas, y sus cabellos de oro purísimo en cerdas de cola de
buey bermejo, y, finalmente, todas sus faciones de buenas en malas, sin que
le tocárades en el olor; que por él siquiera sacáramos lo que estaba
encubierto debajo de aquella fea corteza; aunque, para decir verdad, nunca
yo vi su fealdad, sino su hermosura, a la cual subía de punto y quilates un
lunar que tenía sobre el labio derecho, a manera de bigote, con siete o
ocho cabellos rubios como hebras de oro y largos de más de un palmo.
— A ese lunar —dijo don Quijote—, según la correspondencia que tienen entre
sí los del rostro con los del cuerpo, ha de tener otro Dulcinea en la tabla
del muslo que corresponde al lado donde tiene el del rostro, pero muy
luengos para lunares son pelos de la grandeza que has significado.
— Pues yo sé decir a vuestra merced —respondió Sancho— que le parecían allí
como nacidos.
— Yo lo creo, amigo —replicó don Quijote—, porque ninguna cosa puso la
naturaleza en Dulcinea que no fuese perfecta y bien acabada; y así, si
tuviera cien lunares como el que dices, en ella no fueran lunares, sino
lunas y estrellas resplandecientes. Pero dime, Sancho: aquella que a mí me
pareció albarda, que tú aderezaste, ¿era silla rasa o sillón?
— No era —respondió Sancho— sino silla a la jineta, con una cubierta de
campo que vale la mitad de un reino, según es de rica.
— ¡Y que no viese yo todo eso, Sancho! —dijo don Quijote—. Ahora torno a
decir, y diré mil veces, que soy el más desdichado de los hombres.
Harto tenía que hacer el socarrón de Sancho en disimular la risa, oyendo
las sandeces de su amo, tan delicadamente engañado. Finalmente, después de
otras muchas razones que entre los dos pasaron, volvieron a subir en sus
bestias, y siguieron el camino de Zaragoza, adonde pensaban llegar a tiempo
que pudiesen hallarse en unas solenes fiestas que en aquella insigne ciudad
cada año suelen hacerse. Pero, antes que allá llegasen, les sucedieron
cosas que, por muchas, grandes y nuevas, merecen ser escritas y leídas,
como se verá adelante.
Capítulo XI. De la estraña aventura que le sucedió al valeroso don Quijote
con el carro, o carreta, de Las Cortes de la Muerte
Pensativo además iba don Quijote por su camino adelante, considerando la
mala burla que le habían hecho los encantadores, volviendo a su señora
Dulcinea en la mala figura de la aldeana, y no imaginaba qué remedio
tendría para volverla a su ser primero; y estos pensamientos le llevaban
tan fuera de sí, que, sin sentirlo, soltó las riendas a Rocinante, el cual,
sintiendo la libertad que se le daba, a cada paso se detenía a pacer la
verde yerba de que aquellos campos abundaban. De su embelesamiento le
volvió Sancho Panza, diciéndole:
— Señor, las tristezas no se hicieron para las bestias, sino para los
hombres; pero si los hombres las sienten demasiado, se vuelven bestias:
vuestra merced se reporte, y vuelva en sí, y coja las riendas a Rocinante,
y avive y despierte, y muestre aquella gallardía que conviene que tengan
los caballeros andantes. ¿Qué diablos es esto? ¿Qué descaecimiento es éste?
¿Estamos aquí, o en Francia? Mas que se lleve Satanás a cuantas Dulcineas
hay en el mundo, pues vale más la salud de un solo caballero andante que
todos los encantos y transformaciones de la tierra.
— Calla, Sancho —respondió don Quijote con voz no muy desmayada—; calla,
digo, y no digas blasfemias contra aquella encantada señora, que de su
desgracia y desventura yo solo tengo la culpa: de la invidia que me tienen
los malos ha nacido su mala andanza.
— Así lo digo yo —respondió Sancho—: quien la vido y la vee ahora, ¿cuál es
el corazón que no llora?
— Eso puedes tú decir bien, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—, pues la viste en
la entereza cabal de su hermosura, que el encanto no se estendió a turbarte
la vista ni a encubrirte su belleza: contra mí solo y contra mis ojos se
endereza la fuerza de su veneno. Mas, con todo esto, he caído, Sancho, en
una cosa, y es que me pintaste mal su hermosura, porque, si mal no me
acuerdo, dijiste que tenía los ojos de perlas, y los ojos que parecen de
perlas antes son de besugo que de dama; y, a lo que yo creo, los de
Dulcinea deben ser de verdes esmeraldas, rasgados, con dos celestiales
arcos que les sirven de cejas; y esas perlas quítalas de los ojos y pásalas
a los dientes, que sin duda te trocaste, Sancho, tomando los ojos por los
dientes.
— Todo puede ser —respondió Sancho—, porque también me turbó a mí su
hermosura como a vuesa merced su fealdad. Pero encomendémoslo todo a Dios,
que Él es el sabidor de las cosas que han de suceder en este valle de
lágrimas, en este mal mundo que tenemos, donde apenas se halla cosa que
esté sin mezcla de maldad, embuste y bellaquería. De una cosa me pesa,
señor mío, más que de otras; que es pensar qué medio se ha de tener cuando
vuesa merced venza a algún gigante o otro caballero, y le mande que se vaya
a presentar ante la hermosura de la señora Dulcinea: ¿adónde la ha de
hallar este pobre gigante, o este pobre y mísero caballero vencido?
Paréceme que los veo andar por el Toboso hechos unos bausanes, buscando a
mi señora Dulcinea, y, aunque la encuentren en mitad de la calle, no la
conocerán más que a mi padre.
— Quizá, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, no se estenderá el encantamento a
quitar el conocimiento de Dulcinea a los vencidos y presentados gigantes y
caballeros; y, en uno o dos de los primeros que yo venza y le envíe,
haremos la experiencia si la ven o no, mandándoles que vuelvan a darme
relación de lo que acerca desto les hubiere sucedido.
— Digo, señor —replicó Sancho—, que me ha parecido bien lo que vuesa merced
ha dicho, y que con ese artificio vendremos en conocimiento de lo que
deseamos; y si es que ella a solo vuesa merced se encubre, la desgracia más
será de vuesa merced que suya; pero, como la señora Dulcinea tenga salud y
contento, nosotros por acá nos avendremos y lo pasaremos lo mejor que
pudiéremos, buscando nuestras aventuras y dejando al tiempo que haga de las
suyas, que él es el mejor médico destas y de otras mayores enfermedades.
Responder quería don Quijote a Sancho Panza, pero estorbóselo una carreta
que salió al través del camino, cargada de los más diversos y estraños
personajes y figuras que pudieron imaginarse. El que guiaba las mulas y
servía de carretero era un feo demonio. Venía la carreta descubierta al
cielo abierto, sin toldo ni zarzo. La primera figura que se ofreció a los
ojos de don Quijote fue la de la misma Muerte, con rostro humano; junto a
ella venía un ángel con unas grandes y pintadas alas; al un lado estaba un
emperador con una corona, al parecer de oro, en la cabeza; a los pies de la
Muerte estaba el dios que llaman Cupido, sin venda en los ojos, pero con su
arco, carcaj y saetas. Venía también un caballero armado de punta en
blanco, excepto que no traía morrión, ni celada, sino un sombrero lleno de
plumas de diversas colores; con éstas venían otras personas de diferentes
trajes y rostros. Todo lo cual visto de improviso, en alguna manera
alborotó a don Quijote y puso miedo en el corazón de Sancho; mas luego se
alegró don Quijote, creyendo que se le ofrecía alguna nueva y peligrosa
aventura, y con este pensamiento, y con ánimo dispuesto de acometer
cualquier peligro, se puso delante de la carreta, y, con voz alta y
amenazadora, dijo:
— Carretero, cochero, o diablo, o lo que eres, no tardes en decirme quién
eres, a dó vas y quién es la gente que llevas en tu carricoche, que más
parece la barca de Carón que carreta de las que se usan.
A lo cual, mansamente, deteniendo el Diablo la carreta, respondió:
— Señor, nosotros somos recitantes de la compañía de Angulo el Malo; hemos
hecho en un lugar que está detrás de aquella loma, esta mañana, que es la
octava del Corpus, el auto de Las Cortes de la Muerte, y hémosle de hacer
esta tarde en aquel lugar que desde aquí se parece; y, por estar tan cerca
y escusar el trabajo de desnudarnos y volvernos a vestir, nos vamos
vestidos con los mesmos vestidos que representamos. Aquel mancebo va de
Muerte; el otro, de Ángel; aquella mujer, que es la del autor, va de Reina;
el otro, de Soldado; aquél, de Emperador, y yo, de Demonio, y soy una de
las principales figuras del auto, porque hago en esta compañía los primeros
papeles. Si otra cosa vuestra merced desea saber de nosotros, pregúntemelo,
que yo le sabré responder con toda puntualidad; que, como soy demonio, todo
se me alcanza.
— Por la fe de caballero andante —respondió don Quijote—, que, así como vi
este carro, imaginé que alguna grande aventura se me ofrecía; y ahora digo
que es menester tocar las apariencias con la mano para dar lugar al
desengaño. Andad con Dios, buena gente, y haced vuestra fiesta, y mirad si
mandáis algo en que pueda seros de provecho, que lo haré con buen ánimo y
buen talante, porque desde mochacho fui aficionado a la carátula, y en mi
mocedad se me iban los ojos tras la farándula.
Estando en estas pláticas, quiso la suerte que llegase uno de la compañía,
que venía vestido de bojiganga, con muchos cascabeles, y en la punta de un
palo traía tres vejigas de vaca hinchadas; el cual moharracho, llegándose a
don Quijote, comenzó a esgrimir el palo y a sacudir el suelo con las
vejigas, y a dar grandes saltos, sonando los cascabeles, cuya mala visión
así alborotó a Rocinante, que, sin ser poderoso a detenerle don Quijote,
tomando el freno entre los dientes, dio a correr por el campo con más
ligereza que jamás prometieron los huesos de su notomía. Sancho, que
consideró el peligro en que iba su amo de ser derribado, saltó del rucio,
y a toda priesa fue a valerle; pero, cuando a él llegó, ya estaba en
tierra, y junto a él, Rocinante, que, con su amo, vino al suelo: ordinario
fin y paradero de las lozanías de Rocinante y de sus atrevimientos.
Mas, apenas hubo dejado su caballería Sancho por acudir a don Quijote,
cuando el demonio bailador de las vejigas saltó sobre el rucio, y,
sacudiéndole con ellas, el miedo y ruido, más que el dolor de los golpes,
le hizo volar por la campaña hacia el lugar donde iban a hacer la fiesta.
Miraba Sancho la carrera de su rucio y la caída de su amo, y no sabía a
cuál de las dos necesidades acudiría primero; pero, en efecto, como buen
escudero y como buen criado, pudo más con él el amor de su señor que el
cariño de su jumento, puesto que cada vez que veía levantar las vejigas en
el aire y caer sobre las ancas de su rucio eran para él tártagos y sustos
de muerte, y antes quisiera que aquellos golpes se los dieran a él en las
niñas de los ojos que en el más mínimo pelo de la cola de su asno. Con esta
perpleja tribulación llegó donde estaba don Quijote, harto más maltrecho de
lo que él quisiera, y, ayudándole a subir sobre Rocinante, le dijo:
— Señor, el Diablo se ha llevado al rucio.
— ¿Qué diablo? —preguntó don Quijote.
— El de las vejigas —respondió Sancho.
— Pues yo le cobraré —replicó don Quijote—, si bien se encerrase con él en
los más hondos y escuros calabozos del infierno. Sígueme, Sancho, que la
carreta va despacio, y con las mulas della satisfaré la pérdida del rucio.
— No hay para qué hacer esa diligencia, señor —respondió Sancho—: vuestra
merced temple su cólera, que, según me parece, ya el Diablo ha dejado el
rucio, y vuelve a la querencia.
Y así era la verdad; porque, habiendo caído el Diablo con el rucio, por
imitar a don Quijote y a Rocinante, el Diablo se fue a pie al pueblo, y el
jumento se volvió a su amo.
— Con todo eso —dijo don Quijote—, será bien castigar el descomedimiento de
aquel demonio en alguno de los de la carreta, aunque sea el mesmo
emperador.
— Quítesele a vuestra merced eso de la imaginación —replicó Sancho—, y tome
mi consejo, que es que nunca se tome con farsantes, que es gente
favorecida. Recitante he visto yo estar preso por dos muertes y salir
libre y sin costas. Sepa vuesa merced que, como son gentes alegres y de
placer, todos los favorecen, todos los amparan, ayudan y estiman, y más
siendo de aquellos de las compañías reales y de título, que todos, o los
más, en sus trajes y compostura parecen unos príncipes.
— Pues con todo —respondió don Quijote—, no se me ha de ir el demonio
farsante alabando, aunque le favorezca todo el género humano.
Y, diciendo esto, volvió a la carreta, que ya estaba bien cerca del pueblo.
Iba dando voces, diciendo:
— Deteneos, esperad, turba alegre y regocijada, que os quiero dar a entender
cómo se han de tratar los jumentos y alimañas que sirven de caballería a
los escuderos de los caballeros andantes.
Tan altos eran los gritos de don Quijote, que los oyeron y entendieron los
de la carreta; y, juzgando por las palabras la intención del que las decía,
en un instante saltó la Muerte de la carreta, y tras ella, el Emperador, el
Diablo carretero y el Ángel, sin quedarse la Reina ni el dios Cupido; y
todos se cargaron de piedras y se pusieron en ala, esperando recebir a don
Quijote en las puntas de sus guijarros. Don Quijote, que los vio puestos en
tan gallardo escuadrón, los brazos levantados con ademán de despedir
poderosamente las piedras, detuvo las riendas a Rocinante y púsose a pensar
de qué modo los acometería con menos peligro de su persona. En esto que se
detuvo, llegó Sancho, y, viéndole en talle de acometer al bien formado
escuadrón, le dijo:
— Asaz de locura sería intentar tal empresa: considere vuesa merced, señor
mío, que para sopa de arroyo y tente bonete, no hay arma defensiva en el
mundo, si no es embutirse y encerrarse en una campana de bronce; y también
se ha de considerar que es más temeridad que valentía acometer un hombre
solo a un ejército donde está la Muerte, y pelean en persona emperadores, y
a quien ayudan los buenos y los malos ángeles; y si esta consideración no
le mueve a estarse quedo, muévale saber de cierto que, entre todos los que
allí están, aunque parecen reyes, príncipes y emperadores, no hay ningún
caballero andante.
— Ahora sí —dijo don Quijote— has dado, Sancho, en el punto que puede y debe
mudarme de mi ya determinado intento. Yo no puedo ni debo sacar la espada,
como otras veces muchas te he dicho, contra quien no fuere armado
caballero. A ti, Sancho, toca, si quieres tomar la venganza del agravio que
a tu rucio se le ha hecho, que yo desde aquí te ayudaré con voces y
advertimientos saludables.
— No hay para qué, señor —respondió Sancho—, tomar venganza de nadie, pues
no es de buenos cristianos tomarla de los agravios; cuanto más, que yo
acabaré con mi asno que ponga su ofensa en las manos de mi voluntad, la
cual es de vivir pacíficamente los días que los cielos me dieren de vida.
— Pues ésa es tu determinación —replicó don Quijote—, Sancho bueno, Sancho
discreto, Sancho cristiano y Sancho sincero, dejemos estas fantasmas y
volvamos a buscar mejores y más calificadas aventuras; que yo veo esta
tierra de talle, que no han de faltar en ella muchas y muy milagrosas.
Volvió las riendas luego, Sancho fue a tomar su rucio, la Muerte con todo
su escuadrón volante volvieron a su carreta y prosiguieron su viaje, y este
felice fin tuvo la temerosa aventura de la carreta de la Muerte, gracias
sean dadas al saludable consejo que Sancho Panza dio a su amo; al cual, el
día siguiente, le sucedió otra con un enamorado y andante caballero, de no
menos suspensión que la pasada.
Capítulo XII. De la estraña aventura que le sucedió al valeroso don
Quijote con el bravo Caballero de los Espejos
La noche que siguió al día del rencuentro de la Muerte la pasaron don
Quijote y su escudero debajo de unos altos y sombrosos árboles, habiendo, a
persuasión de Sancho, comido don Quijote de lo que venía en el repuesto del
rucio, y entre la cena dijo Sancho a su señor:
— Señor, ¡qué tonto hubiera andado yo si hubiera escogido en albricias los
despojos de la primera aventura que vuestra merced acabara, antes que las
crías de las tres yeguas! En efecto, en efecto, más vale pájaro en mano que
buitre volando.
— Todavía —respondió don Quijote—, si tú, Sancho, me dejaras acometer, como
yo quería, te hubieran cabido en despojos, por lo menos, la corona de oro
de la Emperatriz y las pintadas alas de Cupido, que yo se las quitara al
redropelo y te las pusiera en las manos.
— Nunca los cetros y coronas de los emperadores farsantes —respondió
Sancho Panza— fueron de oro puro, sino de oropel o hoja de lata.
— Así es verdad —replicó don Quijote—, porque no fuera acertado que los
atavíos de la comedia fueran finos, sino fingidos y aparentes, como lo es
la mesma comedia, con la cual quiero, Sancho, que estés bien, teniéndola en
tu gracia, y por el mismo consiguiente a los que las representan y a los
que las componen, porque todos son instrumentos de hacer un gran bien a la
república, poniéndonos un espejo a cada paso delante, donde se veen al vivo
las acciones de la vida humana, y ninguna comparación hay que más al vivo
nos represente lo que somos y lo que habemos de ser como la comedia y los
comediantes. Si no, dime: ¿no has visto tú representar alguna comedia
adonde se introducen reyes, emperadores y pontífices, caballeros, damas y
otros diversos personajes? Uno hace el rufián, otro el embustero, éste el
mercader, aquél el soldado, otro el simple discreto, otro el enamorado
simple; y, acabada la comedia y desnudándose de los vestidos della, quedan
todos los recitantes iguales.
— Sí he visto —respondió Sancho.
— Pues lo mesmo —dijo don Quijote— acontece en la comedia y trato deste
mundo, donde unos hacen los emperadores, otros los pontífices, y,
finalmente, todas cuantas figuras se pueden introducir en una comedia;
pero, en llegando al fin, que es cuando se acaba la vida, a todos les quita
la muerte las ropas que los diferenciaban, y quedan iguales en la
sepultura.
— ¡Brava comparación! —dijo Sancho—, aunque no tan nueva que yo no la haya
oído muchas y diversas veces, como aquella del juego del ajedrez, que,
mientras dura el juego, cada pieza tiene su particular oficio; y, en
acabándose el juego, todas se mezclan, juntan y barajan, y dan con ellas en
una bolsa, que es como dar con la vida en la sepultura.
— Cada día, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, te vas haciendo menos simple y más
discreto.
— Sí, que algo se me ha de pegar de la discreción de vuestra merced
— respondió Sancho—; que las tierras que de suyo son estériles y secas,
estercolándolas y cultivándolas, vienen a dar buenos frutos: quiero decir
que la conversación de vuestra merced ha sido el estiércol que sobre la
estéril tierra de mi seco ingenio ha caído; la cultivación, el tiempo que
ha que le sirvo y comunico; y con esto espero de dar frutos de mí que sean
de bendición, tales, que no desdigan ni deslicen de los senderos de la
buena crianza que vuesa merced ha hecho en el agostado entendimiento mío.
Rióse don Quijote de las afectadas razones de Sancho, y parecióle ser
verdad lo que decía de su emienda, porque de cuando en cuando hablaba de
manera que le admiraba; puesto que todas o las más veces que Sancho quería
hablar de oposición y a lo cortesano, acababa su razón con despeñarse del
monte de su simplicidad al profundo de su ignorancia; y en lo que él se
mostraba más elegante y memorioso era en traer refranes, viniesen o no
viniesen a pelo de lo que trataba, como se habrá visto y se habrá notado en
el discurso desta historia.
En estas y en otras pláticas se les pasó gran parte de la noche, y a Sancho
le vino en voluntad de dejar caer las compuertas de los ojos, como él decía
cuando quería dormir, y, desaliñando al rucio, le dio pasto abundoso y
libre. No quitó la silla a Rocinante, por ser expreso mandamiento de su
señor que, en el tiempo que anduviesen en campaña, o no durmiesen debajo de
techado, no desaliñase a Rocinante: antigua usanza establecida y guardada
de los andantes caballeros, quitar el freno y colgarle del arzón de la
silla; pero, ¿quitar la silla al caballo?, ¡guarda!; y así lo hizo Sancho,
y le dio la misma libertad que al rucio, cuya amistad dél y de Rocinante
fue tan única y tan trabada, que hay fama, por tradición de padres a hijos,
que el autor desta verdadera historia hizo particulares capítulos della;
mas que, por guardar la decencia y decoro que a tan heroica historia se
debe, no los puso en ella, puesto que algunas veces se descuida deste su
prosupuesto, y escribe que, así como las dos bestias se juntaban, acudían a
rascarse el uno al otro, y que, después de cansados y satisfechos, cruzaba
Rocinante el pescuezo sobre el cuello del rucio (que le sobraba de la otra
parte más de media vara), y, mirando los dos atentamente al suelo, se
solían estar de aquella manera tres días; a lo menos, todo el tiempo que
les dejaban, o no les compelía la hambre a buscar sustento.
Digo que dicen que dejó el autor escrito que los había comparado en la
amistad a la que tuvieron Niso y Euríalo, y Pílades y Orestes; y si esto es
así, se podía echar de ver, para universal admiración, cuán firme debió ser
la amistad destos dos pacíficos animales, y para confusión de los hombres,
que tan mal saben guardarse amistad los unos a los otros. Por esto se dijo:
No hay amigo para amigo:
las cañas se vuelven lanzas;
y el otro que cantó:
De amigo a amigo la chinche, etc.
Y no le parezca a alguno que anduvo el autor algo fuera de camino en haber
comparado la amistad destos animales a la de los hombres, que de las
bestias han recebido muchos advertimientos los hombres y aprendido muchas
cosas de importancia, como son: de las cigüeñas, el cristel; de los perros,
el vómito y el agradecimiento; de las grullas, la vigilancia; de las
hormigas, la providencia; de los elefantes, la honestidad, y la lealtad,
del caballo.
Finalmente, Sancho se quedó dormido al pie de un alcornoque, y don Quijote
dormitando al de una robusta encina; pero, poco espacio de tiempo había
pasado, cuando le despertó un ruido que sintió a sus espaldas, y,
levantándose con sobresalto, se puso a mirar y a escuchar de dónde el ruido
procedía, y vio que eran dos hombres a caballo, y que el uno, dejándose
derribar de la silla, dijo al otro:
— Apéate, amigo, y quita los frenos a los caballos, que, a mi parecer, este
sitio abunda de yerba para ellos, y del silencio y soledad que han menester
mis amorosos pensamientos.
El decir esto y el tenderse en el suelo todo fue a un mesmo tiempo; y, al
arrojarse, hicieron ruido las armas de que venía armado, manifiesta señal
por donde conoció don Quijote que debía de ser caballero andante; y,
llegándose a Sancho, que dormía, le trabó del brazo, y con no pequeño
trabajo le volvió en su acuerdo, y con voz baja le dijo:
— Hermano Sancho, aventura tenemos.
— Dios nos la dé buena —respondió Sancho—; y ¿adónde está, señor mío, su
merced de esa señora aventura?
— ¿Adónde, Sancho? —replicó don Quijote—; vuelve los ojos y mira, y verás
allí tendido un andante caballero, que, a lo que a mí se me trasluce, no
debe de estar demasiadamente alegre, porque le vi arrojar del caballo y
tenderse en el suelo con algunas muestras de despecho, y al caer le
crujieron las armas.
— Pues ¿en qué halla vuesa merced —dijo Sancho— que ésta sea aventura?
— No quiero yo decir —respondió don Quijote— que ésta sea aventura del todo,
sino principio della; que por aquí se comienzan las aventuras. Pero
escucha, que, a lo que parece, templando está un laúd o vigüela, y, según
escupe y se desembaraza el pecho, debe de prepararse para cantar algo.
— A buena fe que es así —respondió Sancho—, y que debe de ser caballero
enamorado.
— No hay ninguno de los andantes que no lo sea —dijo don Quijote—. Y
escuchémosle, que por el hilo sacaremos el ovillo de sus pensamientos, si
es que canta; que de la abundancia del corazón habla la lengua.
Replicar quería Sancho a su amo, pero la voz del Caballero del Bosque, que
no era muy mala mi muy buena, lo estorbó; y, estando los dos atónitos,
oyeron que lo que cantó fue este soneto:
— Dadme, señora, un término que siga,
conforme a vuestra voluntad cortado;
que será de la mía así estimado,
que por jamás un punto dél desdiga.
Si gustáis que callando mi fatiga
muera, contadme ya por acabado:
si queréis que os la cuente en desusado
modo, haré que el mesmo amor la diga.
A prueba de contrarios estoy hecho,
de blanda cera y de diamante duro,
y a las leyes de amor el ama ajusto.
Blando cual es, o fuerte, ofrezco el pecho:
entallad o imprimid lo que os dé gusto,
que de guardarlo eternamente juro.
Con un ¡ay!, arrancado, al parecer, de lo íntimo de su corazón, dio fin a
su canto el Caballero del Bosque, y, de allí a un poco, con voz doliente y
lastimada, dijo:
— ¡Oh la más hermosa y la más ingrata mujer del orbe! ¿Cómo que será
posible, serenísima Casildea de Vandalia, que has de consentir que se
consuma y acabe en continuas peregrinaciones y en ásperos y duros trabajos
este tu cautivo caballero? ¿No basta ya que he hecho que te confiesen por
la más hermosa del mundo todos los caballeros de Navarra, todos los
leoneses, todos los tartesios, todos los castellanos, y, finalmente, todos
los caballeros de la Mancha?
— Eso no —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, que yo soy de la Mancha y nunca
tal he confesado, ni podía ni debía confesar una cosa tan perjudicial a la
belleza de mi señora; y este tal caballero ya vees tú, Sancho, que
desvaría. Pero, escuchemos: quizá se declarará más.
— Si hará —replicó Sancho—, que término lleva de quejarse un mes arreo.
Pero no fue así, porque, habiendo entreoído el Caballero del Bosque que
hablaban cerca dél, sin pasar adelante en su lamentación, se puso en pie, y
dijo con voz sonora y comedida:
— ¿Quién va allá? ¿Qué gente? ¿Es por ventura de la del número de los
contentos, o la del de los afligidos?
— De los afligidos —respondió don Quijote.
— Pues lléguese a mí —respondió el del Bosque—, y hará cuenta que se llega
a la mesma tristeza y a la aflición mesma.
Don Quijote, que se vio responder tan tierna y comedidamente, se llegó a
él, y Sancho ni más ni menos.
El caballero lamentador asió a don Quijote del brazo, diciendo:
— Sentaos aquí, señor caballero, que para entender que lo sois, y de los que
profesan la andante caballería, bástame el haberos hallado en este lugar,
donde la soledad y el sereno os hacen compañía, naturales lechos y propias
estancias de los caballeros andantes.
A lo que respondió don Quijote:
— Caballero soy, y de la profesión que decís; y, aunque en mi alma tienen su
propio asiento las tristezas, las desgracias y las desventuras, no por eso
se ha ahuyentado della la compasión que tengo de las ajenas desdichas. De
lo que contaste poco ha, colegí que las vuestras son enamoradas, quiero
decir, del amor que tenéis a aquella hermosa ingrata que en vuestras
lamentaciones nombrastes.
Ya cuando esto pasaban estaban sentados juntos sobre la dura tierra, en
buena paz y compañía, como si al romper del día no se hubieran de romper
las cabezas.
— Por ventura, señor caballero —preguntó el del Bosque a don Quijote—, ¿sois
enamorado?
— Por desventura lo soy —respondió don Quijote—; aunque los daños que nacen
de los bien colocados pensamientos, antes se deben tener por gracias que
por desdichas.
— Así es la verdad —replicó el del Bosque—, si no nos turbasen la razón y el
entendimiento los desdenes, que, siendo muchos, parecen venganzas.
— Nunca fui desdeñado de mi señora —respondió don Quijote.
— No, por cierto —dijo Sancho, que allí junto estaba—, porque es mi señora
como una borrega mansa: es más blanda que una manteca.
— ¿Es vuestro escudero éste? —preguntó el del Bosque.
— Sí es —respondió don Quijote.
— Nunca he visto yo escudero —replicó el del Bosque— que se atreva a hablar
donde habla su señor; a lo menos, ahí está ese mío, que es tan grande como
su padre, y no se probará que haya desplegado el labio donde yo hablo.
— Pues a fe —dijo Sancho—, que he hablado yo, y puedo hablar delante de otro
tan..., y aun quédese aquí, que es peor meneallo.
El escudero del Bosque asió por el brazo a Sancho, diciéndole:
— Vámonos los dos donde podamos hablar escuderilmente todo cuanto
quisiéremos, y dejemos a estos señores amos nuestros que se den de las
astas, contándose las historias de sus amores; que a buen seguro que les ha
de coger el día en ellas y no las han de haber acabado.
— Sea en buena hora —dijo Sancho—; y yo le diré a vuestra merced quién soy,
para que vea si puedo entrar en docena con los más hablantes escuderos.
Con esto se apartaron los dos escuderos, entre los cuales pasó un tan
gracioso coloquio como fue grave el que pasó entre sus señores.
Capítulo XIII. Donde se prosigue la aventura del Caballero del Bosque, con
el discreto, nuevo y suave coloquio que pasó entre los dos escuderos
Divididos estaban caballeros y escuderos: éstos contándose sus vidas, y
aquéllos sus amores; pero la historia cuenta primero el razonamiento de los
mozos y luego prosigue el de los amos; y así, dice que, apartándose un poco
dellos, el del Bosque dijo a Sancho:
— Trabajosa vida es la que pasamos y vivimos, señor mío, estos que somos
escuderos de caballeros andantes: en verdad que comemos el pan en el sudor
de nuestros rostros, que es una de las maldiciones que echó Dios a nuestros
primeros padres.
— También se puede decir —añadió Sancho— que lo comemos en el yelo de
nuestros cuerpos; porque, ¿quién más calor y más frío que los miserables
escuderos de la andante caballería? Y aun menos mal si comiéramos, pues los
duelos, con pan son menos; pero tal vez hay que se nos pasa un día y dos
sin desayunarnos, si no es del viento que sopla.
— Todo eso se puede llevar y conllevar —dijo el del Bosque—, con la
esperanza que tenemos del premio; porque si demasiadamente no es
desgraciado el caballero andante a quien un escudero sirve, por lo menos, a
pocos lances se verá premiado con un hermoso gobierno de cualque ínsula, o
con un condado de buen parecer.
Yo —replicó Sancho— ya he dicho a mi amo que me contento con el gobierno de
alguna ínsula; y él es tan noble y tan liberal, que me le ha prometido
muchas y diversas veces.
Yo —dijo el del Bosque—, con un canonicato quedaré satisfecho de mis
servicios, y ya me le tiene mandado mi amo, y ¡qué tal!
— Debe de ser —dijo Sancho— su amo de vuesa merced caballero a lo
eclesiástico, y podrá hacer esas mercedes a sus buenos escuderos; pero el
mío es meramente lego, aunque yo me acuerdo cuando le querían aconsejar
personas discretas, aunque, a mi parecer mal intencionadas, que procurase
ser arzobispo; pero él no quiso sino ser emperador, y yo estaba entonces
temblando si le venía en voluntad de ser de la Iglesia, por no hallarme
suficiente de tener beneficios por ella; porque le hago saber a vuesa
merced que, aunque parezco hombre, soy una bestia para ser de la Iglesia.
— Pues en verdad que lo yerra vuesa merced —dijo el del Bosque—, a causa que
los gobiernos insulanos no son todos de buena data. Algunos hay torcidos,
algunos pobres, algunos malencónicos, y finalmente, el más erguido y bien
dispuesto trae consigo una pesada carga de pensamientos y de incomodidades,
que pone sobre sus hombros el desdichado que le cupo en suerte. Harto mejor
sería que los que profesamos esta maldita servidumbre nos retirásemos a
nuestras casas, y allí nos entretuviésemos en ejercicios más suaves, como
si dijésemos, cazando o pescando; que, ¿qué escudero hay tan pobre en el
mundo, a quien le falte un rocín, y un par de galgos, y una caña de pescar,
con que entretenerse en su aldea?
— A mí no me falta nada deso —respondió Sancho—: verdad es que no tengo
rocín, pero tengo un asno que vale dos veces más que el caballo de mi amo.
Mala pascua me dé Dios, y sea la primera que viniere, si le trocara por él,
aunque me diesen cuatro fanegas de cebada encima. A burla tendrá vuesa
merced el valor de mi rucio, que rucio es el color de mi jumento. Pues
galgos no me habían de faltar, habiéndolos sobrados en mi pueblo; y más,
que entonces es la caza más gustosa cuando se hace a costa ajena.
— Real y verdaderamente —respondió el del Bosque—, señor escudero, que tengo
propuesto y determinado de dejar estas borracherías destos caballeros, y
retirarme a mi aldea, y criar mis hijitos, que tengo tres como tres
orientales perlas.
— Dos tengo yo —dijo Sancho—, que se pueden presentar al Papa en persona,
especialmente una muchacha a quien crío para condesa, si Dios fuere
servido, aunque a pesar de su madre.
— Y ¿qué edad tiene esa señora que se cría para condesa? —preguntó el del
Bosque.
— Quince años, dos más a menos —respondió Sancho—, pero es tan grande como
una lanza, y tan fresca como una mañana de abril, y tiene una fuerza de un
ganapán.
— Partes son ésas —respondió el del Bosque— no sólo para ser condesa, sino
para ser ninfa del verde bosque. ¡Oh hideputa, puta, y qué rejo debe de
tener la bellaca!
A lo que respondió Sancho, algo mohíno:
— Ni ella es puta, ni lo fue su madre, ni lo será ninguna de las dos, Dios
quiriendo, mientras yo viviere. Y háblese más comedidamente, que, para
haberse criado vuesa merced entre caballeros andantes, que son la mesma
cortesía, no me parecen muy concertadas esas palabras.
— ¡Oh, qué mal se le entiende a vuesa merced —replicó el del Bosque— de
achaque de alabanzas, señor escudero! ¿Cómo y no sabe que cuando algún
caballero da una buena lanzada al toro en la plaza, o cuando alguna persona
hace alguna cosa bien hecha, suele decir el vulgo: "¡Oh hideputa, puto, y
qué bien que lo ha hecho!?" Y aquello que parece vituperio, en aquel
término, es alabanza notable; y renegad vos, señor, de los hijos o hijas
que no hacen obras que merezcan se les den a sus padres loores semejantes.
— Sí reniego —respondió Sancho—, y dese modo y por esa misma razón podía
echar vuestra merced a mí y hijos y a mi mujer toda una putería encima,
porque todo cuanto hacen y dicen son estremos dignos de semejantes
alabanzas, y para volverlos a ver ruego yo a Dios me saque de pecado
mortal, que lo mesmo será si me saca deste peligroso oficio de escudero, en
el cual he incurrido segunda vez, cebado y engañado de una bolsa con cien
ducados que me hallé un día en el corazón de Sierra Morena, y el diablo me
pone ante los ojos aquí, allí, acá no, sino acullá, un talego lleno de
doblones, que me parece que a cada paso le toco con la mano, y me abrazo
con él, y lo llevo a mi casa, y echo censos, y fundo rentas, y vivo como un
príncipe; y el rato que en esto pienso se me hacen fáciles y llevaderos
cuantos trabajos padezco con este mentecato de mi amo, de quien sé que
tiene más de loco que de caballero.
— Por eso —respondió el del Bosque— dicen que la codicia rompe el saco; y si
va a tratar dellos, no hay otro mayor en el mundo que mi amo, porque es de
aquellos que dicen: "Cuidados ajenos matan al asno"; pues, porque cobre
otro caballero el juicio que ha perdido, se hace el loco, y anda buscando
lo que no sé si después de hallado le ha de salir a los hocicos.
— Y ¿es enamorado, por dicha?
— Sí —dijo el del Bosque—: de una tal Casildea de Vandalia, la más cruda y
la más asada señora que en todo el orbe puede hallarse; pero no cojea del
pie de la crudeza, que otros mayores embustes le gruñen en las entrañas, y
ello dirá antes de muchas horas.
— No hay camino tan llano —replicó Sancho— que no tenga algún tropezón o
barranco; en otras casas cuecen habas, y en la mía, a calderadas; más
acompañados y paniaguados debe de tener la locura que la discreción. Mas si
es verdad lo que comúnmente se dice, que el tener compañeros en los
trabajos suele servir de alivio en ellos, con vuestra merced podré
consolarme, pues sirve a otro amo tan tonto como el mío.
— Tonto, pero valiente —respondió el del Bosque—, y más bellaco que tonto y
que valiente.
— Eso no es el mío —respondió Sancho—: digo, que no tiene nada de bellaco;
antes tiene una alma como un cántaro: no sabe hacer mal a nadie, sino bien
a todos, ni tiene malicia alguna: un niño le hará entender que es de noche
en la mitad del día; y por esta sencillez le quiero como a las telas de mi
corazón, y no me amaño a dejarle, por más disparates que haga.
— Con todo eso, hermano y señor —dijo el del Bosque—, si el ciego guía al
ciego, ambos van a peligro de caer en el hoyo. Mejor es retirarnos con buen
compás de pies, y volvernos a nuestras querencias; que los que buscan
aventuras no siempre las hallan buenas.
Escupía Sancho a menudo, al parecer, un cierto género de saliva pegajosa y
algo seca; lo cual visto y notado por el caritativo bosqueril escudero,
dijo:
— Paréceme que de lo que hemos hablado se nos pegan al paladar las lenguas;
pero yo traigo un despegador pendiente del arzón de mi caballo, que es tal
como bueno.
Y, levantándose, volvió desde allí a un poco con una gran bota de vino y
una empanada de media vara; y no es encarecimiento, porque era de un conejo
albar, tan grande que Sancho, al tocarla, entendió ser de algún cabrón, no
que de cabrito; lo cual visto por Sancho, dijo:
— Y ¿esto trae vuestra merced consigo, señor?
— Pues, ¿qué se pensaba? —respondió el otro—. ¿Soy yo por ventura algún
escudero de agua y lana? Mejor repuesto traigo yo en las ancas de mi
caballo que lleva consigo cuando va de camino un general.
Comió Sancho sin hacerse de rogar, y tragaba a escuras bocados de nudos de
suelta. Y dijo:
— Vuestra merced sí que es escudero fiel y legal, moliente y corriente,
magnífico y grande, como lo muestra este banquete, que si no ha venido aquí
por arte de encantamento, parécelo, a lo menos; y no como yo, mezquino y
malaventurado, que sólo traigo en mis alforjas un poco de queso, tan duro
que pueden descalabrar con ello a un gigante, a quien hacen compañía cuatro
docenas de algarrobas y otras tantas de avellanas y nueces, mercedes a la
estrecheza de mi dueño, y a la opinión que tiene y orden que guarda de que
los caballeros andantes no se han de mantener y sustentar sino con frutas
secas y con las yerbas del campo.
— Por mi fe, hermano —replicó el del Bosque—, que yo no tengo hecho el
estómago a tagarninas, ni a piruétanos, ni a raíces de los montes. Allá se
lo hayan con sus opiniones y leyes caballerescas nuestros amos, y coman lo
que ellos mandaren. Fiambreras traigo, y esta bota colgando del arzón de la
silla, por sí o por no; y es tan devota mía y quiérola tanto, que pocos
ratos se pasan sin que la dé mil besos y mil abrazos.
Y, diciendo esto, se la puso en las manos a Sancho, el cual, empinándola,
puesta a la boca, estuvo mirando las estrellas un cuarto de hora, y, en
acabando de beber, dejó caer la cabeza a un lado, y, dando un gran suspiro,
dijo:
— ¡Oh hideputa bellaco, y cómo es católico!
— ¿Veis ahí —dijo el del Bosque, en oyendo el hideputa de Sancho—, cómo
habéis alabado este vino llamándole hideputa?
— Digo —respondió Sancho—, que confieso que conozco que no es deshonra
llamar hijo de puta a nadie, cuando cae debajo del entendimiento de
alabarle. Pero dígame, señor, por el siglo de lo que más quiere: ¿este vino
es de Ciudad Real?
— ¡Bravo mojón! —respondió el del Bosque—. En verdad que no es de otra
parte, y que tiene algunos años de ancianidad.
— ¡A mí con eso! —dijo Sancho—. No toméis menos, sino que se me fuera a mí
por alto dar alcance a su conocimiento. ¿No será bueno, señor escudero, que
tenga yo un instinto tan grande y tan natural, en esto de conocer vinos,
que, en dándome a oler cualquiera, acierto la patria, el linaje, el sabor,
y la dura, y las vueltas que ha de dar, con todas las circunstancias al
vino atañederas? Pero no hay de qué maravillarse, si tuve en mi linaje por
parte de mi padre los dos más excelentes mojones que en luengos años
conoció la Mancha; para prueba de lo cual les sucedió lo que ahora diré:
«Diéronles a los dos a probar del vino de una cuba, pidiéndoles su parecer
del estado, cualidad, bondad o malicia del vino. El uno lo probó con la
punta de la lengua, el otro no hizo más de llegarlo a las narices. El
primero dijo que aquel vino sabía a hierro, el segundo dijo que más sabía a
cordobán. El dueño dijo que la cuba estaba limpia, y que el tal vino no
tenía adobo alguno por donde hubiese tomado sabor de hierro ni de cordobán.
Con todo eso, los dos famosos mojones se afirmaron en lo que habían dicho.
Anduvo el tiempo, vendióse el vino, y al limpiar de la cuba hallaron en
ella una llave pequeña, pendiente de una correa de cordobán.» Porque vea
vuestra merced si quien viene desta ralea podrá dar su parecer en
semejantes causas.
— Por eso digo —dijo el del Bosque— que nos dejemos de andar buscando
aventuras; y, pues tenemos hogazas, no busquemos tortas, y volvámonos a
nuestras chozas, que allí nos hallará Dios, si Él quiere.
— Hasta que mi amo llegue a Zaragoza, le serviré; que después todos nos
entenderemos.
Finalmente, tanto hablaron y tanto bebieron los dos buenos escuderos, que
tuvo necesidad el sueño de atarles las lenguas y templarles la sed, que
quitársela fuera imposible; y así, asidos entrambos de la ya casi vacía
bota, con los bocados a medio mascar en la boca, se quedaron dormidos,
donde los dejaremos por ahora, por contar lo que el Caballero del Bosque
pasó con el de la Triste Figura.
Capítulo XIV. Donde se prosigue la aventura del Caballero del Bosque
Entre muchas razones que pasaron don Quijote y el Caballero de la Selva,
dice la historia que el del Bosque dijo a don Quijote:
— Finalmente, señor caballero, quiero que sepáis que mi destino, o, por
mejor decir, mi elección, me trujo a enamorar de la sin par Casildea de
Vandalia. Llámola sin par porque no le tiene, así en la grandeza del cuerpo
como en el estremo del estado y de la hermosura. Esta tal Casildea, pues,
que voy contando, pagó mis buenos pensamientos y comedidos deseos con
hacerme ocupar, como su madrina a Hércules, en muchos y diversos peligros,
prometiéndome al fin de cada uno que en el fin del otro llegaría el de mi
esperanza; pero así se han ido eslabonando mis trabajos, que no tienen
cuento, ni yo sé cuál ha de ser el último que dé principio al cumplimiento
de mis buenos deseos. Una vez me mandó que fuese a desafiar a aquella
famosa giganta de Sevilla llamada la Giralda, que es tan valiente y fuerte
como hecha de bronce, y, sin mudarse de un lugar, es la más movible y
voltaria mujer del mundo. Llegué, vila, y vencíla, y hícela estar queda y a
raya, porque en más de una semana no soplaron sino vientos nortes. Vez
también hubo que me mandó fuese a tomar en peso las antiguas piedras de los
valientes Toros de Guisando, empresa más para encomendarse a ganapanes que
a caballeros. Otra vez me mandó que me precipitase y sumiese en la sima de
Cabra, peligro inaudito y temeroso, y que le trujese particular relación de
lo que en aquella escura profundidad se encierra. Detuve el movimiento a la
Giralda, pesé los Toros de Guisando, despeñéme en la sima y saqué a luz lo
escondido de su abismo, y mis esperanzas, muertas que muertas, y sus
mandamientos y desdenes, vivos que vivos. En resolución, últimamente me ha
mandado que discurra por todas las provincias de España y haga confesar a
todos los andantes caballeros que por ellas vagaren que ella sola es la más
aventajada en hermosura de cuantas hoy viven, y que yo soy el más valiente
y el más bien enamorado caballero del orbe; en cuya demanda he andado ya la
mayor parte de España, y en ella he vencido muchos caballeros que se han
atrevido a contradecirme. Pero de lo que yo más me precio y ufano es de
haber vencido, en singular batalla, a aquel tan famoso caballero don
Quijote de la Mancha, y héchole confesar que es más hermosa mi Casildea que
su Dulcinea; y en solo este vencimiento hago cuenta que he vencido todos
los caballeros del mundo, porque el tal don Quijote que digo los ha vencido
a todos; y, habiéndole yo vencido a él, su gloria, su fama y su honra se ha
transferido y pasado a mi persona;
y tanto el vencedor es más honrado,
cuanto más el vencido es reputado;
así que, ya corren por mi cuenta y son mías las inumerables hazañas del ya
referido don Quijote.
Admirado quedó don Quijote de oír al Caballero del Bosque, y estuvo mil
veces por decirle que mentía, y ya tuvo el mentís en el pico de la lengua;
pero reportóse lo mejor que pudo, por hacerle confesar por su propia boca
su mentira; y así, sosegadamente le dijo:
— De que vuesa merced, señor caballero, haya vencido a los más caballeros
andantes de España, y aun de todo el mundo, no digo nada; pero de que haya
vencido a don Quijote de la Mancha, póngolo en duda. Podría ser que fuese
otro que le pareciese, aunque hay pocos que le parezcan.
— ¿Cómo no? —replicó el del Bosque—. Por el cielo que nos cubre, que peleé
con don Quijote, y le vencí y rendí; y es un hombre alto de cuerpo, seco de
rostro, estirado y avellanado de miembros, entrecano, la nariz aguileña y
algo corva, de bigotes grandes, negros y caídos. Campea debajo del nombre
del Caballero de la Triste Figura, y trae por escudero a un labrador
llamado Sancho Panza; oprime el lomo y rige el freno de un famoso caballo
llamado Rocinante, y, finalmente, tiene por señora de su voluntad a una tal
Dulcinea del Toboso, llamada un tiempo Aldonza Lorenzo; como la mía, que,
por llamarse Casilda y ser de la Andalucía, yo la llamo Casildea de
Vandalia. Si todas estas señas no bastan para acreditar mi verdad, aquí
está mi espada, que la hará dar crédito a la mesma incredulidad.
— Sosegaos, señor caballero —dijo don Quijote—, y escuchad lo que decir os
quiero. Habéis de saber que ese don Quijote que decís es el mayor amigo que
en este mundo tengo, y tanto, que podré decir que le tengo en lugar de mi
misma persona, y que por las señas que dél me habéis dado, tan puntuales y
ciertas, no puedo pensar sino que sea el mismo que habéis vencido. Por otra
parte, veo con los ojos y toco con las manos no ser posible ser el mesmo,
si ya no fuese que como él tiene muchos enemigos encantadores,
especialmente uno que de ordinario le persigue, no haya alguno dellos
tomado su figura para dejarse vencer, por defraudarle de la fama que sus
altas caballerías le tienen granjeada y adquirida por todo lo descubierto
de la tierra. Y, para confirmación desto, quiero también que sepáis que los
tales encantadores sus contrarios no ha más de dos días que transformaron
la figura y persona de la hermosa Dulcinea del Toboso en una aldeana soez y
baja, y desta manera habrán transformado a don Quijote; y si todo esto no
basta para enteraros en esta verdad que digo, aquí está el mesmo don
Quijote, que la sustentará con sus armas a pie, o a caballo, o de
cualquiera suerte que os agradare.
Y, diciendo esto, se levantó en pie y se empuñó en la espada, esperando qué
resolución tomaría el Caballero del Bosque; el cual, con voz asimismo
sosegada, respondió y dijo:
— Al buen pagador no le duelen prendas: el que una vez, señor don Quijote,
pudo venceros transformado, bien podrá tener esperanza de rendiros en
vuestro propio ser. Mas, porque no es bien que los caballeros hagan sus
fechos de armas ascuras, como los salteadores y rufianes, esperemos el día,
para que el sol vea nuestras obras. Y ha de ser condición de nuestra
batalla que el vencido ha de quedar a la voluntad del vencedor, para que
haga dél todo lo que quisiere, con tal que sea decente a caballero lo que
se le ordenare.
— Soy más que contento desa condición y convenencia —respondió don Quijote.
Y, en diciendo esto, se fueron donde estaban sus escuderos, y los hallaron
roncando y en la misma forma que estaban cuando les salteó el sueño.
Despertáronlos y mandáronles que tuviesen a punto los caballos, porque, en
saliendo el sol, habían de hacer los dos una sangrienta, singular y
desigual batalla; a cuyas nuevas quedó Sancho atónito y pasmado, temeroso
de la salud de su amo, por las valentías que había oído decir del suyo al
escudero del Bosque; pero, sin hablar palabra, se fueron los dos escuderos
a buscar su ganado, que ya todos tres caballos y el rucio se habían olido,
y estaban todos juntos.
En el camino dijo el del Bosque a Sancho:
— Ha de saber, hermano, que tienen por costumbre los peleantes de la
Andalucía, cuando son padrinos de alguna pendencia, no estarse ociosos mano
sobre mano en tanto que sus ahijados riñen. Dígolo porque esté advertido
que mientras nuestros dueños riñeren, nosotros también hemos de pelear y
hacernos astillas.
— Esa costumbre, señor escudero —respondió Sancho—, allá puede correr y
pasar con los rufianes y peleantes que dice, pero con los escuderos de los
caballeros andantes, ni por pienso. A lo menos, yo no he oído decir a mi
amo semejante costumbre, y sabe de memoria todas las ordenanzas de la
andante caballería. Cuanto más, que yo quiero que sea verdad y ordenanza
expresa el pelear los escuderos en tanto que sus señores pelean; pero yo no
quiero cumplirla, sino pagar la pena que estuviere puesta a los tales
pacíficos escuderos, que yo aseguro que no pase de dos libras de cera, y
más quiero pagar las tales libras, que sé que me costarán menos que las
hilas que podré gastar en curarme la cabeza, que ya me la cuento por
partida y dividida en dos partes. Hay más: que me imposibilita el reñir el
no tener espada, pues en mi vida me la puse.
— Para eso sé yo un buen remedio —dijo el del Bosque—: yo traigo aquí dos
talegas de lienzo, de un mesmo tamaño: tomaréis vos la una, y yo la otra, y
riñiremos a talegazos, con armas iguales.
— Desa manera, sea en buena hora —respondió Sancho—, porque antes servirá la
tal pelea de despolvorearnos que de herirnos.
— No ha de ser así —replicó el otro—, porque se han de echar dentro de las
talegas, porque no se las lleve el aire, media docena de guijarros lindos y
pelados, que pesen tanto los unos como los otros, y desta manera nos
podremos atalegar sin hacernos mal ni daño.
— ¡Mirad, cuerpo de mi padre —respondió Sancho—, qué martas cebollinas, o
qué copos de algodón cardado pone en las talegas, para no quedar molidos
los cascos y hechos alheña los huesos! Pero, aunque se llenaran de capullos
de seda, sepa, señor mío, que no he de pelear: peleen nuestros amos, y allá
se lo hayan, y bebamos y vivamos nosotros, que el tiempo tiene cuidado de
quitarnos las vidas, sin que andemos buscando apetites para que se acaben
antes de llegar su sazón y término y que se cayan de maduras.
— Con todo —replicó el del Bosque—, hemos de pelear siquiera media hora.
— Eso no —respondió Sancho—: no seré yo tan descortés ni tan desagradecido,
que con quien he comido y he bebido trabe cuestión alguna, por mínima que
sea; cuanto más que, estando sin cólera y sin enojo, ¿quién diablos se ha
de amañar a reñir a secas?
— Para eso —dijo el del Bosque— yo daré un suficiente remedio: y es que,
antes que comencemos la pelea, yo me llegaré bonitamente a vuestra merced
y le daré tres o cuatro bofetadas, que dé con él a mis pies, con las cuales
le haré despertar la cólera, aunque esté con más sueño que un lirón.
— Contra ese corte sé yo otro —respondió Sancho—, que no le va en zaga:
cogeré yo un garrote, y, antes que vuestra merced llegue a despertarme la
cólera, haré yo dormir a garrotazos de tal suerte la suya, que no despierte
si no fuere en el otro mundo, en el cual se sabe que no soy yo hombre que
me dejo manosear el rostro de nadie; y cada uno mire por el virote, aunque
lo más acertado sería dejar dormir su cólera a cada uno, que no sabe nadie
el alma de nadie, y tal suele venir por lana que vuelve tresquilado; y Dios
bendijo la paz y maldijo las riñas, porque si un gato acosado, encerrado y
apretado se vuelve en león, yo, que soy hombre, Dios sabe en lo que podré
volverme; y así, desde ahora intimo a vuestra merced, señor escudero, que
corra por su cuenta todo el mal y daño que de nuestra pendencia resultare.
— Está bien —replicó el del Bosque—. Amanecerá Dios y medraremos.
En esto, ya comenzaban a gorjear en los árboles mil suertes de pintados
pajarillos, y en sus diversos y alegres cantos parecía que daban la
norabuena y saludaban a la fresca aurora, que ya por las puertas y balcones
del oriente iba descubriendo la hermosura de su rostro, sacudiendo de sus
cabellos un número infinito de líquidas perlas, en cuyo suave licor
bañándose las yerbas, parecía asimesmo que ellas brotaban y llovían
blanco y menudo aljófar; los sauces destilaban maná sabroso, reíanse las
fuentes, murmuraban los arroyos, alegrábanse las selvas y enriquecíanse los
prados con su venida. Mas, apenas dio lugar la claridad del día para ver y
diferenciar las cosas, cuando la primera que se ofreció a los ojos de
Sancho Panza fue la nariz del escudero del Bosque, que era tan grande que
casi le hacía sombra a todo el cuerpo. Cuéntase, en efecto, que era de
demasiada grandeza, corva en la mitad y toda llena de verrugas, de color
amoratado, como de berenjena; bajábale dos dedos más abajo de la boca; cuya
grandeza, color, verrugas y encorvamiento así le afeaban el rostro, que, en
viéndole Sancho, comenzó a herir de pie y de mano, como niño con alferecía,
y propuso en su corazón de dejarse dar docientas bofetadas antes que
despertar la cólera para reñir con aquel vestiglo.
Don Quijote miró a su contendor, y hallóle ya puesta y calada la celada, de
modo que no le pudo ver el rostro, pero notó que era hombre membrudo, y no
muy alto de cuerpo. Sobre las armas traía una sobrevista o casaca de una
tela, al parecer, de oro finísimo, sembradas por ella muchas lunas pequeñas
de resplandecientes espejos, que le hacían en grandísima manera galán y
vistoso; volábanle sobre la celada grande cantidad de plumas verdes,
amarillas y blancas; la lanza, que tenía arrimada a un árbol, era
grandísima y gruesa, y de un hierro acerado de más de un palmo.
Todo lo miró y todo lo notó don Quijote, y juzgó de lo visto y mirado que
el ya dicho caballero debía de ser de grandes fuerzas; pero no por eso
temió, como Sancho Panza; antes, con gentil denuedo, dijo al Caballero de
los Espejos:
— Si la mucha gana de pelear, señor caballero, no os gasta la cortesía, por
ella os pido que alcéis la visera un poco, porque yo vea si la gallardía de
vuestro rostro responde a la de vuestra disposición.
— O vencido o vencedor que salgáis desta empresa, señor caballero —respondió
el de los Espejos—, os quedará tiempo y espacio demasiado para verme; y si
ahora no satisfago a vuestro deseo, es por parecerme que hago notable
agravio a la hermosa Casildea de Vandalia en dilatar el tiempo que tardare
en alzarme la visera, sin haceros confesar lo que ya sabéis que pretendo.
— Pues, en tanto que subimos a caballo —dijo don Quijote—, bien podéis
decirme si soy yo aquel don Quijote que dijistes haber vencido.
— A eso vos respondemos —dijo el de los Espejos— que parecéis, como se
parece un huevo a otro, al mismo caballero que yo vencí; pero, según vos
decís que le persiguen encantadores, no osaré afirmar si sois el contenido
o no.
— Eso me basta a mí —respondió don Quijote— para que crea vuestro engaño;
empero, para sacaros dél de todo punto, vengan nuestros caballos; que, en
menos tiempo que el que tardárades en alzaros la visera, si Dios, si mi
señora y mi brazo me valen, veré yo vuestro rostro, y vos veréis que no soy
yo el vencido don Quijote que pensáis.
Con esto, acortando razones, subieron a caballo, y don Quijote volvió las
riendas a Rocinante para tomar lo que convenía del campo, para volver a
encontrar a su contrario, y lo mesmo hizo el de los Espejos. Pero, no se
había apartado don Quijote veinte pasos, cuando se oyó llamar del de los
Espejos, y, partiendo los dos el camino, el de los Espejos le dijo:
— Advertid, señor caballero, que la condición de nuestra batalla es que el
vencido, como otra vez he dicho, ha de quedar a discreción del vencedor.
— Ya la sé —respondió don Quijote—; con tal que lo que se le impusiere y
mandare al vencido han de ser cosas que no salgan de los límites de la
caballería.
— Así se entiende —respondió el de los Espejos.
Ofreciéronsele en esto a la vista de don Quijote las estrañas narices del
escudero, y no se admiró menos de verlas que Sancho; tanto, que le juzgó
por algún monstro, o por hombre nuevo y de aquellos que no se usan en el
mundo. Sancho, que vio partir a su amo para tomar carrera, no quiso quedar
solo con el narigudo, temiendo que con solo un pasagonzalo con aquellas
narices en las suyas sería acabada la pendencia suya, quedando del golpe, o
del miedo, tendido en el suelo, y fuese tras su amo, asido a una acción de
Rocinante; y, cuando le pareció que ya era tiempo que volviese, le dijo:
— Suplico a vuesa merced, señor mío, que antes que vuelva a encontrarse me
ayude a subir sobre aquel alcornoque, de donde podré ver más a mi sabor,
mejor que desde el suelo, el gallardo encuentro que vuesa merced ha de
hacer con este caballero.
— Antes creo, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que te quieres encaramar y subir en
andamio por ver sin peligro los toros.
— La verdad que diga —respondió Sancho—, las desaforadas narices de aquel
escudero me tienen atónito y lleno de espanto, y no me atrevo a estar junto
a él.
— Ellas son tales —dijo don Quijote—, que, a no ser yo quien soy, también me
asombraran; y así, ven: ayudarte he a subir donde dices.
En lo que se detuvo don Quijote en que Sancho subiese en el alcornoque,
tomó el de los Espejos del campo lo que le pareció necesario; y, creyendo
que lo mismo habría hecho don Quijote, sin esperar son de trompeta ni otra
señal que los avisase, volvió las riendas a su caballo —que no era más
ligero ni de mejor parecer que Rocinante—, y, a todo su correr, que era un
mediano trote, iba a encontrar a su enemigo; pero, viéndole ocupado en la
subida de Sancho, detuvo las riendas y paróse en la mitad de la carrera, de
lo que el caballo quedó agradecidísimo, a causa que ya no podía moverse.
Don Quijote, que le pareció que ya su enemigo venía volando, arrimó
reciamente las espuelas a las trasijadas ijadas de Rocinante, y le hizo
aguijar de manera, que cuenta la historia que esta sola vez se conoció
haber corrido algo, porque todas las demás siempre fueron trotes
declarados; y con esta no vista furia llegó donde el de los Espejos estaba
hincando a su caballo las espuelas hasta los botones, sin que le pudiese
mover un solo dedo del lugar donde había hecho estanco de su carrera.
En esta buena sazón y coyuntura halló don Quijote a su contrario embarazado
con su caballo y ocupado con su lanza, que nunca, o no acertó, o no tuvo
lugar de ponerla en ristre. Don Quijote, que no miraba en estos
inconvenientes, a salvamano y sin peligro alguno, encontró al de los
Espejos con tanta fuerza, que mal de su grado le hizo venir al suelo por
las ancas del caballo, dando tal caída, que, sin mover pie ni mano, dio
señales de que estaba muerto.
Apenas le vio caído Sancho, cuando se deslizó del alcornoque y a toda
priesa vino donde su señor estaba, el cual, apeándose de Rocinante, fue
sobre el de los Espejos, y, quitándole las lazadas del yelmo para ver si
era muerto y para que le diese el aire si acaso estaba vivo; y vio...
¿Quién podrá decir lo que vio, sin causar admiración, maravilla y espanto a
los que lo oyeren? Vio, dice la historia, el rostro mesmo, la misma figura,
el mesmo aspecto, la misma fisonomía, la mesma efigie, la pespetiva mesma
del bachiller Sansón Carrasco; y, así como la vio, en altas voces dijo:
— ¡Acude, Sancho, y mira lo que has de ver y no lo has creer! ¡Aguija, hijo,
y advierte lo que puede la magia, lo que pueden los hechiceros y los
encantadores!
Llegó Sancho, y, como vio el rostro del bachiller Carrasco, comenzó a
hacerse mil cruces y a santiguarse otras tantas. En todo esto, no daba
muestras de estar vivo el derribado caballero, y Sancho dijo a don Quijote:
— Soy de parecer, señor mío, que, por sí o por no, vuesa merced hinque y
meta la espada por la boca a este que parece el bachiller Sansón Carrasco;
quizá matará en él a alguno de sus enemigos los encantadores.
— No dices mal —dijo don Quijote—, porque de los enemigos, los menos.
Y, sacando la espada para poner en efecto el aviso y consejo de Sancho,
llegó el escudero del de los Espejos, ya sin las narices que tan feo le
habían hecho, y a grandes voces dijo:
— Mire vuesa merced lo que hace, señor don Quijote, que ese que tiene a los
pies es el bachiller Sansón Carrasco, su amigo, y yo soy su escudero.
Y, viéndole Sancho sin aquella fealdad primera, le dijo:
— ¿Y las narices?
A lo que él respondió:
— Aquí las tengo, en la faldriquera.
Y, echando mano a la derecha, sacó unas narices de pasta y barniz, de
máscara, de la manifatura que quedan delineadas. Y, mirándole más y más
Sancho, con voz admirativa y grande, dijo:
— ¡Santa María, y valme! ¿Éste no es Tomé Cecial, mi vecino y mi compadre?
— Y ¡cómo si lo soy! —respondió el ya desnarigado escudero—: Tomé Cecial
soy, compadre y amigo Sancho Panza, y luego os diré los arcaduces, embustes
y enredos por donde soy aquí venido; y en tanto, pedid y suplicad al señor
vuestro amo que no toque, maltrate, hiera ni mate al caballero de los
Espejos, que a sus pies tiene, porque sin duda alguna es el atrevido y mal
aconsejado del bachiller Sansón Carrasco, nuestro compatrioto.
En esto, volvió en sí el de los Espejos, lo cual visto por don Quijote, le
puso la punta desnuda de su espada encima del rostro, y le dijo:
— Muerto sois, caballero, si no confesáis que la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso
se aventaja en belleza a vuestra Casildea de Vandalia; y demás de esto
habéis de prometer, si de esta contienda y caída quedárades con vida, de ir
a la ciudad del Toboso y presentaros en su presencia de mi parte, para que
haga de vos lo que más en voluntad le viniere; y si os dejare en la
vuestra, asimismo habéis de volver a buscarme, que el rastro de mis hazañas
os servirá de guía que os traiga donde yo estuviere, y a decirme lo que con
ella hubiéredes pasado; condiciones que, conforme a las que pusimos antes
de nuestra batalla, no salen de los términos de la andante caballería.
— Confieso —dijo el caído caballero— que vale más el zapato descosido y
sucio de la señora Dulcinea del Toboso que las barbas mal peinadas, aunque
limpias, de Casildea, y prometo de ir y volver de su presencia a la
vuestra, y daros entera y particular cuenta de lo que me pedís.
— También habéis de confesar y creer —añadió don Quijote— que aquel
caballero que vencistes no fue ni pudo ser don Quijote de la Mancha, sino
otro que se le parecía, como yo confieso y creo que vos, aunque parecéis el
bachiller Sansón Carrasco, no lo sois, sino otro que le parece, y que en su
figura aquí me le han puesto mis enemigos, para que detenga y temple el
ímpetu de mi cólera, y para que use blandamente de la gloria del
vencimiento.
— Todo lo confieso, juzgo y siento como vos lo creéis, juzgáis y sentís
— respondió el derrengado caballero—. Dejadme levantar, os ruego, si es que
lo permite el golpe de mi caída, que asaz maltrecho me tiene.
Ayudóle a levantar don Quijote y Tomé Cecial, su escudero, del cual no
apartaba los ojos Sancho, preguntándole cosas cuyas respuestas le daban
manifiestas señales de que verdaderamente era el Tomé Cecial que decía; mas
la aprehensión que en Sancho había hecho lo que su amo dijo, de que los
encantadores habían mudado la figura del Caballero de los Espejos en la del
bachiller Carrasco, no le dejaba dar crédito a la verdad que con los ojos
estaba mirando. Finalmente, se quedaron con este engaño amo y mozo, y el de
los Espejos y su escudero, mohínos y malandantes, se apartaron de don
Quijote y Sancho, con intención de buscar algún lugar donde bizmarle y
entablarle las costillas. Don Quijote y Sancho volvieron a proseguir su
camino de Zaragoza, donde los deja la historia, por dar cuenta de quién era
el Caballero de los Espejos y su narigante escudero.
Capítulo XV. Donde se cuenta y da noticia de quién era el Caballero de los
Espejos y su escudero
En estremo contento, ufano y vanaglorioso iba don Quijote por haber
alcanzado vitoria de tan valiente caballero como él se imaginaba que era el
de los Espejos, de cuya caballeresca palabra esperaba saber si el
encantamento de su señora pasaba adelante, pues era forzoso que el tal
vencido caballero volviese, so pena de no serlo, a darle razón de lo que
con ella le hubiese sucedido. Pero uno pensaba don Quijote y otro el de los
Espejos, puesto que por entonces no era otro su pensamiento sino buscar
donde bizmarse, como se ha dicho.
Dice, pues, la historia que cuando el bachiller Sansón Carrasco aconsejó a
don Quijote que volviese a proseguir sus dejadas caballerías, fue por haber
entrado primero en bureo con el cura y el barbero sobre qué medio se podría
tomar para reducir a don Quijote a que se estuviese en su casa quieto y
sosegado, sin que le alborotasen sus mal buscadas aventuras; de cuyo
consejo salió, por voto común de todos y parecer particular de Carrasco,
que dejasen salir a don Quijote, pues el detenerle parecía imposible, y que
Sansón le saliese al camino como caballero andante, y trabase batalla con
él, pues no faltaría sobre qué, y le venciese, teniéndolo por cosa fácil, y
que fuese pacto y concierto que el vencido quedase a merced del vencedor; y
así vencido don Quijote, le había de mandar el bachiller caballero se
volviese a su pueblo y casa, y no saliese della en dos años, o hasta tanto
que por él le fuese mandado otra cosa; lo cual era claro que don Quijote
vencido cumpliría indubitablemente, por no contravenir y faltar a las leyes
de la caballería, y podría ser que en el tiempo de su reclusión se le
olvidasen sus vanidades, o se diese lugar de buscar a su locura algún
conveniente remedio.
Aceptólo Carrasco, y ofreciósele por escudero Tomé Cecial, compadre y
vecino de Sancho Panza, hombre alegre y de lucios cascos. Armóse Sansón
como queda referido y Tomé Cecial acomodó sobre sus naturales narices las
falsas y de máscara ya dichas, porque no fuese conocido de su compadre
cuando se viesen; y así, siguieron el mismo viaje que llevaba don Quijote,
y llegaron casi a hallarse en la aventura del carro de la Muerte. Y,
finalmente, dieron con ellos en el bosque, donde les sucedió todo lo que el
prudente ha leído; y si no fuera por los pensamientos extraordinarios de
don Quijote, que se dio a entender que el bachiller no era el bachiller, el
señor bachiller quedara imposibilitado para siempre de graduarse de
licenciado, por no haber hallado nidos donde pensó hallar pájaros.
Tomé Cecial, que vio cuán mal había logrado sus deseos y el mal paradero
que había tenido su camino, dijo al bachiller:
— Por cierto, señor Sansón Carrasco, que tenemos nuestro merecido: con
facilidad se piensa y se acomete una empresa, pero con dificultad las más
veces se sale della. Don Quijote loco, nosotros cuerdos: él se va sano y
riendo, vuesa merced queda molido y triste. Sepamos, pues, ahora, cuál es
más loco: ¿el que lo es por no poder menos, o el que lo es por su voluntad?
A lo que respondió Sansón:
— La diferencia que hay entre esos dos locos es que el que lo es por fuerza
lo será siempre, y el que lo es de grado lo dejará de ser cuando quisiere.
— Pues así es —dijo Tomé Cecial—, yo fui por mi voluntad loco cuando quise
hacerme escudero de vuestra merced, y por la misma quiero dejar de serlo y
volverme a mi casa.
— Eso os cumple —respondió Sansón—, porque pensar que yo he de volver a la
mía, hasta haber molido a palos a don Quijote, es pensar en lo escusado; y
no me llevará ahora a buscarle el deseo de que cobre su juicio, sino el de
la venganza; que el dolor grande de mis costillas no me deja hacer más
piadosos discursos.
En esto fueron razonando los dos, hasta que llegaron a un pueblo donde fue
ventura hallar un algebrista, con quien se curó el Sansón desgraciado. Tomé
Cecial se volvió y le dejó, y él quedó imaginando su venganza; y la
historia vuelve a hablar dél a su tiempo, por no dejar de regocijarse ahora
con don Quijote.
Capítulo XVI. De lo que sucedió a don Quijote con un discreto caballero de
la Mancha
Con la alegría, contento y ufanidad que se ha dicho, seguía don Quijote su
jornada, imaginándose por la pasada vitoria ser el caballero andante más
valiente que tenía en aquella edad el mundo; daba por acabadas y a felice
fin conducidas cuantas aventuras pudiesen sucederle de allí adelante; tenía
en poco a los encantos y a los encantadores; no se acordaba de los
inumerables palos que en el discurso de sus caballerías le habían dado, ni
de la pedrada que le derribó la mitad de los dientes, ni del
desagradecimiento de los galeotes, ni del atrevimiento y lluvia de estacas
de los yangüeses. Finalmente, decía entre sí que si él hallara arte, modo o
manera como desencantar a su señora Dulcinea, no invidiara a la mayor
ventura que alcanzó o pudo alcanzar el más venturoso caballero andante de
los pasados siglos. En estas imaginaciones iba todo ocupado, cuando Sancho
le dijo:
— ¿No es bueno, señor, que aun todavía traigo entre los ojos las desaforadas
narices, y mayores de marca, de mi compadre Tomé Cecial?
— Y ¿crees tú, Sancho, por ventura, que el Caballero de los Espejos era el
bachiller Carrasco; y su escudero, Tomé Cecial, tu compadre?
— No sé qué me diga a eso —respondió Sancho—; sólo sé que las señas que me
dio de mi casa, mujer y hijos no me las podría dar otro que él mesmo; y la
cara, quitadas las narices, era la misma de Tomé Cecial, como yo se la he
visto muchas veces en mi pueblo y pared en medio de mi misma casa; y el
tono de la habla era todo uno.
— Estemos a razón, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—. Ven acá: ¿en qué
consideración puede caber que el bachiller Sansón Carrasco viniese como
caballero andante, armado de armas ofensivas y defensivas, a pelear
conmigo? ¿He sido yo su enemigo por ventura? ¿Hele dado yo jamás ocasión
para tenerme ojeriza? ¿Soy yo su rival, o hace él profesión de las armas,
para tener invidia a la fama que yo por ellas he ganado?
— Pues, ¿qué diremos, señor —respondió Sancho—, a esto de parecerse tanto
aquel caballero, sea el que se fuere, al bachiller Carrasco, y su escudero
a Tomé Cecial, mi compadre? Y si ello es encantamento, como vuestra merced
ha dicho, ¿no había en el mundo otros dos a quien se parecieran?
— Todo es artificio y traza —respondió don Quijote— de los malignos magos
que me persiguen, los cuales, anteviendo que yo había de quedar vencedor en
la contienda, se previnieron de que el caballero vencido mostrase el rostro
de mi amigo el bachiller, porque la amistad que le tengo se pusiese entre
los filos de mi espada y el rigor de mi brazo, y templase la justa ira de
mi corazón, y desta manera quedase con vida el que con embelecos y falsías
procuraba quitarme la mía. Para prueba de lo cual ya sabes, ¡oh Sancho!,
por experiencia que no te dejará mentir ni engañar, cuán fácil sea a los
encantadores mudar unos rostros en otros, haciendo de lo hermoso feo y de
lo feo hermoso, pues no ha dos días que viste por tus mismos ojos la
hermosura y gallardía de la sin par Dulcinea en toda su entereza y natural
conformidad, y yo la vi en la fealdad y bajeza de una zafia labradora, con
cataratas en los ojos y con mal olor en la boca; y más, que el perverso
encantador que se atrevió a hacer una transformación tan mala no es mucho
que haya hecho la de Sansón Carrasco y la de tu compadre, por quitarme la
gloria del vencimiento de las manos. Pero, con todo esto, me consuelo;
porque, en fin, en cualquiera figura que haya sido, he quedado vencedor de
mi enemigo.
— Dios sabe la verdad de todo —respondió Sancho.
Y como él sabía que la transformación de Dulcinea había sido traza y
embeleco suyo, no le satisfacían las quimeras de su amo; pero no le quiso
replicar, por no decir alguna palabra que descubriese su embuste.
En estas razones estaban cuando los alcanzó un hombre que detrás dellos por
el mismo camino venía sobre una muy hermosa yegua tordilla, vestido un
gabán de paño fino verde, jironado de terciopelo leonado, con una montera
del mismo terciopelo; el aderezo de la yegua era de campo y de la jineta,
asimismo de morado y verde. Traía un alfanje morisco pendiente de un ancho
tahalí de verde y oro, y los borceguíes eran de la labor del tahalí; las
espuelas no eran doradas, sino dadas con un barniz verde, tan tersas y
bruñidas que, por hacer labor con todo el vestido, parecían mejor que si
fuera de oro puro. Cuando llegó a ellos, el caminante los saludó
cortésmente, y, picando a la yegua, se pasaba de largo; pero don Quijote le
dijo:
— Señor galán, si es que vuestra merced lleva el camino que nosotros y no
importa el darse priesa, merced recibiría en que nos fuésemos juntos.
— En verdad —respondió el de la yegua— que no me pasara tan de largo, si no
fuera por temor que con la compañía de mi yegua no se alborotara ese
caballo.
— Bien puede, señor —respondió a esta sazón Sancho—, bien puede tener las
riendas a su yegua, porque nuestro caballo es el más honesto y bien mirado
del mundo: jamás en semejantes ocasiones ha hecho vileza alguna, y una vez
que se desmandó a hacerla la lastamos mi señor y yo con las setenas. Digo
otra vez que puede vuestra merced detenerse, si quisiere; que, aunque se la
den entre dos platos, a buen seguro que el caballo no la arrostre.
Detuvo la rienda el caminante, admirándose de la apostura y rostro de don
Quijote, el cual iba sin celada, que la llevaba Sancho como maleta en el
arzón delantero de la albarda del rucio; y si mucho miraba el de lo verde a
don Quijote, mucho más miraba don Quijote al de lo verde, pareciéndole
hombre de chapa. La edad mostraba ser de cincuenta años; las canas, pocas,
y el rostro, aguileño; la vista, entre alegre y grave; finalmente, en el
traje y apostura daba a entender ser hombre de buenas prendas.
Lo que juzgó de don Quijote de la Mancha el de lo verde fue que semejante
manera ni parecer de hombre no le había visto jamás: admiróle la longura de
su caballo, la grandeza de su cuerpo, la flaqueza y amarillez de su rostro,
sus armas, su ademán y compostura: figura y retrato no visto por luengos
tiempos atrás en aquella tierra. Notó bien don Quijote la atención con que
el caminante le miraba, y leyóle en la suspensión su deseo; y, como era tan
cortés y tan amigo de dar gusto a todos, antes que le preguntase nada, le
salió al camino, diciéndole:
— Esta figura que vuesa merced en mí ha visto, por ser tan nueva y tan fuera
de las que comúnmente se usan, no me maravillaría yo de que le hubiese
maravillado; pero dejará vuesa merced de estarlo cuando le diga, como le
digo, que soy caballero
destos que dicen las gentes
que a sus aventuras van.
Salí de mi patria, empeñé mi hacienda, dejé mi regalo, y entreguéme en los
brazos de la Fortuna, que me llevasen donde más fuese servida. Quise
resucitar la ya muerta andante caballería, y ha muchos días que, tropezando
aquí, cayendo allí, despeñándome acá y levantándome acullá, he cumplido
gran parte de mi deseo, socorriendo viudas, amparando doncellas y
favoreciendo casadas, huérfanos y pupilos, propio y natural oficio de
caballeros andantes; y así, por mis valerosas, muchas y cristianas hazañas
he merecido andar ya en estampa en casi todas o las más naciones del mundo.
Treinta mil volúmenes se han impreso de mi historia, y lleva camino de
imprimirse treinta mil veces de millares, si el cielo no lo remedia.
Finalmente, por encerrarlo todo en breves palabras, o en una sola, digo que
yo soy don Quijote de la Mancha, por otro nombre llamado el Caballero de la
Triste Figura; y, puesto que las propias alabanzas envilecen, esme forzoso
decir yo tal vez las mías, y esto se entiende cuando no se halla presente
quien las diga; así que, señor gentilhombre, ni este caballo, esta lanza,
ni este escudo, ni escudero, ni todas juntas estas armas, ni la amarillez
de mi rostro, ni mi atenuada flaqueza, os podrá admirar de aquí adelante,
habiendo ya sabido quién soy y la profesión que hago.
Calló en diciendo esto don Quijote, y el de lo verde, según se tardaba en
responderle, parecía que no acertaba a hacerlo; pero de allí a buen espacio
le dijo:
— Acertastes, señor caballero, a conocer por mi suspensión mi deseo; pero no
habéis acertado a quitarme la maravilla que en mí causa el haberos visto;
que, puesto que, como vos, señor, decís, que el saber ya quién sois me lo
podría quitar, no ha sido así; antes, agora que lo sé, quedo más suspenso y
maravillado. ¿Cómo y es posible que hay hoy caballeros andantes en el
mundo, y que hay historias impresas de verdaderas caballerías? No me puedo
persuadir que haya hoy en la tierra quien favorezca viudas, ampare
doncellas, ni honre casadas, ni socorra huérfanos, y no lo creyera si en
vuesa merced no lo hubiera visto con mis ojos. ¡Bendito sea el cielo!, que
con esa historia, que vuesa merced dice que está impresa, de sus altas y
verdaderas caballerías, se habrán puesto en olvido las innumerables de los
fingidos caballeros andantes, de que estaba lleno el mundo, tan en daño de
las buenas costumbres y tan en perjuicio y descrédito de las buenas
historias.
— Hay mucho que decir —respondió don Quijote— en razón de si son fingidas, o
no, las historias de los andantes caballeros.
— Pues, ¿hay quien dude —respondió el Verde— que no son falsas las tales
historias?
— Yo lo dudo —respondió don Quijote—, y quédese esto aquí; que si nuestra
jornada dura, espero en Dios de dar a entender a vuesa merced que ha hecho
mal en irse con la corriente de los que tienen por cierto que no son
verdaderas.
Desta última razón de don Quijote tomó barruntos el caminante de que don
Quijote debía de ser algún mentecato, y aguardaba que con otras lo
confirmase; pero, antes que se divertiesen en otros razonamientos, don
Quijote le rogó le dijese quién era, pues él le había dado parte de su
condición y de su vida. A lo que respondió el del Verde Gabán:
— Yo, señor Caballero de la Triste Figura, soy un hidalgo natural de un
lugar donde iremos a comer hoy, si Dios fuere servido. Soy más que
medianamente rico y es mi nombre don Diego de Miranda; paso la vida con mi
mujer, y con mis hijos, y con mis amigos; mis ejercicios son el de la caza
y pesca, pero no mantengo ni halcón ni galgos, sino algún perdigón manso, o
algún hurón atrevido. Tengo hasta seis docenas de libros, cuáles de romance
y cuáles de latín, de historia algunos y de devoción otros; los de
caballerías aún no han entrado por los umbrales de mis puertas. Hojeo más
los que son profanos que los devotos, como sean de honesto entretenimiento,
que deleiten con el lenguaje y admiren y suspendan con la invención, puesto
que déstos hay muy pocos en España. Alguna vez como con mis vecinos y
amigos, y muchas veces los convido; son mis convites limpios y aseados, y
no nada escasos; ni gusto de murmurar, ni consiento que delante de mí se
murmure; no escudriño las vidas ajenas, ni soy lince de los hechos de los
otros; oigo misa cada día; reparto de mis bienes con los pobres, sin hacer
alarde de las buenas obras, por no dar entrada en mi corazón a la
hipocresía y vanagloria, enemigos que blandamente se apoderan del corazón
más recatado; procuro poner en paz los que sé que están desavenidos; soy
devoto de nuestra Señora, y confío siempre en la misericordia infinita de
Dios nuestro Señor.
Atentísimo estuvo Sancho a la relación de la vida y entretenimientos del
hidalgo; y, pareciéndole buena y santa y que quien la hacía debía de hacer
milagros, se arrojó del rucio, y con gran priesa le fue a asir del estribo
derecho, y con devoto corazón y casi lágrimas le besó los pies una y muchas
veces. Visto lo cual por el hidalgo, le preguntó:
— ¿Qué hacéis, hermano? ¿Qué besos son éstos?
— Déjenme besar —respondió Sancho—, porque me parece vuesa merced el primer
santo a la jineta que he visto en todos los días de mi vida.
— No soy santo —respondió el hidalgo—, sino gran pecador; vos sí, hermano,
que debéis de ser bueno, como vuestra simplicidad lo muestra.
Volvió Sancho a cobrar la albarda, habiendo sacado a plaza la risa de la
profunda malencolía de su amo y causado nueva admiración a don Diego.
Preguntóle don Quijote que cuántos hijos tenía, y díjole que una de las
cosas en que ponían el sumo bien los antiguos filósofos, que carecieron del
verdadero conocimiento de Dios, fue en los bienes de la naturaleza, en los
de la fortuna, en tener muchos amigos y en tener muchos y buenos hijos.
— Yo, señor don Quijote —respondió el hidalgo—, tengo un hijo, que, a no
tenerle, quizá me juzgara por más dichoso de lo que soy; y no porque él sea
malo, sino porque no es tan bueno como yo quisiera. Será de edad de diez y
ocho años: los seis ha estado en Salamanca, aprendiendo las lenguas latina
y griega; y, cuando quise que pasase a estudiar otras ciencias, halléle tan
embebido en la de la poesía, si es que se puede llamar ciencia, que no es
posible hacerle arrostrar la de las leyes, que yo quisiera que estudiara,
ni de la reina de todas, la teología. Quisiera yo que fuera corona de su
linaje, pues vivimos en siglo donde nuestros reyes premian altamente las
virtuosas y buenas letras; porque letras sin virtud son perlas en el
muladar. Todo el día se le pasa en averiguar si dijo bien o mal Homero en
tal verso de la Ilíada; si Marcial anduvo deshonesto, o no, en tal
epigrama; si se han de entender de una manera o otra tales y tales versos
de Virgilio. En fin, todas sus conversaciones son con los libros de los
referidos poetas, y con los de Horacio, Persio, Juvenal y Tibulo; que de
los modernos romancistas no hace mucha cuenta; y, con todo el mal cariño
que muestra tener a la poesía de romance, le tiene agora desvanecidos los
pensamientos el hacer una glosa a cuatro versos que le han enviado de
Salamanca, y pienso que son de justa literaria.
A todo lo cual respondió don Quijote:
— Los hijos, señor, son pedazos de las entrañas de sus padres, y así, se han
de querer, o buenos o malos que sean, como se quieren las almas que nos dan
vida; a los padres toca el encaminarlos desde pequeños por los pasos de la
virtud, de la buena crianza y de las buenas y cristianas costumbres, para
que cuando grandes sean báculo de la vejez de sus padres y gloria de su
posteridad; y en lo de forzarles que estudien esta o aquella ciencia no lo
tengo por acertado, aunque el persuadirles no será dañoso; y cuando no se
ha de estudiar para pane lucrando, siendo tan venturoso el estudiante que
le dio el cielo padres que se lo dejen, sería yo de parecer que le dejen
seguir aquella ciencia a que más le vieren inclinado; y, aunque la de la
poesía es menos útil que deleitable, no es de aquellas que suelen deshonrar
a quien las posee. La poesía, señor hidalgo, a mi parecer, es como una
doncella tierna y de poca edad, y en todo estremo hermosa, a quien tienen
cuidado de enriquecer, pulir y adornar otras muchas doncellas, que son
todas las otras ciencias, y ella se ha de servir de todas, y todas se han
de autorizar con ella; pero esta tal doncella no quiere ser manoseada, ni
traída por las calles, ni publicada por las esquinas de las plazas ni por
los rincones de los palacios. Ella es hecha de una alquimia de tal virtud,
que quien la sabe tratar la volverá en oro purísimo de inestimable precio;
hala de tener, el que la tuviere, a raya, no dejándola correr en torpes
sátiras ni en desalmados sonetos; no ha de ser vendible en ninguna manera,
si ya no fuere en poemas heroicos, en lamentables tragedias, o en comedias
alegres y artificiosas; no se ha de dejar tratar de los truhanes, ni del
ignorante vulgo, incapaz de conocer ni estimar los tesoros que en ella se
encierran. Y no penséis, señor, que yo llamo aquí vulgo solamente a la
gente plebeya y humilde; que todo aquel que no sabe, aunque sea señor y
príncipe, puede y debe entrar en número de vulgo. Y así, el que con los
requisitos que he dicho tratare y tuviere a la poesía, será famoso y
estimado su nombre en todas las naciones políticas del mundo. Y a lo que
decís, señor, que vuestro hijo no estima mucho la poesía de romance, doyme
a entender que no anda muy acertado en ello, y la razón es ésta: el grande
Homero no escribió en latín, porque era griego, ni Virgilio no escribió en
griego, porque era latino. En resolución, todos los poetas antiguos
escribieron en la lengua que mamaron en la leche, y no fueron a buscar las
estranjeras para declarar la alteza de sus conceptos. Y, siendo esto así,
razón sería se estendiese esta costumbre por todas las naciones, y que no
se desestimase el poeta alemán porque escribe en su lengua, ni el
castellano, ni aun el vizcaíno, que escribe en la suya. Pero vuestro hijo,
a lo que yo, señor, imagino, no debe de estar mal con la poesía de romance,
sino con los poetas que son meros romancistas, sin saber otras lenguas ni
otras ciencias que adornen y despierten y ayuden a su natural impulso; y
aun en esto puede haber yerro; porque, según es opinión verdadera, el poeta
nace: quieren decir que del vientre de su madre el poeta natural sale
poeta; y, con aquella inclinación que le dio el cielo, sin más estudio ni
artificio, compone cosas, que hace verdadero al que dijo: est Deus in
nobis..., etcétera. También digo que el natural poeta que se ayudare del
arte será mucho mejor y se aventajará al poeta que sólo por saber el arte
quisiere serlo; la razón es porque el arte no se aventaja a la naturaleza,
sino perficiónala; así que, mezcladas la naturaleza y el arte, y el arte
con la naturaleza, sacarán un perfetísimo poeta. Sea, pues, la conclusión
de mi plática, señor hidalgo, que vuesa merced deje caminar a su hijo por
donde su estrella le llama; que, siendo él tan buen estudiante como debe de
ser, y habiendo ya subido felicemente el primer escalón de las esencias,
que es el de las lenguas, con ellas por sí mesmo subirá a la cumbre de las
letras humanas, las cuales tan bien parecen en un caballero de capa y
espada, y así le adornan, honran y engrandecen, como las mitras a los
obispos, o como las garnachas a los peritos jurisconsultos. Riña vuesa
merced a su hijo si hiciere sátiras que perjudiquen las honras ajenas, y
castíguele, y rómpaselas, pero si hiciere sermones al modo de Horacio,
donde reprehenda los vicios en general, como tan elegantemente él lo hizo,
alábele: porque lícito es al poeta escribir contra la invidia, y decir en
sus versos mal de los invidiosos, y así de los otros vicios, con que no
señale persona alguna; pero hay poetas que, a trueco de decir una malicia,
se pondrán a peligro que los destierren a las islas de Ponto. Si el poeta
fuere casto en sus costumbres, lo será también en sus versos; la pluma es
lengua del alma: cuales fueren los conceptos que en ella se engendraren,
tales serán sus escritos; y cuando los reyes y príncipes veen la milagrosa
ciencia de la poesía en sujetos prudentes, virtuosos y graves, los honran,
los estiman y los enriquecen, y aun los coronan con las hojas del árbol a
quien no ofende el rayo, como en señal que no han de ser ofendidos de nadie
los que con tales coronas veen honrados y adornadas sus sienes.
Admirado quedó el del Verde Gabán del razonamiento de don Quijote, y tanto,
que fue perdiendo de la opinión que con él tenía, de ser mentecato. Pero, a
la mitad desta plática, Sancho, por no ser muy de su gusto, se había
desviado del camino a pedir un poco de leche a unos pastores que allí junto
estaban ordeñando unas ovejas; y, en esto, ya volvía a renovar la plática
el hidalgo, satisfecho en estremo de la discreción y buen discurso de don
Quijote, cuando, alzando don Quijote la cabeza, vio que por el camino por
donde ellos iban venía un carro lleno de banderas reales; y, creyendo que
debía de ser alguna nueva aventura, a grandes voces llamó a Sancho que
viniese a darle la celada. El cual Sancho, oyéndose llamar, dejó a los
pastores, y a toda priesa picó al rucio, y llegó donde su amo estaba, a
quien sucedió una espantosa y desatinada aventura.
Capítulo XVII. De donde se declaró el último punto y estremo adonde llegó y
pudo llegar el inaudito ánimo de don Quijote, con la felicemente acabada
aventura de los leones
Cuenta la historia que cuando don Quijote daba voces a Sancho que le
trujese el yelmo, estaba él comprando unos requesones que los pastores le
vendían; y, acosado de la mucha priesa de su amo, no supo qué hacer dellos,
ni en qué traerlos, y, por no perderlos, que ya los tenía pagados, acordó
de echarlos en la celada de su señor, y con este buen recado volvió a ver
lo que le quería; el cual, en llegando, le dijo:
— Dame, amigo, esa celada; que yo sé poco de aventuras, o lo que allí
descubro es alguna que me ha de necesitar, y me necesita, a tomar mis
armas.
El del Verde Gabán, que esto oyó, tendió la vista por todas partes, y no
descubrió otra cosa que un carro que hacia ellos venía, con dos o tres
banderas pequeñas, que le dieron a entender que el tal carro debía de traer
moneda de Su Majestad, y así se lo dijo a don Quijote; pero él no le dio
crédito, siempre creyendo y pensando que todo lo que le sucediese habían de
ser aventuras y más aventuras, y así, respondió al hidalgo:
— Hombre apercebido, medio combatido: no se pierde nada en que yo me
aperciba, que sé por experiencia que tengo enemigos visibles e invisibles,
y no sé cuándo, ni adónde, ni en qué tiempo, ni en qué figuras me han de
acometer.
Y, volviéndose a Sancho, le pidió la celada; el cual, como no tuvo lugar de
sacar los requesones, le fue forzoso dársela como estaba. Tomóla don
Quijote, y, sin que echase de ver lo que dentro venía, con toda priesa se
la encajó en la cabeza; y, como los requesones se apretaron y exprimieron,
comenzó a correr el suero por todo el rostro y barbas de don Quijote, de lo
que recibió tal susto, que dijo a Sancho:
— ¿Qué será esto, Sancho, que parece que se me ablandan los cascos, o se me
derriten los sesos, o que sudo de los pies a la cabeza? Y si es que sudo,
en verdad que no es de miedo; sin duda creo que es terrible la aventura que
agora quiere sucederme. Dame, si tienes, con que me limpie, que el copioso
sudor me ciega los ojos.
Calló Sancho y diole un paño, y dio con él gracias a Dios de que su señor
no hubiese caído en el caso. Limpióse don Quijote y quitóse la celada por
ver qué cosa era la que, a su parecer, le enfriaba la cabeza, y, viendo
aquellas gachas blancas dentro de la celada, las llegó a las narices, y en
oliéndolas dijo:
— Por vida de mi señora Dulcinea del Toboso, que son requesones los que aquí
me has puesto, traidor, bergante y mal mirado escudero.
A lo que, con gran flema y disimulación, respondió Sancho:
— Si son requesones, démelos vuesa merced, que yo me los comeré... Pero
cómalos el diablo, que debió de ser el que ahí los puso. ¿Yo había de tener
atrevimiento de ensuciar el yelmo de vuesa merced? ¡Hallado le habéis el
atrevido! A la fe, señor, a lo que Dios me da a entender, también debo yo
de tener encantadores que me persiguen como a hechura y miembro de vuesa
merced, y habrán puesto ahí esa inmundicia para mover a cólera su paciencia
y hacer que me muela, como suele, las costillas. Pues en verdad que esta
vez han dado salto en vago, que yo confío en el buen discurso de mi señor,
que habrá considerado que ni yo tengo requesones, ni leche, ni otra cosa
que lo valga, y que si la tuviera, antes la pusiera en mi estómago que en
la celada.
— Todo puede ser —dijo don Quijote.
Y todo lo miraba el hidalgo, y de todo se admiraba, especialmente cuando,
después de haberse limpiado don Quijote cabeza, rostro y barbas y celada,
se la encajó; y, afirmándose bien en los estribos, requiriendo la espada y
asiendo la lanza, dijo:
— Ahora, venga lo que veniere, que aquí estoy con ánimo de tomarme con el
mesmo Satanás en persona.
Llegó en esto el carro de las banderas, en el cual no venía otra gente que
el carretero, en las mulas, y un hombre sentado en la delantera. Púsose don
Quijote delante y dijo:
— ¿Adónde vais, hermanos? ¿Qué carro es éste, qué lleváis en él y qué
banderas son aquéstas?
A lo que respondió el carretero:
— El carro es mío; lo que va en él son dos bravos leones enjaulados, que el
general de Orán envía a la corte, presentados a Su Majestad; las banderas
son del rey nuestro señor, en señal que aquí va cosa suya.
— Y ¿son grandes los leones? —preguntó don Quijote.
— Tan grandes —respondió el hombre que iba a la puerta del carro—, que no
han pasado mayores, ni tan grandes, de Africa a España jamás; y yo soy el
leonero, y he pasado otros, pero como éstos, ninguno. Son hembra y macho;
el macho va en esta jaula primera, y la hembra en la de atrás; y ahora van
hambrientos porque no han comido hoy; y así, vuesa merced se desvíe, que es
menester llegar presto donde les demos de comer.
A lo que dijo don Quijote, sonriéndose un poco:
— ¿Leoncitos a mí? ¿A mí leoncitos, y a tales horas? Pues, ¡por Dios que han
de ver esos señores que acá los envían si soy yo hombre que se espanta de
leones! Apeaos, buen hombre, y, pues sois el leonero, abrid esas jaulas y
echadme esas bestias fuera, que en mitad desta campaña les daré a conocer
quién es don Quijote de la Mancha, a despecho y pesar de los encantadores
que a mí los envían.
— ¡Ta, ta! —dijo a esta sazón entre sí el hidalgo—, dado ha señal de quién
es nuestro buen caballero: los requesones, sin duda, le han ablandado los
cascos y madurado los sesos.
Llegóse en esto a él Sancho y díjole:
— Señor, por quien Dios es, que vuesa merced haga de manera que mi señor don
Quijote no se tome con estos leones, que si se toma, aquí nos han de hacer
pedazos a todos.
— Pues, ¿tan loco es vuestro amo —respondió el hidalgo—, que teméis, y
creéis que se ha de tomar con tan fieros animales?
— No es loco —respondió Sancho—, sino atrevido.
— Yo haré que no lo sea —replicó el hidalgo.
Y, llegándose a don Quijote, que estaba dando priesa al leonero que abriese
las jaulas, le dijo:
— Señor caballero, los caballeros andantes han de acometer las aventuras que
prometen esperanza de salir bien dellas, y no aquellas que de en todo la
quitan; porque la valentía que se entra en la juridición de la temeridad,
más tiene de locura que de fortaleza. Cuanto más, que estos leones no
vienen contra vuesa merced, ni lo sueñan: van presentados a Su Majestad, y
no será bien detenerlos ni impedirles su viaje.
— Váyase vuesa merced, señor hidalgo —respondió don Quijote—, a entender con
su perdigón manso y con su hurón atrevido, y deje a cada uno hacer su
oficio. Éste es el mío, y yo sé si vienen a mí, o no, estos señores leones.
Y, volviéndose al leonero, le dijo:
— ¡Voto a tal, don bellaco, que si no abrís luego luego las jaulas, que con
esta lanza os he de coser con el carro!
El carretero, que vio la determinación de aquella armada fantasía, le dijo:
— Señor mío, vuestra merced sea servido, por caridad, dejarme desuncir las
mulas y ponerme en salvo con ellas antes que se desenvainen los leones,
porque si me las matan, quedaré rematado para toda mi vida; que no tengo
otra hacienda sino este carro y estas mulas.
— ¡Oh hombre de poca fe! —respondió don Quijote—, apéate y desunce, y haz lo
que quisieres, que presto verás que trabajaste en vano y que pudieras
ahorrar desta diligencia.
Apeóse el carretero y desunció a gran priesa, y el leonero dijo a grandes
voces:
— Séanme testigos cuantos aquí están cómo contra mi voluntad y forzado abro
las jaulas y suelto los leones, y de que protesto a este señor que todo el
mal y daño que estas bestias hicieren corra y vaya por su cuenta, con más
mis salarios y derechos. Vuestras mercedes, señores, se pongan en cobro
antes que abra, que yo seguro estoy que no me han de hacer daño.
Otra vez le persuadió el hidalgo que no hiciese locura semejante, que era
tentar a Dios acometer tal disparate. A lo que respondió don Quijote que él
sabía lo que hacía. Respondióle el hidalgo que lo mirase bien, que él
entendía que se engañaba.
— Ahora, señor —replicó don Quijote—, si vuesa merced no quiere ser oyente
desta que a su parecer ha de ser tragedia, pique la tordilla y póngase en
salvo.
Oído lo cual por Sancho, con lágrimas en los ojos le suplicó desistiese de
tal empresa, en cuya comparación habían sido tortas y pan pintado la de los
molinos de viento y la temerosa de los batanes, y, finalmente, todas las
hazañas que había acometido en todo el discurso de su vida.
— Mire, señor —decía Sancho—, que aquí no hay encanto ni cosa que lo valga;
que yo he visto por entre las verjas y resquicios de la jaula una uña de
león verdadero, y saco por ella que el tal león, cuya debe de ser la tal
uña, es mayor que una montaña.
— El miedo, a lo menos —respondió don Quijote—, te le hará parecer mayor
que la mitad del mundo. Retírate, Sancho, y déjame; y si aquí muriere, ya
sabes nuestro antiguo concierto: acudirás a Dulcinea, y no te digo más.
A éstas añadió otras razones, con que quitó las esperanzas de que no había
de dejar de proseguir su desvariado intento. Quisiera el del Verde Gabán
oponérsele, pero viose desigual en las armas, y no le pareció cordura
tomarse con un loco, que ya se lo había parecido de todo punto don Quijote;
el cual, volviendo a dar priesa al leonero y a reiterar las amenazas, dio
ocasión al hidalgo a que picase la yegua, y Sancho al rucio, y el carretero
a sus mulas, procurando todos apartarse del carro lo más que pudiesen,
antes que los leones se desembanastasen.
Lloraba Sancho la muerte de su señor, que aquella vez sin duda creía que
llegaba en las garras de los leones; maldecía su ventura, y llamaba
menguada la hora en que le vino al pensamiento volver a servirle; pero no
por llorar y lamentarse dejaba de aporrear al rucio para que se alejase del
carro. Viendo, pues, el leonero que ya los que iban huyendo estaban bien
desviados, tornó a requerir y a intimar a don Quijote lo que ya le había
requerido e intimado, el cual respondió que lo oía, y que no se curase de
más intimaciones y requirimientos, que todo sería de poco fruto, y que se
diese priesa.
En el espacio que tardó el leonero en abrir la jaula primera, estuvo
considerando don Quijote si sería bien hacer la batalla antes a pie que a
caballo; y, en fin, se determinó de hacerla a pie, temiendo que Rocinante
se espantaría con la vista de los leones. Por esto saltó del caballo,
arrojó la lanza y embrazó el escudo, y, desenvainando la espada, paso ante
paso, con maravilloso denuedo y corazón valiente, se fue a poner delante
del carro, encomendándose a Dios de todo corazón, y luego a su señora
Dulcinea.
Y es de saber que, llegando a este paso, el autor de esta verdadera
historia exclama y dice: ''¡Oh fuerte y, sobre todo encarecimiento, animoso
don Quijote de la Mancha, espejo donde se pueden mirar todos los valientes
del mundo, segundo y nuevo don Manuel de León, que fue gloria y honra de
los españoles caballeros! ¿Con qué palabras contaré esta tan espantosa
hazaña, o con qué razones la haré creíble a los siglos venideros, o qué
alabanzas habrá que no te convengan y cuadren, aunque sean hipérboles sobre
todos los hipérboles? Tú a pie, tú solo, tú intrépido, tú magnánimo, con
sola una espada, y no de las del perrillo cortadoras, con un escudo no de
muy luciente y limpio acero, estás aguardando y atendiendo los dos más
fieros leones que jamás criaron las africanas selvas. Tus mismos hechos
sean los que te alaben, valeroso manchego, que yo los dejo aquí en su punto
por faltarme palabras con que encarecerlos''.
Aquí cesó la referida exclamación del autor, y pasó adelante, anudando el
hilo de la historia, diciendo que, visto el leonero ya puesto en postura a
don Quijote, y que no podía dejar de soltar al león macho, so pena de caer
en la desgracia del indignado y atrevido caballero, abrió de par en par la
primera jaula, donde estaba, como se ha dicho, el león, el cual pareció de
grandeza extraordinaria y de espantable y fea catadura. Lo primero que hizo
fue revolverse en la jaula, donde venía echado, y tender la garra, y
desperezarse todo; abrió luego la boca y bostezó muy despacio, y, con casi
dos palmos de lengua que sacó fuera, se despolvoreó los ojos y se lavó el
rostro; hecho esto, sacó la cabeza fuera de la jaula y miró a todas partes
con los ojos hechos brasas, vista y ademán para poner espanto a la misma
temeridad. Sólo don Quijote lo miraba atentamente, deseando que saltase ya
del carro y viniese con él a las manos, entre las cuales pensaba hacerle
pedazos.
Hasta aquí llegó el estremo de su jamás vista locura. Pero el generoso
león, más comedido que arrogante, no haciendo caso de niñerías, ni de
bravatas, después de haber mirado a una y otra parte, como se ha dicho,
volvió las espaldas y enseñó sus traseras partes a don Quijote, y con gran
flema y remanso se volvió a echar en la jaula. Viendo lo cual don Quijote,
mandó al leonero que le diese de palos y le irritase para echarle fuera.
— Eso no haré yo —respondió el leonero—, porque si yo le instigo, el primero
a quien hará pedazos será a mí mismo. Vuesa merced, señor caballero, se
contente con lo hecho, que es todo lo que puede decirse en género de
valentía, y no quiera tentar segunda fortuna. El león tiene abierta la
puerta: en su mano está salir, o no salir; pero, pues no ha salido hasta
ahora, no saldrá en todo el día. La grandeza del corazón de vuesa merced ya
está bien declarada: ningún bravo peleante, según a mí se me alcanza, está
obligado a más que a desafiar a su enemigo y esperarle en campaña; y si el
contrario no acude, en él se queda la infamia, y el esperante gana la
corona del vencimiento.
— Así es verdad —respondió don Quijote—: cierra, amigo, la puerta, y dame
por testimonio, en la mejor forma que pudieres, lo que aquí me has visto
hacer; conviene a saber: cómo tú abriste al león, yo le esperé, él no
salió; volvíle a esperar, volvió a no salir y volvióse acostar. No debo
más, y encantos afuera, y Dios ayude a la razón y a la verdad, y a la
verdadera caballería; y cierra, como he dicho, en tanto que hago señas a
los huidos y ausentes, para que sepan de tu boca esta hazaña.
Hízolo así el leonero, y don Quijote, poniendo en la punta de la lanza el
lienzo con que se había limpiado el rostro de la lluvia de los requesones,
comenzó a llamar a los que no dejaban de huir ni de volver la cabeza a cada
paso, todos en tropa y antecogidos del hidalgo; pero, alcanzando Sancho a
ver la señal del blanco paño, dijo:
— Que me maten si mi señor no ha vencido a las fieras bestias, pues nos
llama.
Detuviéronse todos, y conocieron que el que hacía las señas era don
Quijote; y, perdiendo alguna parte del miedo, poco a poco se vinieron
acercando hasta donde claramente oyeron las voces de don Quijote, que los
llamaba. Finalmente, volvieron al carro, y, en llegando, dijo don Quijote
al carretero:
— Volved, hermano, a uncir vuestras mulas y a proseguir vuestro viaje; y tú,
Sancho, dale dos escudos de oro, para él y para el leonero, en recompensa
de lo que por mí se han detenido.
— Ésos daré yo de muy buena gana —respondió Sancho—; pero, ¿qué se han hecho
los leones? ¿Son muertos, o vivos?
Entonces el leonero, menudamente y por sus pausas, contó el fin de la
contienda, exagerando, como él mejor pudo y supo, el valor de don Quijote,
de cuya vista el león, acobardado, no quiso ni osó salir de la jaula,
puesto que había tenido un buen espacio abierta la puerta de la jaula; y
que, por haber él dicho a aquel caballero que era tentar a Dios irritar al
león para que por fuerza saliese, como él quería que se irritase, mal de su
grado y contra toda su voluntad, había permitido que la puerta se cerrase.
— ¿Qué te parece desto, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote—. ¿Hay encantos que valgan
contra la verdadera valentía? Bien podrán los encantadores quitarme la
ventura, pero el esfuerzo y el ánimo, será imposible.
Dio los escudos Sancho, unció el carretero, besó las manos el leonero a don
Quijote por la merced recebida, y prometióle de contar aquella valerosa
hazaña al mismo rey, cuando en la corte se viese.
— Pues, si acaso Su Majestad preguntare quién la hizo, diréisle que el
Caballero de los Leones, que de aquí adelante quiero que en éste se
trueque, cambie, vuelva y mude el que hasta aquí he tenido del Caballero de
la Triste Figura; y en esto sigo la antigua usanza de los andantes
caballeros, que se mudaban los nombres cuando querían, o cuando les venía a
cuento.
Siguió su camino el carro, y don Quijote, Sancho y el del Verde Gabán
prosiguieron el suyo.
En todo este tiempo no había hablado palabra don Diego de Miranda, todo
atento a mirar y a notar los hechos y palabras de don Quijote, pareciéndole
que era un cuerdo loco y un loco que tiraba a cuerdo. No había aún llegado
a su noticia la primera parte de su historia; que si la hubiera leído,
cesara la admiración en que lo ponían sus hechos y sus palabras, pues ya
supiera el género de su locura; pero, como no la sabía, ya le tenía por
cuerdo y ya por loco, porque lo que hablaba era concertado, elegante y bien
dicho, y lo que hacía, disparatado, temerario y tonto. Y decía entre sí:
— ¿Qué más locura puede ser que ponerse la celada llena de requesones y
darse a entender que le ablandaban los cascos los encantadores? Y ¿qué
mayor temeridad y disparate que querer pelear por fuerza con leones?
Destas imaginaciones y deste soliloquio le sacó don Quijote, diciéndole:
— ¿Quién duda, señor don Diego de Miranda, que vuestra merced no me tenga en
su opinión por un hombre disparatado y loco? Y no sería mucho que así
fuese, porque mis obras no pueden dar testimonio de otra cosa. Pues, con
todo esto, quiero que vuestra merced advierta que no soy tan loco ni tan
menguado como debo de haberle parecido. Bien parece un gallardo caballero,
a los ojos de su rey, en la mitad de una gran plaza, dar una lanzada con
felice suceso a un bravo toro; bien parece un caballero, armado de
resplandecientes armas, pasar la tela en alegres justas delante de las
damas, y bien parecen todos aquellos caballeros que en ejercicios
militares, o que lo parezcan, entretienen y alegran, y, si se puede decir,
honran las cortes de sus príncipes; pero sobre todos éstos parece mejor un
caballero andante, que por los desiertos, por las soledades, por las
encrucijadas, por las selvas y por los montes anda buscando peligrosas
aventuras, con intención de darles dichosa y bien afortunada cima, sólo por
alcanzar gloriosa fama y duradera. Mejor parece, digo, un caballero
andante, socorriendo a una viuda en algún despoblado, que un cortesano
caballero, requebrando a una doncella en las ciudades. Todos los caballeros
tienen sus particulares ejercicios: sirva a las damas el cortesano;
autorice la corte de su rey con libreas; sustente los caballeros pobres con
el espléndido plato de su mesa; concierte justas, mantenga torneos y
muéstrese grande, liberal y magnífico, y buen cristiano, sobre todo, y
desta manera cumplirá con sus precisas obligaciones. Pero el andante
caballero busque los rincones del mundo; éntrese en los más intricados
laberintos; acometa a cada paso lo imposible; resista en los páramos
despoblados los ardientes rayos del sol en la mitad del verano, y en el
invierno la dura inclemencia de los vientos y de los yelos; no le asombren
leones, ni le espanten vestiglos, ni atemoricen endriagos; que buscar
éstos, acometer aquéllos y vencerlos a todos son sus principales y
verdaderos ejercicios. Yo, pues, como me cupo en suerte ser uno del número
de la andante caballería, no puedo dejar de acometer todo aquello que a mí
me pareciere que cae debajo de la juridición de mis ejercicios; y así, el
acometer los leones que ahora acometí derechamente me tocaba, puesto que
conocí ser temeridad esorbitante, porque bien sé lo que es valentía, que es
una virtud que está puesta entre dos estremos viciosos, como son la
cobardía y la temeridad; pero menos mal será que el que es valiente toque y
suba al punto de temerario, que no que baje y toque en el punto de cobarde;
que así como es más fácil venir el pródigo a ser liberal que al avaro, así
es más fácil dar el temerario en verdadero valiente que no el cobarde subir
a la verdadera valentía; y, en esto de acometer aventuras, créame vuesa
merced, señor don Diego, que antes se ha de perder por carta de más que de
menos, porque mejor suena en las orejas de los que lo oyen "el tal
caballero es temerario y atrevido" que no "el tal caballero es tímido y
cobarde".
— Digo, señor don Quijote —respondió don Diego—, que todo lo que vuesa
merced ha dicho y hecho va nivelado con el fiel de la misma razón, y que
entiendo que si las ordenanzas y leyes de la caballería andante se
perdiesen, se hallarían en el pecho de vuesa merced como en su mismo
depósito y archivo. Y démonos priesa, que se hace tarde, y lleguemos a mi
aldea y casa, donde descansará vuestra merced del pasado trabajo, que si no
ha sido del cuerpo, ha sido del espíritu, que suele tal vez redundar en
cansancio del cuerpo.
— Tengo el ofrecimiento a gran favor y merced, señor don Diego— respondió
don Quijote.
Y, picando más de lo que hasta entonces, serían como las dos de la tarde
cuando llegaron a la aldea y a la casa de don Diego, a quien don Quijote
llamaba el Caballero del Verde Gabán.
Capítulo XVIII. De lo que sucedió a don Quijote en el castillo o casa del
Caballero del Verde Gabán, con otras cosas extravagantes
Halló don Quijote ser la casa de don Diego de Miranda ancha como de aldea;
las armas, empero, aunque de piedra tosca, encima de la puerta de la calle;
la bodega, en el patio; la cueva, en el portal, y muchas tinajas a la
redonda, que, por ser del Toboso, le renovaron las memorias de su encantada
y transformada Dulcinea; y sospirando, y sin mirar lo que decía, ni delante
de quién estaba, dijo:
— ¡Oh dulces prendas, por mi mal halladas,
dulces y alegres cuando Dios quería!
¡Oh tobosescas tinajas, que me habéis traído a la memoria la dulce prenda
de mi mayor amargura!
Oyóle decir esto el estudiante poeta, hijo de don Diego, que con su madre
había salido a recebirle, y madre y hijo quedaron suspensos de ver la
estraña figura de don Quijote; el cual, apeándose de Rocinante, fue con
mucha cortesía a pedirle las manos para besárselas, y don Diego dijo:
— Recebid, señora, con vuestro sólito agrado al señor don Quijote de la
Mancha, que es el que tenéis delante, andante caballero y el más valiente y
el más discreto que tiene el mundo.
La señora, que doña Cristina se llamaba, le recibió con muestras de mucho
amor y de mucha cortesía, y don Quijote se le ofreció con asaz de discretas
y comedidas razones. Casi los mismos comedimientos pasó con el estudiante,
que, en oyéndole hablar don Quijote, le tuvo por discreto y agudo.
Aquí pinta el autor todas las circunstancias de la casa de don Diego,
pintándonos en ellas lo que contiene una casa de un caballero labrador y
rico; pero al traductor desta historia le pareció pasar estas y otras
semejantes menudencias en silencio, porque no venían bien con el propósito
principal de la historia, la cual más tiene su fuerza en la verdad que en
las frías digresiones.
Entraron a don Quijote en una sala, desarmóle Sancho, quedó en valones y en
jubón de camuza, todo bisunto con la mugre de las armas: el cuello era
valona a lo estudiantil, sin almidón y sin randas; los borceguíes eran
datilados, y encerados los zapatos. Ciñóse su buena espada, que pendía de
un tahalí de lobos marinos; que es opinión que muchos años fue enfermo de
los riñones; cubrióse un herreruelo de buen paño pardo; pero antes de todo,
con cinco calderos, o seis, de agua, que en la cantidad de los calderos hay
alguna diferencia, se lavó la cabeza y rostro, y todavía se quedó el agua
de color de suero, merced a la golosina de Sancho y a la compra de sus
negros requesones, que tan blanco pusieron a su amo. Con los referidos
atavíos, y con gentil donaire y gallardía, salió don Quijote a otra sala,
donde el estudiante le estaba esperando para entretenerle en tanto que las
mesas se ponían; que, por la venida de tan noble huésped, quería la señora
doña Cristina mostrar que sabía y podía regalar a los que a su casa
llegasen.
En tanto que don Quijote se estuvo desarmando, tuvo lugar don Lorenzo, que
así se llamaba el hijo de don Diego, de decir a su padre:
— ¿Quién diremos, señor, que es este caballero que vuesa merced nos ha
traído a casa? Que el nombre, la figura, y el decir que es caballero
andante, a mí y a mi madre nos tiene suspensos.
— No sé lo que te diga, hijo —respondió don Diego—; sólo te sabré decir que
le he visto hacer cosas del mayor loco del mundo, y decir razones tan
discretas que borran y deshacen sus hechos: háblale tú, y toma el pulso a
lo que sabe, y, pues eres discreto, juzga de su discreción o tontería lo
que más puesto en razón estuviere; aunque, para decir verdad, antes le
tengo por loco que por cuerdo.
Con esto, se fue don Lorenzo a entretener a don Quijote, como queda dicho,
y, entre otras pláticas que los dos pasaron, dijo don Quijote a don
Lorenzo:
— El señor don Diego de Miranda, padre de vuesa merced, me ha dado noticia
de la rara habilidad y sutil ingenio que vuestra merced tiene, y, sobre
todo, que es vuesa merced un gran poeta.
— Poeta, bien podrá ser —respondió don Lorenzo—, pero grande, ni por
pensamiento. Verdad es que yo soy algún tanto aficionado a la poesía y a
leer los buenos poetas, pero no de manera que se me pueda dar el nombre de
grande que mi padre dice.
— No me parece mal esa humildad —respondió don Quijote—, porque no hay poeta
que no sea arrogante y piense de sí que es el mayor poeta del mundo.
— No hay regla sin excepción —respondió don Lorenzo—, y alguno habrá que lo
sea y no lo piense.
— Pocos —respondió don Quijote—; pero dígame vuesa merced: ¿qué versos son
los que agora trae entre manos, que me ha dicho el señor su padre que le
traen algo inquieto y pensativo? Y si es alguna glosa, a mí se me entiende
algo de achaque de glosas, y holgaría saberlos; y si es que son de justa
literaria, procure vuestra merced llevar el segundo premio, que el primero
siempre se lleva el favor o la gran calidad de la persona, el segundo se le
lleva la mera justicia, y el tercero viene a ser segundo, y el primero, a
esta cuenta, será el tercero, al modo de las licencias que se dan en las
universidades; pero, con todo esto, gran personaje es el nombre de primero.
— Hasta ahora —dijo entre sí don Lorenzo—, no os podré yo juzgar por loco;
vamos adelante.
Y díjole:
— Paréceme que vuesa merced ha cursado las escuelas: ¿qué ciencias ha oído?
— La de la caballería andante —respondió don Quijote—, que es tan buena como
la de la poesía, y aun dos deditos más.
— No sé qué ciencia sea ésa —replicó don Lorenzo—, y hasta ahora no ha
llegado a mi noticia.
— Es una ciencia —replicó don Quijote— que encierra en sí todas o las más
ciencias del mundo, a causa que el que la profesa ha de ser jurisperito, y
saber las leyes de la justicia distributiva y comutativa, para dar a cada
uno lo que es suyo y lo que le conviene; ha de ser teólogo, para saber dar
razón de la cristiana ley que profesa, clara y distintamente, adondequiera
que le fuere pedido; ha de ser médico y principalmente herbolario, para
conocer en mitad de los despoblados y desiertos las yerbas que tienen
virtud de sanar las heridas, que no ha de andar el caballero andante a cada
triquete buscando quien se las cure; ha de ser astrólogo, para conocer por
las estrellas cuántas horas son pasadas de la noche, y en qué parte y en
qué clima del mundo se halla; ha de saber las matemáticas, porque a cada
paso se le ofrecerá tener necesidad dellas; y, dejando aparte que ha de
estar adornado de todas las virtudes teologales y cardinales, decendiendo a
otras menudencias, digo que ha de saber nadar como dicen que nadaba el peje
Nicolás o Nicolao; ha de saber herrar un caballo y aderezar la silla y el
freno; y, volviendo a lo de arriba, ha de guardar la fe a Dios y a su dama;
ha de ser casto en los pensamientos, honesto en las palabras, liberal en
las obras, valiente en los hechos, sufrido en los trabajos, caritativo con
los menesterosos, y, finalmente, mantenedor de la verdad, aunque le cueste
la vida el defenderla. De todas estas grandes y mínimas partes se compone
un buen caballero andante; porque vea vuesa merced, señor don Lorenzo, si
es ciencia mocosa lo que aprende el caballero que la estudia y la profesa,
y si se puede igualar a las más estiradas que en los ginasios y escuelas se
enseñan.
— Si eso es así —replicó don Lorenzo—, yo digo que se aventaja esa ciencia a
todas.
— ¿Cómo si es así? —respondió don Quijote.
Lo que yo quiero decir —dijo don Lorenzo— es que dudo que haya habido, ni
que los hay ahora, caballeros andantes y adornados de virtudes tantas.
— Muchas veces he dicho lo que vuelvo a decir ahora —respondió don Quijote—:
que la mayor parte de la gente del mundo está de parecer de que no ha
habido en él caballeros andantes; y, por parecerme a mí que si el cielo
milagrosamente no les da a entender la verdad de que los hubo y de que los
hay, cualquier trabajo que se tome ha de ser en vano, como muchas veces me
lo ha mostrado la experiencia, no quiero detenerme agora en sacar a vuesa
merced del error que con los muchos tiene; lo que pienso hacer es el rogar
al cielo le saque dél, y le dé a entender cuán provechosos y cuán
necesarios fueron al mundo los caballeros andantes en los pasados siglos, y
cuán útiles fueran en el presente si se usaran; pero triunfan ahora, por
pecados de las gentes, la pereza, la ociosidad, la gula y el regalo.
— Escapado se nos ha nuestro huésped —dijo a esta sazón entre sí don
Lorenzo—, pero, con todo eso, él es loco bizarro, y yo sería mentecato
flojo si así no lo creyese.
Aquí dieron fin a su plática, porque los llamaron a comer. Preguntó don
Diego a su hijo qué había sacado en limpio del ingenio del huésped. A lo
que él respondió:
— No le sacarán del borrador de su locura cuantos médicos y buenos
escribanos tiene el mundo: él es un entreverado loco, lleno de lúcidos
intervalos.
Fuéronse a comer, y la comida fue tal como don Diego había dicho en el
camino que la solía dar a sus convidados: limpia, abundante y sabrosa; pero
de lo que más se contentó don Quijote fue del maravilloso silencio que en
toda la casa había, que semejaba un monasterio de cartujos. Levantados,
pues, los manteles, y dadas gracias a Dios y agua a las manos, don
Quijote pidió ahincadamente a don Lorenzo dijese los versos de la justa
literaria; a lo que él respondió que, por no parecer de aquellos poetas que
cuando les ruegan digan sus versos los niegan y cuando no se los piden los
vomitan,...
— ...yo diré mi glosa, de la cual no espero premio alguno, que sólo por
ejercitar el ingenio la he hecho.
— Un amigo y discreto —respondió don Quijote— era de parecer que no se había
de cansar nadie en glosar versos; y la razón, decía él, era que jamás la
glosa podía llegar al texto, y que muchas o las más veces iba la glosa
fuera de la intención y propósito de lo que pedía lo que se glosaba; y más,
que las leyes de la glosa eran demasiadamente estrechas: que no sufrían
interrogantes, ni dijo, ni diré, ni hacer nombres de verbos, ni mudar el
sentido, con otras ataduras y estrechezas con que van atados los que
glosan, como vuestra merced debe de saber.
— Verdaderamente, señor don Quijote —dijo don Lorenzo—, que deseo coger a
vuestra merced en un mal latín continuado, y no puedo, porque se me desliza
de entre las manos como anguila.
— No entiendo —respondió don Quijote— lo que vuestra merced dice ni quiere
decir en eso del deslizarme.
— Yo me daré a entender —respondió don Lorenzo—; y por ahora esté vuesa
merced atento a los versos glosados y a la glosa, que dicen desta manera:
¡Si mi fue tornase a es,
sin esperar más será,
o viniese el tiempo ya
de lo que será después...!
Glosa
Al fin, como todo pasa,
se pasó el bien que me dio
Fortuna, un tiempo no escasa,
y nunca me le volvió,
ni abundante, ni por tasa.
Siglos ha ya que me vees,
Fortuna, puesto a tus pies;
vuélveme a ser venturoso,
que será mi ser dichoso
si mi fue tornase a es.
No quiero otro gusto o gloria,
otra palma o vencimiento,
otro triunfo, otra vitoria,
sino volver al contento
que es pesar en mi memoria.
Si tú me vuelves allá,
Fortuna, templado está
todo el rigor de mi fuego,
y más si este bien es luego,
sin esperar más será.
Cosas imposibles pido,
pues volver el tiempo a ser
después que una vez ha sido,
no hay en la tierra poder
que a tanto se haya estendido.
Corre el tiempo, vuela y va
ligero, y no volverá,
y erraría el que pidiese,
o que el tiempo ya se fuese,
o volviese el tiempo ya.
Vivo en perpleja vida,
ya esperando, ya temiendo:
es muerte muy conocida,
y es mucho mejor muriendo
buscar al dolor salida.
A mí me fuera interés
acabar, mas no lo es,
pues, con discurso mejor,
me da la vida el temor
de lo que será después.
En acabando de decir su glosa don Lorenzo, se levantó en pie don Quijote,
y, en voz levantada, que parecía grito, asiendo con su mano la derecha de
don Lorenzo, dijo:
— ¡Viven los cielos donde más altos están, mancebo generoso, que sois el
mejor poeta del orbe, y que merecéis estar laureado, no por Chipre ni por
Gaeta, como dijo un poeta, que Dios perdone, sino por las academias de
Atenas, si hoy vivieran, y por las que hoy viven de París, Bolonia y
Salamanca! Plega al cielo que los jueces que os quitaren el premio primero,
Febo los asaetee y las Musas jamás atraviesen los umbrales de sus casas.
Decidme, señor, si sois servido, algunos versos mayores, que quiero tomar
de todo en todo el pulso a vuestro admirable ingenio.
¿No es bueno que dicen que se holgó don Lorenzo de verse alabar de don
Quijote, aunque le tenía por loco? ¡Oh fuerza de la adulación, a cuánto te
estiendes, y cuán dilatados límites son los de tu juridición agradable!
Esta verdad acreditó don Lorenzo, pues concedió con la demanda y deseo de
don Quijote, diciéndole este soneto a la fábula o historia de Píramo y
Tisbe:
Soneto
El muro rompe la doncella hermosa
que de Píramo abrió el gallardo pecho:
parte el Amor de Chipre, y va derecho
a ver la quiebra estrecha y prodigiosa.
Habla el silencio allí, porque no osa
la voz entrar por tan estrecho estrecho;
las almas sí, que amor suele de hecho
facilitar la más difícil cosa.
Salió el deseo de compás, y el paso
de la imprudente virgen solicita
por su gusto su muerte; ved qué historia:
que a entrambos en un punto, ¡oh estraño caso!,
los mata, los encubre y resucita
una espada, un sepulcro, una memoria.
— ¡Bendito sea Dios! —dijo don Quijote habiendo oído el soneto a don
Lorenzo—, que entre los infinitos poetas consumidos que hay, he visto un
consumado poeta, como lo es vuesa merced, señor mío; que así me lo da a
entender el artificio deste soneto.
Cuatro días estuvo don Quijote regaladísimo en la casa de don Diego, al
cabo de los cuales le pidió licencia para irse, diciéndole que le agradecía
la merced y buen tratamiento que en su casa había recebido; pero que, por
no parecer bien que los caballeros andantes se den muchas horas a ocio y al
regalo, se quería ir a cumplir con su oficio, buscando las aventuras, de
quien tenía noticia que aquella tierra abundaba, donde esperaba entretener
el tiempo hasta que llegase el día de las justas de Zaragoza, que era el de
su derecha derrota; y que primero había de entrar en la cueva de
Montesinos, de quien tantas y tan admirables cosas en aquellos contornos se
contaban, sabiendo e inquiriendo asimismo el nacimiento y verdaderos
manantiales de las siete lagunas llamadas comúnmente de Ruidera.
Don Diego y su hijo le alabaron su honrosa determinación, y le dijeron que
tomase de su casa y de su hacienda todo lo que en grado le viniese, que le
servirían con la voluntad posible; que a ello les obligaba el valor de su
persona y la honrosa profesión suya.
Llegóse, en fin, el día de su partida, tan alegre para don Quijote como
triste y aciago para Sancho Panza, que se hallaba muy bien con la
abundancia de la casa de don Diego, y rehusaba de volver a la hambre que se
usa en las florestas, despoblados, y a la estrecheza de sus mal proveídas
alforjas. Con todo esto, las llenó y colmó de lo más necesario que le
pareció; y al despedirse dijo don Quijote a don Lorenzo:
— No sé si he dicho a vuesa merced otra vez, y si lo he dicho lo vuelvo a
decir, que cuando vuesa merced quisiere ahorrar caminos y trabajos para
llegar a la inacesible cumbre del templo de la Fama, no tiene que hacer
otra cosa sino dejar a una parte la senda de la poesía, algo estrecha, y
tomar la estrechísima de la andante caballería, bastante para hacerle
emperador en daca las pajas.
Con estas razones acabó don Quijote de cerrar el proceso de su locura, y
más con las que añadió, diciendo:
— Sabe Dios si quisiera llevar conmigo al señor don Lorenzo, para enseñarle
cómo se han de perdonar los sujetos, y supeditar y acocear los soberbios,
virtudes anejas a la profesión que yo profeso; pero, pues no lo pide su
poca edad, ni lo querrán consentir sus loables ejercicios, sólo me contento
con advertirle a vuesa merced que, siendo poeta, podrá ser famoso si se
guía más por el parecer ajeno que por el propio, porque no hay padre ni
madre a quien sus hijos le parezcan feos, y en los que lo son del
entendimiento corre más este engaño.
De nuevo se admiraron padre y hijo de las entremetidas razones de don
Quijote, ya discretas y ya disparatadas, y del tema y tesón que llevaba de
acudir de todo en todo a la busca de sus desventuradas aventuras, que las
tenía por fin y blanco de sus deseos. Reiteráronse los ofrecimientos y
comedimientos, y, con la buena licencia de la señora del castillo, don
Quijote y Sancho, sobre Rocinante y el rucio, se partieron.
Capítulo XIX. Donde se cuenta la aventura del pastor enamorado, con otros
en verdad graciosos sucesos
Poco trecho se había alongado don Quijote del lugar de don Diego, cuando
encontró con dos como clérigos o como estudiantes y con dos labradores que
sobre cuatro bestias asnales venían caballeros. El uno de los estudiantes
traía, como en portamanteo, en un lienzo de bocací verde envuelto, al
parecer, un poco de grana blanca y dos pares de medias de cordellate; el
otro no traía otra cosa que dos espadas negras de esgrima, nuevas, y con
sus zapatillas. Los labradores traían otras cosas, que daban indicio y
señal que venían de alguna villa grande, donde las habían comprado, y las
llevaban a su aldea; y así estudiantes como labradores cayeron en la misma
admiración en que caían todos aquellos que la vez primera veían a don
Quijote, y morían por saber qué hombre fuese aquél tan fuera del uso de los
otros hombres.
Saludóles don Quijote, y, después de saber el camino que llevaban, que era
el mesmo que él hacía, les ofreció su compañía, y les pidió detuviesen el
paso, porque caminaban más sus pollinas que su caballo; y, para obligarlos,
en breves razones les dijo quién era, y su oficio y profesión, que era de
caballero andante que iba a buscar las aventuras por todas las partes del
mundo. Díjoles que se llamaba de nombre propio don Quijote de la Mancha, y
por el apelativo, el Caballero de los Leones. Todo esto para los labradores
era hablarles en griego o en jerigonza, pero no para los estudiantes, que
luego entendieron la flaqueza del celebro de don Quijote; pero, con todo
eso, le miraban con admiración y con respecto, y uno dellos le dijo:
— Si vuestra merced, señor caballero, no lleva camino determinado, como no
le suelen llevar los que buscan las aventuras, vuesa merced se venga con
nosotros: verá una de las mejores bodas y más ricas que hasta el día de hoy
se habrán celebrado en la Mancha, ni en otras muchas leguas a la redonda.
Preguntóle don Quijote si eran de algún príncipe, que así las ponderaba.
— No son —respondió el estudiante— sino de un labrador y una labradora: él,
el más rico de toda esta tierra; y ella, la más hermosa que han visto los
hombres. El aparato con que se han de hacer es estraordinario y nuevo,
porque se han de celebrar en un prado que está junto al pueblo de la novia,
a quien por excelencia llaman Quiteria la hermosa, y el desposado se llama
Camacho el rico; ella de edad de diez y ocho años, y él de veinte y dos;
ambos para en uno, aunque algunos curiosos que tienen de memoria los
linajes de todo el mundo quieren decir que el de la hermosa Quiteria se
aventaja al de Camacho; pero ya no se mira en esto, que las riquezas son
poderosas de soldar muchas quiebras. En efecto, el tal Camacho es liberal y
hásele antojado de enramar y cubrir todo el prado por arriba, de tal suerte
que el sol se ha de ver en trabajo si quiere entrar a visitar las yerbas
verdes de que está cubierto el suelo. Tiene asimesmo maheridas danzas, así
de espadas como de cascabel menudo, que hay en su pueblo quien los repique
y sacuda por estremo; de zapateadores no digo nada, que es un juicio los
que tiene muñidos; pero ninguna de las cosas referidas ni otras muchas que
he dejado de referir ha de hacer más memorables estas bodas, sino las que
imagino que hará en ellas el despechado Basilio. Es este Basilio un zagal
vecino del mesmo lugar de Quiteria, el cual tenía su casa pared y medio de
la de los padres de Quiteria, de donde tomó ocasión el amor de renovar al
mundo los ya olvidados amores de Píramo y Tisbe, porque Basilio se enamoró
de Quiteria desde sus tiernos y primeros años, y ella fue correspondiendo a
su deseo con mil honestos favores, tanto, que se contaban por
entretenimiento en el pueblo los amores de los dos niños Basilio y
Quiteria. Fue creciendo la edad, y acordó el padre de Quiteria de estorbar
a Basilio la ordinaria entrada que en su casa tenía; y, por quitarse de
andar receloso y lleno de sospechas, ordenó de casar a su hija con el rico
Camacho, no pareciéndole ser bien casarla con Basilio, que no tenía tantos
bienes de fortuna como de naturaleza; pues si va a decir las verdades sin
invidia, él es el más ágil mancebo que conocemos: gran tirador de barra,
luchador estremado y gran jugador de pelota; corre como un gamo, salta más
que una cabra y birla a los bolos como por encantamento; canta como una
calandria, y toca una guitarra, que la hace hablar, y, sobre todo, juega
una espada como el más pintado.
— Por esa sola gracia —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, merecía ese mancebo
no sólo casarse con la hermosa Quiteria, sino con la mesma reina Ginebra,
si fuera hoy viva, a pesar de Lanzarote y de todos aquellos que estorbarlo
quisieran.
— ¡A mi mujer con eso! —dijo Sancho Panza, que hasta entonces había ido
callando y escuchando—, la cual no quiere sino que cada uno case con su
igual, ateniéndose al refrán que dicen "cada oveja con su pareja". Lo que
yo quisiera es que ese buen Basilio, que ya me le voy aficionando, se
casara con esa señora Quiteria; que buen siglo hayan y buen poso, iba a
decir al revés, los que estorban que se casen los que bien se quieren.
— Si todos los que bien se quieren se hubiesen de casar —dijo don Quijote—,
quitaríase la eleción y juridición a los padres de casar sus hijos con
quien y cuando deben; y si a la voluntad de las hijas quedase escoger los
maridos, tal habría que escogiese al criado de su padre, y tal al que vio
pasar por la calle, a su parecer, bizarro y entonado, aunque fuese un
desbaratado espadachín; que el amor y la afición con facilidad ciegan los
ojos del entendimiento, tan necesarios para escoger estado, y el del
matrimonio está muy a peligro de errarse, y es menester gran tiento y
particular favor del cielo para acertarle. Quiere hacer uno un viaje largo,
y si es prudente, antes de ponerse en camino busca alguna compañía segura y
apacible con quien acompañarse; pues, ¿por qué no hará lo mesmo el que ha
de caminar toda la vida, hasta el paradero de la muerte, y más si la
compañía le ha de acompañar en la cama, en la mesa y en todas partes, como
es la de la mujer con su marido? La de la propia mujer no es mercaduría que
una vez comprada se vuelve, o se trueca o cambia, porque es accidente
inseparable, que dura lo que dura la vida: es un lazo que si una vez le
echáis al cuello, se vuelve en el nudo gordiano, que si no le corta la
guadaña de la muerte, no hay desatarle. Muchas más cosas pudiera decir en
esta materia, si no lo estorbara el deseo que tengo de saber si le queda
más que decir al señor licenciado acerca de la historia de Basilio.
A lo que respondió el estudiante bachiller, o licenciado, como le llamó don
Quijote, que:
— De todo no me queda más que decir sino que desde el punto que Basilio supo
que la hermosa Quiteria se casaba con Camacho el rico, nunca más le han
visto reír ni hablar razón concertada, y siempre anda pensativo y triste,
hablando entre sí mismo, con que da ciertas y claras señales de que se le
ha vuelto el juicio: come poco y duerme poco, y lo que come son frutas, y
en lo que duerme, si duerme, es en el campo, sobre la dura tierra, como
animal bruto; mira de cuando en cuando al cielo, y otras veces clava los
ojos en la tierra, con tal embelesamiento, que no parece sino estatua
vestida que el aire le mueve la ropa. En fin, él da tales muestras de tener
apasionado el corazón, que tememos todos los que le conocemos que el dar el
sí mañana la hermosa Quiteria ha de ser la sentencia de su muerte.
— Dios lo hará mejor —dijo Sancho—; que Dios, que da la llaga, da la
medicina; nadie sabe lo que está por venir: de aquí a mañana muchas horas
hay, y en una, y aun en un momento, se cae la casa; yo he visto llover y
hacer sol, todo a un mesmo punto; tal se acuesta sano la noche, que no se
puede mover otro día. Y díganme, ¿por ventura habrá quien se alabe que
tiene echado un clavo a la rodaja de la Fortuna? No, por cierto; y entre el
sí y el no de la mujer no me atrevería yo a poner una punta de alfiler,
porque no cabría. Denme a mí que Quiteria quiera de buen corazón y de buena
voluntad a Basilio, que yo le daré a él un saco de buena ventura: que el
amor, según yo he oído decir, mira con unos antojos que hacen parecer oro
al cobre, a la pobreza riqueza, y a las lagañas perlas.
— ¿Adónde vas a parar, Sancho, que seas maldito? —dijo don Quijote—; que
cuando comienzas a ensartar refranes y cuentos, no te puede esperar sino el
mesmo Judas, que te lleve. Dime, animal, ¿qué sabes tú de clavos, ni de
rodajas, ni de otra cosa ninguna?
— ¡Oh! Pues si no me entienden —respondió Sancho—, no es maravilla que mis
sentencias sean tenidas por disparates. Pero no importa: yo me entiendo, y
sé que no he dicho muchas necedades en lo que he dicho; sino que vuesa
merced, señor mío, siempre es friscal de mis dichos, y aun de mis hechos.
— Fiscal has de decir —dijo don Quijote—, que no friscal, prevaricador del
buen lenguaje, que Dios te confunda.
— No se apunte vuestra merced conmigo —respondió Sancho—, pues sabe que no
me he criado en la Corte, ni he estudiado en Salamanca, para saber si añado
o quito alguna letra a mis vocablos. Sí, que, ¡válgame Dios!, no hay para
qué obligar al sayagués a que hable como el toledano, y toledanos puede
haber que no las corten en el aire en esto del hablar polido.
— Así es —dijo el licenciado—, porque no pueden hablar tan bien los que se
crían en las Tenerías y en Zocodover como los que se pasean casi todo el
día por el claustro de la Iglesia Mayor, y todos son toledanos. El lenguaje
puro, el propio, el elegante y claro, está en los discretos cortesanos,
aunque hayan nacido en Majalahonda: dije discretos porque hay muchos que no
lo son, y la discreción es la gramática del buen lenguaje, que se acompaña
con el uso. Yo, señores, por mis pecados, he estudiado Cánones en
Salamanca, y pícome algún tanto de decir mi razón con palabras claras,
llanas y significantes.
— Si no os picáredes más de saber más menear las negras que lleváis que la
lengua —dijo el otro estudiante—, vos llevárades el primero en licencias,
como llevastes cola.
— Mirad, bachiller —respondió el licenciado—: vos estáis en la más errada
opinión del mundo acerca de la destreza de la espada, teniéndola por vana.
— Para mí no es opinión, sino verdad asentada —replicó Corchuelo—; y si
queréis que os lo muestre con la experiencia, espadas traéis, comodidad
hay, yo pulsos y fuerzas tengo, que acompañadas de mi ánimo, que no es
poco, os harán confesar que yo no me engaño. Apeaos, y usad de vuestro
compás de pies, de vuestros círculos y vuestros ángulos y ciencia; que yo
espero de haceros ver estrellas a mediodía con mi destreza moderna y zafia,
en quien espero, después de Dios, que está por nacer hombre que me haga
volver las espaldas, y que no le hay en el mundo a quien yo no le haga
perder tierra.
— En eso de volver, o no, las espaldas no me meto —replico el diestro—;
aunque podría ser que en la parte donde la vez primera clavásedes el pie,
allí os abriesen la sepultura: quiero decir que allí quedásedes muerto por
la despreciada destreza.
— Ahora se verá —respondió Corchuelo.
Y, apeándose con gran presteza de su jumento, tiró con furia de una de las
espadas que llevaba el licenciado en el suyo.
— No ha de ser así —dijo a este instante don Quijote—, que yo quiero ser el
maestro desta esgrima, y el juez desta muchas veces no averiguada cuestión.
Y, apeándose de Rocinante y asiendo de su lanza, se puso en la mitad del
camino, a tiempo que ya el licenciado, con gentil donaire de cuerpo y
compás de pies, se iba contra Corchuelo, que contra él se vino, lanzando,
como decirse suele, fuego por los ojos. Los otros dos labradores del
acompañamiento, sin apearse de sus pollinas, sirvieron de aspetatores en la
mortal tragedia. Las cuchilladas, estocadas, altibajos, reveses y mandobles
que tiraba Corchuelo eran sin número, más espesas que hígado y más menudas
que granizo. Arremetía como un león irritado, pero salíale al encuentro un
tapaboca de la zapatilla de la espada del licenciado, que en mitad de su
furia le detenía, y se la hacía besar como si fuera reliquia, aunque no con
tanta devoción como las reliquias deben y suelen besarse.
Finalmente, el licenciado le contó a estocadas todos los botones de una
media sotanilla que traía vestida, haciéndole tiras los faldamentos, como
colas de pulpo; derribóle el sombrero dos veces, y cansóle de manera que de
despecho, cólera y rabia asió la espada por la empuñadura, y arrojóla por
el aire con tanta fuerza, que uno de los labradores asistentes, que era
escribano, que fue por ella, dio después por testimonio que la alongó de sí
casi tres cuartos de legua; el cual testimonio sirve y ha servido para que
se conozca y vea con toda verdad cómo la fuerza es vencida del arte.
Sentóse cansado Corchuelo, y llegándose a él Sancho, le dijo:
— Mía fe, señor bachiller, si vuesa merced toma mi consejo, de aquí adelante
no ha de desafiar a nadie a esgrimir, sino a luchar o a tirar la barra,
pues tiene edad y fuerzas para ello; que destos a quien llaman diestros he
oído decir que meten una punta de una espada por el ojo de una aguja.
— Yo me contento —respondió Corchuelo— de haber caído de mi burra, y de que
me haya mostrado la experiencia la verdad, de quien tan lejos estaba.
Y, levantándose, abrazó al licenciado, y quedaron más amigos que de antes,
y no queriendo esperar al escribano, que había ido por la espada, por
parecerle que tardaría mucho; y así, determinaron seguir, por llegar
temprano a la aldea de Quiteria, de donde todos eran.
En lo que faltaba del camino, les fue contando el licenciado las
excelencias de la espada, con tantas razones demostrativas y con tantas
figuras y demostraciones matemáticas, que todos quedaron enterados de la
bondad de la ciencia, y Corchuelo reducido de su pertinacia.
Era anochecido, pero antes que llegasen les pareció a todos que estaba
delante del pueblo un cielo lleno de inumerables y resplandecientes
estrellas. Oyeron, asimismo, confusos y suaves sonidos de diversos
instrumentos, como de flautas, tamborinos, salterios, albogues, panderos y
sonajas; y cuando llegaron cerca vieron que los árboles de una enramada,
que a mano habían puesto a la entrada del pueblo, estaban todos llenos de
luminarias, a quien no ofendía el viento, que entonces no soplaba sino tan
manso que no tenía fuerza para mover las hojas de los árboles. Los músicos
eran los regocijadores de la boda, que en diversas cuadrillas por aquel
agradable sitio andaban, unos bailando, y otros cantando, y otros tocando
la diversidad de los referidos instrumentos. En efecto, no parecía sino que
por todo aquel prado andaba corriendo la alegría y saltando el contento.
Otros muchos andaban ocupados en levantar andamios, de donde con comodidad
pudiesen ver otro día las representaciones y danzas que se habían de hacer
en aquel lugar dedicado para solenizar las bodas del rico Camacho y las
exequias de Basilio. No quiso entrar en el lugar don Quijote, aunque se lo
pidieron así el labrador como el bachiller; pero él dio por disculpa,
bastantísima a su parecer, ser costumbre de los caballeros andantes dormir
por los campos y florestas antes que en los poblados, aunque fuese debajo
de dorados techos; y con esto, se desvió un poco del camino, bien contra la
voluntad de Sancho, viniéndosele a la memoria el buen alojamiento que había
tenido en el castillo o casa de don Diego.
Capítulo XX. Donde se cuentan las bodas de Camacho el rico, con el suceso
de Basilio el pobre
Apenas la blanca aurora había dado lugar a que el luciente Febo, con el
ardor de sus calientes rayos, las líquidas perlas de sus cabellos de oro
enjugase, cuando don Quijote, sacudiendo la pereza de sus miembros, se puso
en pie y llamó a su escudero Sancho, que aún todavía roncaba; lo cual visto
por don Quijote, antes que le despertase, le dijo:
— ¡Oh tú, bienaventurado sobre cuantos viven sobre la haz de la tierra, pues
sin tener invidia ni ser invidiado, duermes con sosegado espíritu, ni te
persiguen encantadores, ni sobresaltan encantamentos! Duerme, digo otra
vez, y lo diré otras ciento, sin que te tengan en contina vigilia celos de
tu dama, ni te desvelen pensamientos de pagar deudas que debas, ni de lo
que has de hacer para comer otro día tú y tu pequeña y angustiada familia.
Ni la ambición te inquieta, ni la pompa vana del mundo te fatiga, pues los
límites de tus deseos no se estienden a más que a pensar tu jumento; que el
de tu persona sobre mis hombros le tienes puesto: contrapeso y carga que
puso la naturaleza y la costumbre a los señores. Duerme el criado, y está
velando el señor, pensando cómo le ha de sustentar, mejorar y hacer
mercedes. La congoja de ver que el cielo se hace de bronce sin acudir a la
tierra con el conveniente rocío no aflige al criado, sino al señor, que ha
de sustentar en la esterilidad y hambre al que le sirvió en la fertilidad y
abundancia.
A todo esto no respondió Sancho, porque dormía, ni despertara tan presto si
don Quijote con el cuento de la lanza no le hiciere volver en sí. Despertó,
en fin, soñoliento y perezoso, y, volviendo el rostro a todas partes, dijo:
— De la parte desta enramada, si no me engaño, sale un tufo y olor harto más
de torreznos asados que de juncos y tomillos: bodas que por tales olores
comienzan, para mi santiguada que deben de ser abundantes y generosas.
— Acaba, glotón —dijo don Quijote—; ven, iremos a ver estos desposorios, por
ver lo que hace el desdeñado Basilio.
— Mas que haga lo que quisiere —respondió Sancho—: no fuera él pobre y
casárase con Quiteria. ¿No hay más sino tener un cuarto y querer alzarse
por las nubes? A la fe, señor, yo soy de parecer que el pobre debe de
contentarse con lo que hallare, y no pedir cotufas en el golfo. Yo apostaré
un brazo que puede Camacho envolver en reales a Basilio; y si esto es así,
como debe de ser, bien boba fuera Quiteria en desechar las galas y las
joyas que le debe de haber dado, y le puede dar Camacho, por escoger el
tirar de la barra y el jugar de la negra de Basilio. Sobre un buen tiro de
barra o sobre una gentil treta de espada no dan un cuartillo de vino en la
taberna. Habilidades y gracias que no son vendibles, mas que las tenga el
conde Dirlos; pero, cuando las tales gracias caen sobre quien tiene buen
dinero, tal sea mi vida como ellas parecen. Sobre un buen cimiento se puede
levantar un buen edificio, y el mejor cimiento y zanja del mundo es el
dinero.
— Por quien Dios es, Sancho —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, que concluyas
con tu arenga; que tengo para mí que si te dejasen seguir en las que a cada
paso comienzas, no te quedaría tiempo para comer ni para dormir, que todo
le gastarías en hablar.
— Si vuestra merced tuviera buena memoria —replicó Sancho—, debiérase
acordar de los capítulos de nuestro concierto antes que esta última vez
saliésemos de casa: uno dellos fue que me había de dejar hablar todo
aquello que quisiese, con que no fuese contra el prójimo ni contra la
autoridad de vuesa merced; y hasta agora me parece que no he contravenido
contra el tal capítulo.
— Yo no me acuerdo, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, del tal capítulo; y,
puesto que sea así, quiero que calles y vengas, que ya los instrumentos que
anoche oímos vuelven a alegrar los valles, y sin duda los desposorios se
celebrarán en el frescor de la mañana, y no en el calor de la tarde.
Hizo Sancho lo que su señor le mandaba, y, poniendo la silla a Rocinante y
la albarda al rucio, subieron los dos, y paso ante paso se fueron entrando
por la enramada.
Lo primero que se le ofreció a la vista de Sancho fue, espetado en un
asador de un olmo entero, un entero novillo; y en el fuego donde se había
de asar ardía un mediano monte de leña, y seis ollas que alrededor de la
hoguera estaban no se habían hecho en la común turquesa de las demás ollas,
porque eran seis medias tinajas, que cada una cabía un rastro de carne: así
embebían y encerraban en sí carneros enteros, sin echarse de ver, como si
fueran palominos; las liebres ya sin pellejo y las gallinas sin pluma que
estaban colgadas por los árboles para sepultarlas en las ollas no tenían
número; los pájaros y caza de diversos géneros eran infinitos, colgados de
los árboles para que el aire los enfriase.
Contó Sancho más de sesenta zaques de más de a dos arrobas cada uno, y
todos llenos, según después pareció, de generosos vinos; así había rimeros
de pan blanquísimo, como los suele haber de montones de trigo en las eras;
los quesos, puestos como ladrillos enrejados, formaban una muralla, y dos
calderas de aceite, mayores que las de un tinte, servían de freír cosas de
masa, que con dos valientes palas las sacaban fritas y las zabullían en
otra caldera de preparada miel que allí junto estaba.
Los cocineros y cocineras pasaban de cincuenta: todos limpios, todos
diligentes y todos contentos. En el dilatado vientre del novillo estaban
doce tiernos y pequeños lechones, que, cosidos por encima, servían de darle
sabor y enternecerle. Las especias de diversas suertes no parecía haberlas
comprado por libras, sino por arrobas, y todas estaban de manifiesto en una
grande arca. Finalmente, el aparato de la boda era rústico, pero tan
abundante que podía sustentar a un ejército.
Todo lo miraba Sancho Panza, y todo lo contemplaba, y de todo se
aficionaba: primero le cautivaron y rindieron el deseo las ollas, de quién
él tomara de bonísima gana un mediano puchero; luego le aficionaron la
voluntad los zaques; y, últimamente, las frutas de sartén, si es que se
podían llamar sartenes las tan orondas calderas; y así, sin poderlo sufrir
ni ser en su mano hacer otra cosa, se llegó a uno de los solícitos
cocineros, y, con corteses y hambrientas razones, le rogó le dejase mojar
un mendrugo de pan en una de aquellas ollas. A lo que el cocinero
respondió:
— Hermano, este día no es de aquellos sobre quien tiene juridición la
hambre, merced al rico Camacho. Apeaos y mirad si hay por ahí un cucharón,
y espumad una gallina o dos, y buen provecho os hagan.
— No veo ninguno —respondió Sancho.
— Esperad —dijo el cocinero—. ¡Pecador de mí, y qué melindroso y para poco
debéis de ser!
Y, diciendo esto, asió de un caldero, y, encajándole en una de las medias
tinajas, sacó en él tres gallinas y dos gansos, y dijo a Sancho:
— Comed, amigo, y desayunaos con esta espuma, en tanto que se llega la hora
del yantar.
— No tengo en qué echarla —respondió Sancho.
— Pues llevaos —dijo el cocinero— la cuchara y todo, que la riqueza y el
contento de Camacho todo lo suple.
En tanto, pues, que esto pasaba Sancho, estaba don Quijote mirando cómo,
por una parte de la enramada, entraban hasta doce labradores sobre doce
hermosísimas yeguas, con ricos y vistosos jaeces de campo y con muchos
cascabeles en los petrales, y todos vestidos de regocijo y fiestas; los
cuales, en concertado tropel, corrieron no una, sino muchas carreras por el
prado, con regocijada algazara y grita, diciendo:
— ¡Vivan Camacho y Quiteria: él tan rico como ella hermosa, y ella la más
hermosa del mundo!
Oyendo lo cual don Quijote, dijo entre sí:
— Bien parece que éstos no han visto a mi Dulcinea del Toboso, que si la
hubieran visto, ellos se fueran a la mano en las alabanzas desta su
Quiteria.
De allí a poco comenzaron a entrar por diversas partes de la enramada
muchas y diferentes danzas, entre las cuales venía una de espadas, de hasta
veinte y cuatro zagales de gallardo parecer y brío, todos vestidos de
delgado y blanquísimo lienzo, con sus paños de tocar, labrados de varias
colores de fina seda; y al que los guiaba, que era un ligero mancebo,
preguntó uno de los de las yeguas si se había herido alguno de los
danzantes.
— Por ahora, bendito sea Dios, no se ha herido nadie: todos vamos sanos.
Y luego comenzó a enredarse con los demás compañeros, con tantas vueltas y
con tanta destreza que, aunque don Quijote estaba hecho a ver semejantes
danzas, ninguna le había parecido tan bien como aquélla.
También le pareció bien otra que entró de doncellas hermosísimas, tan mozas
que, al parecer, ninguna bajaba de catorce ni llegaba a diez y ocho años,
vestidas todas de palmilla verde, los cabellos parte tranzados y parte
sueltos, pero todos tan rubios, que con los del sol podían tener
competencia, sobre los cuales traían guirnaldas de jazmines, rosas,
amaranto y madreselva compuestas. Guiábalas un venerable viejo y una
anciana matrona, pero más ligeros y sueltos que sus años prometían.
Hacíales el son una gaita zamorana, y ellas, llevando en los rostros y en
los ojos a la honestidad y en los pies a la ligereza, se mostraban las
mejores bailadoras del mundo.
Tras ésta entró otra danza de artificio y de las que llaman habladas. Era
de ocho ninfas, repartidas en dos hileras: de la una hilera era guía el
dios Cupido, y de la otra, el Interés; aquél, adornado de alas, arco,
aljaba y saetas; éste, vestido de ricas y diversas colores de oro y seda.
Las ninfas que al Amor seguían traían a las espaldas, en pargamino blanco y
letras grandes, escritos sus nombres: poesía era el título de la primera,
el de la segunda discreción, el de la tercera buen linaje, el de la cuarta
valentía; del modo mesmo venían señaladas las que al Interés seguían: decía
liberalidad el título de la primera, dádiva el de la segunda, tesoro el de
la tercera y el de la cuarta posesión pacífica. Delante de todos venía un
castillo de madera, a quien tiraban cuatro salvajes, todos vestidos de
yedra y de cáñamo teñido de verde, tan al natural, que por poco espantaran
a Sancho. En la frontera del castillo y en todas cuatro partes de sus
cuadros traía escrito: castillo del buen recato. Hacíanles el son cuatro
diestros tañedores de tamboril y flauta.
Comenzaba la danza Cupido, y, habiendo hecho dos mudanzas, alzaba los ojos
y flechaba el arco contra una doncella que se ponía entre las almenas del
castillo, a la cual desta suerte dijo:
-Yo soy el dios poderoso
en el aire y en la tierra
y en el ancho mar undoso,
y en cuanto el abismo encierra
en su báratro espantoso.
Nunca conocí qué es miedo;
todo cuanto quiero puedo,
aunque quiera lo imposible,
y en todo lo que es posible
mando, quito, pongo y vedo.
Acabó la copla, disparó una flecha por lo alto del castillo y retiróse a
su puesto. Salió luego el Interés, y hizo otras dos mudanzas; callaron los
tamborinos, y él dijo:
-Soy quien puede más que Amor,
y es Amor el que me guía;
soy de la estirpe mejor
que el cielo en la tierra cría,
más conocida y mayor.
Soy el Interés, en quien
pocos suelen obrar bien,
y obrar sin mí es gran milagro;
y cual soy te me consagro,
por siempre jamás, amén.
Retiróse el Interés, y hízose adelante la Poesía; la cual, después de haber
hecho sus mudanzas como los demás, puestos los ojos en la doncella del
castillo, dijo:
-En dulcísimos conceptos,
la dulcísima Poesía,
altos, graves y discretos,
señora, el alma te envía
envuelta entre mil sonetos.
Si acaso no te importuna
mi porfía, tu fortuna,
de otras muchas invidiada,
será por mí levantada
sobre el cerco de la luna.
Desvióse la Poesía, y de la parte del Interés salió la Liberalidad, y,
después de hechas sus mudanzas, dijo:
-Llaman Liberalidad
al dar que el estremo huye
de la prodigalidad,
y del contrario, que arguye
tibia y floja voluntad.
Mas yo, por te engrandecer,
de hoy más, pródiga he de ser;
que, aunque es vicio, es vicio honrado
y de pecho enamorado,
que en el dar se echa de ver.
Deste modo salieron y se retiraron todas las dos figuras de las dos
escuadras, y cada uno hizo sus mudanzas y dijo sus versos, algunos
elegantes y algunos ridículos, y sólo tomó de memoria don Quijote —que la
tenía grande— los ya referidos; y luego se mezclaron todos, haciendo y
deshaciendo lazos con gentil donaire y desenvoltura; y cuando pasaba el
Amor por delante del castillo, disparaba por alto sus flechas, pero el
Interés quebraba en él alcancías doradas.
Finalmente, después de haber bailado un buen espacio, el Interés sacó un
bolsón, que le formaba el pellejo de un gran gato romano, que parecía estar
lleno de dineros, y, arrojándole al castillo, con el golpe se desencajaron
las tablas y se cayeron, dejando a la doncella descubierta y sin defensa
alguna. Llegó el Interés con las figuras de su valía, y, echándola una gran
cadena de oro al cuello, mostraron prenderla, rendirla y cautivarla; lo
cual visto por el Amor y sus valedores, hicieron ademán de quitársela; y
todas las demostraciones que hacían eran al son de los tamborinos, bailando
y danzando concertadamente. Pusiéronlos en paz los salvajes, los cuales con
mucha presteza volvieron a armar y a encajar las tablas del castillo, y la
doncella se encerró en él como de nuevo, y con esto se acabó la danza con
gran contento de los que la miraban.
Preguntó don Quijote a una de las ninfas que quién la había compuesto y
ordenado. Respondióle que un beneficiado de aquel pueblo, que tenía gentil
caletre para semejantes invenciones.
— Yo apostaré —dijo don Quijote— que debe de ser más amigo de Camacho que de
Basilio el tal bachiller o beneficiado, y que debe de tener más de satírico
que de vísperas: ¡bien ha encajado en la danza las habilidades de Basilio y
las riquezas de Camacho!
Sancho Panza, que lo escuchaba todo, dijo:
— El rey es mi gallo: a Camacho me atengo.
— En fin —dijo don Quijote—, bien se parece, Sancho, que eres villano y de
aquéllos que dicen: "¡Viva quien vence!"
— No sé de los que soy —respondió Sancho—, pero bien sé que nunca de ollas
de Basilio sacaré yo tan elegante espuma como es esta que he sacado de las
de Camacho.
Y enseñóle el caldero lleno de gansos y de gallinas, y, asiendo de una,
comenzó a comer con mucho donaire y gana, y dijo:
— ¡A la barba de las habilidades de Basilio!, que tanto vales cuanto tienes,
y tanto tienes cuanto vales. Dos linajes solos hay en el mundo, como decía
una agüela mía, que son el tener y el no tener, aunque ella al del tener se
atenía; y el día de hoy, mi señor don Quijote, antes se toma el pulso al
haber que al saber: un asno cubierto de oro parece mejor que un caballo
enalbardado. Así que vuelvo a decir que a Camacho me atengo, de cuyas ollas
son abundantes espumas gansos y gallinas, liebres y conejos; y de las de
Basilio serán, si viene a mano, y aunque no venga sino al pie, aguachirle.
— ¿Has acabado tu arenga, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote.
— Habréla acabado —respondió Sancho—, porque veo que vuestra merced recibe
pesadumbre con ella; que si esto no se pusiera de por medio, obra había
cortada para tres días.
— Plega a Dios, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—, que yo te vea mudo antes que
me muera.
— Al paso que llevamos —respondió Sancho—, antes que vuestra merced se muera
estaré yo mascando barro, y entonces podrá ser que esté tan mudo que no
hable palabra hasta la fin del mundo, o, por lo menos, hasta el día del
Juicio.
— Aunque eso así suceda, ¡oh Sancho! —respondió don Quijote—, nunca llegará
tu silencio a do ha llegado lo que has hablado, hablas y tienes de hablar
en tu vida; y más, que está muy puesto en razón natural que primero llegue
el día de mi muerte que el de la tuya; y así, jamás pienso verte mudo, ni
aun cuando estés bebiendo o durmiendo, que es lo que puedo encarecer.
— A buena fe, señor —respondió Sancho—, que no hay que fiar en la
descarnada, digo, en la muerte, la cual también come cordero como carnero;
y a nuestro cura he oído decir que con igual pie pisaba las altas torres de
los reyes como las humildes chozas de los pobres. Tiene esta señora más de
poder que de melindre: no es nada asquerosa, de todo come y a todo hace, y
de toda suerte de gentes, edades y preeminencias hinche sus alforjas. No es
segador que duerme las siestas, que a todas horas siega, y corta así la
seca como la verde yerba; y no parece que masca, sino que engulle y traga
cuanto se le pone delante, porque tiene hambre canina, que nunca se harta;
y, aunque no tiene barriga, da a entender que está hidrópica y sedienta de
beber solas las vidas de cuantos viven, como quien se bebe un jarro de agua
fría.
— No más, Sancho —dijo a este punto don Quijote—. Tente en buenas, y no te
dejes caer; que en verdad que lo que has dicho de la muerte por tus
rústicos términos es lo que pudiera decir un buen predicador. Dígote,
Sancho que si como tienes buen natural y discreción, pudieras tomar un
púlpito en la mano y irte por ese mundo predicando lindezas...
— Bien predica quien bien vive —respondió Sancho—, y yo no sé otras
tologías.
— Ni las has menester —dijo don Quijote—; pero yo no acabo de entender ni
alcanzar cómo, siendo el principio de la sabiduría el temor de Dios, tú,
que temes más a un lagarto que a Él, sabes tanto.
— Juzgue vuesa merced, señor, de sus caballerías —respondió Sancho—, y no se
meta en juzgar de los temores o valentías ajenas, que tan gentil temeroso
soy yo de Dios como cada hijo de vecino; y déjeme vuestra merced despabilar
esta espuma, que lo demás todas son palabras ociosas, de que nos han de
pedir cuenta en la otra vida.
Y, diciendo esto, comenzó de nuevo a dar asalto a su caldero, con tan
buenos alientos que despertó los de don Quijote, y sin duda le ayudara, si
no lo impidiera lo que es fuerza se diga adelante.
Capítulo XXI. Donde se prosiguen las bodas de Camacho, con otros gustosos
sucesos
Cuando estaban don Quijote y Sancho en las razones referidas en el capítulo
antecedente, se oyeron grandes voces y gran ruido, y dábanlas y causábanle
los de las yeguas, que con larga carrera y grita iban a recebir a los
novios, que, rodeados de mil géneros de instrumentos y de invenciones,
venían acompañados del cura, y de la parentela de entrambos, y de toda la
gente más lucida de los lugares circunvecinos, todos vestidos de fiesta. Y
como Sancho vio a la novia, dijo:
— A buena fe que no viene vestida de labradora, sino de garrida palaciega.
¡Pardiez, que según diviso, que las patenas que había de traer son ricos
corales, y la palmilla verde de Cuenca es terciopelo de treinta pelos! ¡Y
montas que la guarnición es de tiras de lienzo, blanca!, ¡voto a mí que es
de raso!; pues, ¡tomadme las manos, adornadas con sortijas de azabache!: no
medre yo si no son anillos de oro, y muy de oro, y empedrados con pelras
blancas como una cuajada, que cada una debe de valer un ojo de la cara. ¡Oh
hideputa, y qué cabellos; que, si no son postizos, no los he visto mas
luengos ni más rubios en toda mi vida! ¡No, sino ponedla tacha en el brío y
en el talle, y no la comparéis a una palma que se mueve cargada de racimos
de dátiles, que lo mesmo parecen los dijes que trae pendientes de los
cabellos y de la garganta! Juro en mi ánima que ella es una chapada moza, y
que puede pasar por los bancos de Flandes.
Rióse don Quijote de las rústicas alabanzas de Sancho Panza; parecióle que,
fuera de su señora Dulcinea del Toboso, no había visto mujer más hermosa
jamás. Venía la hermosa Quiteria algo descolorida, y debía de ser de la
mala noche que siempre pasan las novias en componerse para el día venidero
de sus bodas. Íbanse acercando a un teatro que a un lado del prado estaba,
adornado de alfombras y ramos, adonde se habían de hacer los desposorios, y
de donde habían de mirar las danzas y las invenciones; y, a la sazón que
llegaban al puesto, oyeron a sus espaldas grandes voces, y una que decía:
— Esperaos un poco, gente tan inconsiderada como presurosa.
A cuyas voces y palabras todos volvieron la cabeza, y vieron que las daba
un hombre vestido, al parecer, de un sayo negro, jironado de carmesí a
llamas. Venía coronado —como se vio luego— con una corona de funesto
ciprés; en las manos traía un bastón grande. En llegando más cerca, fue
conocido de todos por el gallardo Basilio, y todos estuvieron suspensos,
esperando en qué habían de parar sus voces y sus palabras, temiendo algún
mal suceso de su venida en sazón semejante.
Llegó, en fin, cansado y sin aliento, y, puesto delante de los desposados,
hincando el bastón en el suelo, que tenía el cuento de una punta de acero,
mudada la color, puestos los ojos en Quiteria, con voz tremente y ronca,
estas razones dijo:
— Bien sabes, desconocida Quiteria, que conforme a la santa ley que
profesamos, que viviendo yo, tú no puedes tomar esposo; y juntamente no
ignoras que, por esperar yo que el tiempo y mi diligencia mejorasen los
bienes de mi fortuna, no he querido dejar de guardar el decoro que a tu
honra convenía; pero tú, echando a las espaldas todas las obligaciones que
debes a mi buen deseo, quieres hacer señor de lo que es mío a otro, cuyas
riquezas le sirven no sólo de buena fortuna, sino de bonísima ventura. Y
para que la tenga colmada, y no como yo pienso que la merece, sino como se
la quieren dar los cielos, yo, por mis manos, desharé el imposible o el
inconveniente que puede estorbársela, quitándome a mí de por medio. ¡Viva,
viva el rico Camacho con la ingrata Quiteria largos y felices siglos, y
muera, muera el pobre Basilio, cuya pobreza cortó las alas de su dicha y le
puso en la sepultura!
Y, diciendo esto, asió del bastón que tenía hincado en el suelo, y,
quedándose la mitad dél en la tierra, mostró que servía de vaina a un
mediano estoque que en él se ocultaba; y, puesta la que se podía llamar
empuñadura en el suelo, con ligero desenfado y determinado propósito se
arrojó sobre él, y en un punto mostró la punta sangrienta a las espaldas,
con la mitad del acerada cuchilla, quedando el triste bañado en su sangre y
tendido en el suelo, de sus mismas armas traspasado.
Acudieron luego sus amigos a favorecerle, condolidos de su miseria y
lastimosa desgracia; y, dejando don Quijote a Rocinante, acudió a
favorecerle y le tomó en sus brazos, y halló que aún no había espirado.
Quisiéronle sacar el estoque, pero el cura, que estaba presente, fue de
parecer que no se le sacasen antes de confesarle, porque el sacársele y el
espirar sería todo a un tiempo. Pero, volviendo un poco en sí Basilio, con
voz doliente y desmayada dijo:
— Si quisieses, cruel Quiteria, darme en este último y forzoso trance la
mano de esposa, aún pensaría que mi temeridad tendría desculpa, pues en
ella alcancé el bien de ser tuyo.
El cura, oyendo lo cual, le dijo que atendiese a la salud del alma antes
que a los gustos del cuerpo, y que pidiese muy de veras a Dios perdón de
sus pecados y de su desesperada determinación. A lo cual replicó Basilio
que en ninguna manera se confesaría si primero Quiteria no le daba la mano
de ser su esposa: que aquel contento le adobaría la voluntad y le daría
aliento para confesarse.
En oyendo don Quijote la petición del herido, en altas voces dijo que
Basilio pedía una cosa muy justa y puesta en razón, y además, muy hacedera,
y que el señor Camacho quedaría tan honrado recibiendo a la señora Quiteria
viuda del valeroso Basilio como si la recibiera del lado de su padre:
— Aquí no ha de haber más de un sí, que no tenga otro efecto que el
pronunciarle, pues el tálamo de estas bodas ha de ser la sepultura.
Todo lo oía Camacho, y todo le tenía suspenso y confuso, sin saber qué
hacer ni qué decir; pero las voces de los amigos de Basilio fueron tantas,
pidiéndole que consintiese que Quiteria le diese la mano de esposa, porque
su alma no se perdiese, partiendo desesperado desta vida, que le movieron,
y aun forzaron, a decir que si Quiteria quería dársela, que él se
contentaba, pues todo era dilatar por un momento el cumplimiento de sus
deseos.
Luego acudieron todos a Quiteria, y unos con ruegos, y otros con lágrimas,
y otros con eficaces razones, la persuadían que diese la mano al pobre
Basilio; y ella, más dura que un mármol y más sesga que una estatua,
mostraba que ni sabía ni podía, ni quería responder palabra; ni la
respondiera si el cura no la dijera que se determinase presto en lo que
había de hacer, porque tenía Basilio ya el alma en los dientes, y no daba
lugar a esperar inresolutas determinaciones.
Entonces la hermosa Quiteria, sin responder palabra alguna, turbada, al
parecer triste y pesarosa, llegó donde Basilio estaba, ya los ojos vueltos,
el aliento corto y apresurado, murmurando entre los dientes el nombre de
Quiteria, dando muestras de morir como gentil, y no como cristiano. Llegó,
en fin, Quiteria, y, puesta de rodillas, le pidió la mano por señas, y no
por palabras. Desencajó los ojos Basilio, y, mirándola atentamente, le
dijo:
— ¡Oh Quiteria, que has venido a ser piadosa a tiempo cuando tu piedad ha de
servir de cuchillo que me acabe de quitar la vida, pues ya no tengo fuerzas
para llevar la gloria que me das en escogerme por tuyo, ni para suspender
el dolor que tan apriesa me va cubriendo los ojos con la espantosa sombra
de la muerte! Lo que te suplico es, ¡oh fatal estrella mía!, que la mano
que me pides y quieres darme no sea por cumplimiento, ni para engañarme de
nuevo, sino que confieses y digas que, sin hacer fuerza a tu voluntad, me
la entregas y me la das como a tu legítimo esposo; pues no es razón que en
un trance como éste me engañes, ni uses de fingimientos con quien tantas
verdades ha tratado contigo.
Entre estas razones, se desmayaba, de modo que todos los presentes pensaban
que cada desmayo se había de llevar el alma consigo. Quiteria, toda honesta
y toda vergonzosa, asiendo con su derecha mano la de Basilio, le dijo:
— Ninguna fuerza fuera bastante a torcer mi voluntad; y así, con la más
libre que tengo te doy la mano de legítima esposa, y recibo la tuya, si es
que me la das de tu libre albedrío, sin que la turbe ni contraste la
calamidad en que tu discurso acelerado te ha puesto.
— Sí doy —respondió Basilio—, no turbado ni confuso, sino con el claro
entendimiento que el cielo quiso darme; y así, me doy y me entrego por tu
esposo.
— Y yo por tu esposa —respondió Quiteria—, ahora vivas largos años, ahora te
lleven de mis brazos a la sepultura.
— Para estar tan herido este mancebo —dijo a este punto Sancho Panza—, mucho
habla; háganle que se deje de requiebros y que atienda a su alma, que, a mi
parecer, más la tiene en la lengua que en los dientes.
Estando, pues, asidos de las manos Basilio y Quiteria, el cura, tierno y
lloroso, los echó la bendición y pidió al cielo diese buen poso al alma del
nuevo desposado; el cual, así como recibió la bendición, con presta
ligereza se levantó en pie, y con no vista desenvoltura se sacó el estoque,
a quien servía de vaina su cuerpo.
Quedaron todos los circunstantes admirados, y algunos dellos, más simples
que curiosos, en altas voces, comenzaron a decir:
— ¡Milagro, milagro!
Pero Basilio replicó:
— ¡No "milagro, milagro", sino industria, industria!
El cura, desatentado y atónito, acudió con ambas manos a tentar la herida,
y halló que la cuchilla había pasado, no por la carne y costillas de
Basilio, sino por un cañón hueco de hierro que, lleno de sangre, en aquel
lugar bien acomodado tenía; preparada la sangre, según después se supo, de
modo que no se helase.
Finalmente, el cura y Camacho, con todos los más circunstantes, se tuvieron
por burlados y escarnidos. La esposa no dio muestras de pesarle de la
burla; antes, oyendo decir que aquel casamiento, por haber sido engañoso,
no había de ser valedero, dijo que ella le confirmaba de nuevo; de lo cual
coligieron todos que de consentimiento y sabiduría de los dos se había
trazado aquel caso, de lo que quedó Camacho y sus valedores tan corridos
que remitieron su venganza a las manos, y, desenvainando muchas espadas,
arremetieron a Basilio, en cuyo favor en un instante se desenvainaron casi
otras tantas. Y, tomando la delantera a caballo don Quijote, con la lanza
sobre el brazo y bien cubierto de su escudo, se hacía dar lugar de todos.
Sancho, a quien jamás pluguieron ni solazaron semejantes fechurías, se
acogió a las tinajas, donde había sacado su agradable espuma, pareciéndole
aquel lugar como sagrado, que había de ser tenido en respeto. Don Quijote,
a grandes voces, decía:
— Teneos, señores, teneos, que no es razón toméis venganza de los agravios
que el amor nos hace; y advertid que el amor y la guerra son una misma
cosa, y así como en la guerra es cosa lícita y acostumbrada usar de ardides
y estratagemas para vencer al enemigo, así en las contiendas y competencias
amorosas se tienen por buenos los embustes y marañas que se hacen para
conseguir el fin que se desea, como no sean en menoscabo y deshonra de la
cosa amada. Quiteria era de Basilio, y Basilio de Quiteria, por justa y
favorable disposición de los cielos. Camacho es rico, y podrá comprar su
gusto cuando, donde y como quisiere. Basilio no tiene más desta oveja, y no
se la ha de quitar alguno, por poderoso que sea; que a los dos que Dios
junta no podrá separar el hombre; y el que lo intentare, primero ha de
pasar por la punta desta lanza.
Y, en esto, la blandió tan fuerte y tan diestramente, que puso pavor en
todos los que no le conocían, y tan intensamente se fijó en la imaginación
de Camacho el desdén de Quiteria, que se la borró de la memoria en un
instante; y así, tuvieron lugar con él las persuasiones del cura, que era
varón prudente y bien intencionado, con las cuales quedó Camacho y los de
su parcialidad pacíficos y sosegados; en señal de lo cual volvieron las
espadas a sus lugares, culpando más a la facilidad de Quiteria que a la
industria de Basilio; haciendo discurso Camacho que si Quiteria quería bien
a Basilio doncella, también le quisiera casada, y que debía de dar gracias
al cielo, más por habérsela quitado que por habérsela dado.
Consolado, pues, y pacífico Camacho y los de su mesnada, todos los de la de
Basilio se sosegaron, y el rico Camacho, por mostrar que no sentía la
burla, ni la estimaba en nada, quiso que las fiestas pasasen adelante como
si realmente se desposara; pero no quisieron asistir a ellas Basilio ni su
esposa ni secuaces; y así, se fueron a la aldea de Basilio, que también los
pobres virtuosos y discretos tienen quien los siga, honre y ampare, como
los ricos tienen quien los lisonjee y acompañe.
Llevarónse consigo a don Quijote, estimándole por hombre de valor y de pelo
en pecho. A sólo Sancho se le escureció el alma, por verse imposibilitado
de aguardar la espléndida comida y fiestas de Camacho, que duraron hasta la
noche; y así, asenderado y triste, siguió a su señor, que con la cuadrilla
de Basilio iba, y así se dejó atrás las ollas de Egipto, aunque las llevaba
en el alma, cuya ya casi consumida y acabada espuma, que en el caldero
llevaba, le representaba la gloria y la abundancia del bien que perdía; y
así, congojado y pensativo, aunque sin hambre, sin apearse del rucio,
siguió las huellas de Rocinante.
Capítulo XXII. Donde se da cuenta de la grande aventura de la cueva de
Montesinos, que está en el corazón de la Mancha, a quien dio felice cima el
valeroso don Quijote de la Mancha
Grandes fueron y muchos los regalos que los desposados hicieron a don
Quijote, obligados de las muestras que había dado defendiendo su causa, y
al par de la valentía le graduaron la discreción, teniéndole por un Cid en
las armas y por un Cicerón en la elocuencia. El buen Sancho se refociló
tres días a costa de los novios, de los cuales se supo que no fue traza
comunicada con la hermosa Quiteria el herirse fingidamente, sino industria
de Basilio, esperando della el mesmo suceso que se había visto; bien es
verdad que confesó que había dado parte de su pensamiento a algunos de sus
amigos, para que al tiempo necesario favoreciesen su intención y abonasen
su engaño.
— No se pueden ni deben llamar engaños —dijo don Quijote— los que ponen la
mira en virtuosos fines.
Y que el de casarse los enamorados era el fin de más excelencia,
advirtiendo que el mayor contrario que el amor tiene es la hambre y la
continua necesidad, porque el amor es todo alegría, regocijo y contento, y
más cuando el amante está en posesión de la cosa amada, contra quien son
enemigos opuestos y declarados la necesidad y la pobreza; y que todo esto
decía con intención de que se dejase el señor Basilio de ejercitar las
habilidades que sabe, que, aunque le daban fama, no le daban dineros, y que
atendiese a granjear hacienda por medios lícitos e industriosos, que nunca
faltan a los prudentes y aplicados.
— El pobre honrado, si es que puede ser honrado el pobre, tiene prenda en
tener mujer hermosa, que, cuando se la quitan, le quitan la honra y se la
matan. La mujer hermosa y honrada, cuyo marido es pobre, merece ser
coronada con laureles y palmas de vencimiento y triunfo. La hermosura, por
sí sola, atrae las voluntades de cuantos la miran y conocen, y como a
señuelo gustoso se le abaten las águilas reales y los pájaros altaneros;
pero si a la tal hermosura se le junta la necesidad y la estrecheza,
también la embisten los cuervos, los milanos y las otras aves de rapiña; y
la que está a tantos encuentros firme bien merece llamarse corona de su
marido. Mirad, discreto Basilio —añadió don Quijote—: opinión fue de no sé
qué sabio que no había en todo el mundo sino una sola mujer buena, y daba
por consejo que cada uno pensase y creyese que aquella sola buena era la
suya, y así viviría contento. Yo no soy casado, ni hasta agora me ha venido
en pensamiento serlo; y, con todo esto, me atrevería a dar consejo al que
me lo pidiese del modo que había de buscar la mujer con quien se quisiese
casar. Lo primero, le aconsejaría que mirase más a la fama que a la
hacienda, porque la buena mujer no alcanza la buena fama solamente con ser
buena, sino con parecerlo; que mucho más dañan a las honras de las mujeres
las desenvolturas y libertades públicas que las maldades secretas. Si traes
buena mujer a tu casa, fácil cosa sería conservarla, y aun mejorarla, en
aquella bondad; pero si la traes mala, en trabajo te pondrá el enmendarla:
que no es muy hacedero pasar de un estremo a otro. Yo no digo que sea
imposible, pero téngolo por dificultoso.
Oía todo esto Sancho, y dijo entre sí:
— Este mi amo, cuando yo hablo cosas de meollo y de sustancia suele decir
que podría yo tomar un púlpito en las manos y irme por ese mundo adelante
predicando lindezas; y yo digo dél que cuando comienza a enhilar sentencias
y a dar consejos, no sólo puede tomar púlpito en las manos, sino dos en
cada dedo, y andarse por esas plazas a ¿qué quieres boca? ¡Válate el diablo
por caballero andante, que tantas cosas sabes! Yo pensaba en mi ánima que
sólo podía saber aquello que tocaba a sus caballerías, pero no hay cosa
donde no pique y deje de meter su cucharada.
Murmuraba esto algo Sancho, y entreoyóle su señor, y preguntóle:
— ¿Qué murmuras, Sancho?
— No digo nada, ni murmuro de nada —respondió Sancho—; sólo estaba diciendo
entre mí que quisiera haber oído lo que vuesa merced aquí ha dicho antes
que me casara, que quizá dijera yo agora: "El buey suelto bien se lame".
— ¿Tan mala es tu Teresa, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote.
— No es muy mala —respondió Sancho—, pero no es muy buena; a lo menos, no es
tan buena como yo quisiera.
— Mal haces, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, en decir mal de tu mujer, que, en
efecto, es madre de tus hijos.
— No nos debemos nada —respondió Sancho—, que también ella dice mal de mí
cuando se le antoja, especialmente cuando está celosa, que entonces súfrala
el mesmo Satanás.
Finalmente, tres días estuvieron con los novios, donde fueron regalados y
servidos como cuerpos de rey. Pidió don Quijote al diestro licenciado le
diese una guía que le encaminase a la cueva de Montesinos, porque tenía
gran deseo de entrar en ella y ver a ojos vistas si eran verdaderas las
maravillas que de ella se decían por todos aquellos contornos. El
licenciado le dijo que le daría a un primo suyo, famoso estudiante y muy
aficionado a leer libros de caballerías, el cual con mucha voluntad le
pondría a la boca de la mesma cueva, y le enseñaría las lagunas de Ruidera,
famosas ansimismo en toda la Mancha, y aun en toda España; y díjole que
llevaría con él gustoso entretenimiento, a causa que era mozo que sabía
hacer libros para imprimir y para dirigirlos a príncipes. Finalmente, el
primo vino con una pollina preñada, cuya albarda cubría un gayado tapete o
arpillera. Ensilló Sancho a Rocinante y aderezó al rucio, proveyó sus
alforjas, a las cuales acompañaron las del primo, asimismo bien proveídas,
y, encomendándose a Dios y despediéndose de todos, se pusieron en camino,
tomando la derrota de la famosa cueva de Montesinos.
En el camino preguntó don Quijote al primo de qué género y calidad eran sus
ejercicios, su profesión y estudios; a lo que él respondió que su
profesión era ser humanista; sus ejercicios y estudios, componer libros
para dar a la estampa, todos de gran provecho y no menos entretenimiento
para la república; que el uno se intitulaba el de las libreas, donde pinta
setecientas y tres libreas, con sus colores, motes y cifras, de donde
podían sacar y tomar las que quisiesen en tiempo de fiestas y regocijos los
caballeros cortesanos, sin andarlas mendigando de nadie, ni lambicando,
como dicen, el cerbelo, por sacarlas conformes a sus deseos e intenciones.
— Porque doy al celoso, al desdeñado, al olvidado y al ausente las que les
convienen, que les vendrán más justas que pecadoras. Otro libro tengo
también, a quien he de llamar Metamorfóseos, o Ovidio español, de invención
nueva y rara; porque en él, imitando a Ovidio a lo burlesco, pinto quién
fue la Giralda de Sevilla y el Ángel de la Madalena, quién el Caño de
Vecinguerra, de Córdoba, quiénes los Toros de Guisando, la Sierra Morena,
las fuentes de Leganitos y Lavapiés, en Madrid, no olvidándome de la del
Piojo, de la del Caño Dorado y de la Priora; y esto, con sus alegorías,
metáforas y translaciones, de modo que alegran, suspenden y enseñan a un
mismo punto. Otro libro tengo, que le llamo Suplemento a Virgilio Polidoro,
que trata de la invención de las cosas, que es de grande erudición y
estudio, a causa que las cosas que se dejó de decir Polidoro de gran
sustancia, las averiguo yo, y las declaro por gentil estilo. Olvidósele a
Virgilio de declararnos quién fue el primero que tuvo catarro en el mundo,
y el primero que tomó las unciones para curarse del morbo gálico, y yo lo
declaro al pie de la letra, y lo autorizo con más de veinte y cinco
autores: porque vea vuesa merced si he trabajado bien y si ha de ser útil
el tal libro a todo el mundo.
Sancho, que había estado muy atento a la narración del primo, le dijo:
— Dígame, señor, así Dios le dé buena manderecha en la impresión de sus
libros: ¿sabríame decir, que sí sabrá, pues todo lo sabe, quién fue el
primero que se rascó en la cabeza, que yo para mí tengo que debió de ser
nuestro padre Adán?
— Sí sería —respondió el primo—, porque Adán no hay duda sino que tuvo
cabeza y cabellos; y, siendo esto así, y siendo el primer hombre del mundo,
alguna vez se rascaría.
— Así lo creo yo —respondió Sancho—; pero dígame ahora: ¿quién fue el primer
volteador del mundo?
— En verdad, hermano —respondió el primo—, que no me sabré determinar por
ahora, hasta que lo estudie. Yo lo estudiaré, en volviendo adonde tengo mis
libros, y yo os satisfaré cuando otra vez nos veamos, que no ha de ser ésta
la postrera.
— Pues mire, señor —replicó Sancho—, no tome trabajo en esto, que ahora he
caído en la cuenta de lo que le he preguntado. Sepa que el primer volteador
del mundo fue Lucifer, cuando le echaron o arrojaron del cielo, que vino
volteando hasta los abismos.
— Tienes razón, amigo —dijo el primo.
Y dijo don Quijote:
— Esa pregunta y respuesta no es tuya, Sancho: a alguno las has oído decir.
— Calle, señor —replicó Sancho—, que a buena fe que si me doy a preguntar y
a responder, que no acabe de aquí a mañana. Sí, que para preguntar
necedades y responder disparates no he menester yo andar buscando ayuda de
vecinos.
— Más has dicho, Sancho, de lo que sabes —dijo don Quijote—; que hay algunos
que se cansan en saber y averiguar cosas que, después de sabidas y
averiguadas, no importan un ardite al entendimiento ni a la memoria.
En estas y otras gustosas pláticas se les pasó aquel día, y a la noche se
albergaron en una pequeña aldea, adonde el primo dijo a don Quijote que
desde allí a la cueva de Montesinos no había más de dos leguas, y que si
llevaba determinado de entrar en ella, era menester proverse de sogas, para
atarse y descolgarse en su profundidad.
Don Quijote dijo que, aunque llegase al abismo, había de ver dónde paraba;
y así, compraron casi cien brazas de soga, y otro día, a las dos de la
tarde, llegaron a la cueva, cuya boca es espaciosa y ancha, pero llena de
cambroneras y cabrahígos, de zarzas y malezas, tan espesas y intricadas,
que de todo en todo la ciegan y encubren. En viéndola, se apearon el primo,
Sancho y don Quijote, al cual los dos le ataron luego fortísimamente con
las sogas; y, en tanto que le fajaban y ceñían, le dijo Sancho:
— Mire vuestra merced, señor mío, lo que hace: no se quiera sepultar en
vida, ni se ponga adonde parezca frasco que le ponen a enfriar en algún
pozo. Sí, que a vuestra merced no le toca ni atañe ser el escudriñador
desta que debe de ser peor que mazmorra.
— Ata y calla —respondió don Quijote—, que tal empresa como aquésta, Sancho
amigo, para mí estaba guardada.
Y entonces dijo la guía:
— Suplico a vuesa merced, señor don Quijote, que mire bien y especule con
cien ojos lo que hay allá dentro: quizá habrá cosas que las ponga yo en el
libro de mis Transformaciones.
— En manos está el pandero que le sabrá bien tañer —respondió Sancho Panza.
Dicho esto y acabada la ligadura de don Quijote —que no fue sobre el arnés,
sino sobre el jubón de armar—, dijo don Quijote:
— Inadvertidos hemos andado en no habernos proveído de algún esquilón
pequeño, que fuera atado junto a mí en esta mesma soga, con cuyo sonido se
entendiera que todavía bajaba y estaba vivo; pero, pues ya no es posible, a
la mano de Dios, que me guíe.
Y luego se hincó de rodillas y hizo una oración en voz baja al cielo,
pidiendo a Dios le ayudase y le diese buen suceso en aquella, al parecer,
peligrosa y nueva aventura, y en voz alta dijo luego:
— ¡Oh señora de mis acciones y movimientos, clarísima y sin par Dulcinea del
Toboso! Si es posible que lleguen a tus oídos las plegarias y rogaciones
deste tu venturoso amante, por tu inaudita belleza te ruego las escuches,
que no son otras que rogarte no me niegues tu favor y amparo, ahora que
tanto le he menester. Yo voy a despeñarme, a empozarme y a hundirme en el
abismo que aquí se me representa, sólo porque conozca el mundo que si tú me
favoreces, no habrá imposible a quien yo no acometa y acabe.
Y, en diciendo esto, se acercó a la sima; vio no ser posible descolgarse,
ni hacer lugar a la entrada, si no era a fuerza de brazos, o a cuchilladas,
y así, poniendo mano a la espada, comenzó a derribar y a cortar de aquellas
malezas que a la boca de la cueva estaban, por cuyo ruido y estruendo
salieron por ella una infinidad de grandísimos cuervos y grajos, tan
espesos y con tanta priesa, que dieron con don Quijote en el suelo; y si él
fuera tan agorero como católico cristiano, lo tuviera a mala señal y
escusara de encerrarse en lugar semejante.
Finalmente se levantó, y, viendo que no salían más cuervos ni otras aves
noturnas, como fueron murciélagos, que asimismo entre los cuervos salieron,
dándole soga el primo y Sancho, se dejó calar al fondo de la caverna
espantosa; y, al entrar, echándole Sancho su bendición y haciendo sobre él
mil cruces, dijo:
— ¡Dios te guíe y la Peña de Francia, junto con la Trinidad de Gaeta, flor,
nata y espuma de los caballeros andantes! ¡Allá vas, valentón del mundo,
corazón de acero, brazos de bronce! ¡Dios te guíe, otra vez, y te vuelva
libre, sano y sin cautela a la luz desta vida, que dejas por enterrarte en
esta escuridad que buscas!
Casi las mismas plegarias y deprecaciones hizo el primo.
Iba don Quijote dando voces que le diesen soga y más soga, y ellos se la
daban poco a poco; y cuando las voces, que acanaladas por la cueva salían,
dejaron de oírse, ya ellos tenían descolgadas las cien brazas de soga, y
fueron de parecer de volver a subir a don Quijote, pues no le podían dar
más cuerda. Con todo eso, se detuvieron como media hora, al cabo del cual
espacio volvieron a recoger la soga con mucha facilidad y sin peso alguno,
señal que les hizo imaginar que don Quijote se quedaba dentro; y,
creyéndolo así, Sancho lloraba amargamente y tiraba con mucha priesa por
desengañarse, pero, llegando, a su parecer, a poco más de las ochenta
brazas, sintieron peso, de que en estremo se alegraron. Finalmente, a las
diez vieron distintamente a don Quijote, a quien dio voces Sancho,
diciéndole:
— Sea vuestra merced muy bien vuelto, señor mío, que ya pensábamos que se
quedaba allá para casta.
Pero no respondía palabra don Quijote; y, sacándole del todo, vieron que
traía cerrados los ojos, con muestras de estar dormido. Tendiéronle en el
suelo y desliáronle, y con todo esto no despertaba; pero tanto le volvieron
y revolvieron, sacudieron y menearon, que al cabo de un buen espacio volvió
en sí, desperezándose, bien como si de algún grave y profundo sueño
despertara; y, mirando a una y otra parte, como espantado, dijo:
— Dios os lo perdone, amigos; que me habéis quitado de la más sabrosa y
agradable vida y vista que ningún humano ha visto ni pasado. En efecto,
ahora acabo de conocer que todos los contentos desta vida pasan como sombra
y sueño, o se marchitan como la flor del campo. ¡Oh desdichado Montesinos!
¡Oh mal ferido Durandarte! ¡Oh sin ventura Belerma! ¡Oh lloroso Guadiana, y
vosotras sin dicha ijas de Ruidera, que mostráis en vuestras aguas las que
lloraron vuestros hermosos ojos!
Escuchaban el primo y Sancho las palabras de don Quijote, que las decía
como si con dolor inmenso las sacara de las entrañas. Suplicáronle les
diese a entender lo que decía, y les dijese lo que en aquel infierno había
visto.
— ¿Infierno le llamáis? —dijo don Quijote—; pues no le llaméis ansí, porque
no lo merece, como luego veréis.
Pidió que le diesen algo de comer, que traía grandísima hambre. Tendieron
la arpillera del primo sobre la verde yerba, acudieron a la despensa de sus
alforjas, y, sentados todos tres en buen amor y compaña, merendaron y
cenaron, todo junto. Levantada la arpillera, dijo don Quijote de la Mancha:
— No se levante nadie, y estadme, hijos, todos atentos.
Capítulo XXIII. De las admirables cosas que el estremado don Quijote contó
que había visto en la profunda cueva de Montesinos, cuya imposibilidad y
grandeza hace que se tenga esta aventura por apócrifa
Las cuatro de la tarde serían cuando el sol, entre nubes cubierto, con luz
escasa y templados rayos, dio lugar a don Quijote para que, sin calor y
pesadumbre, contase a sus dos clarísimos oyentes lo que en la cueva de
Montesinos había visto. Y comenzó en el modo siguiente:
— A obra de doce o catorce estados de la profundidad desta mazmorra, a la
derecha mano, se hace una concavidad y espacio capaz de poder caber en ella
un gran carro con sus mulas. Éntrale una pequeña luz por unos resquicios o
agujeros, que lejos le responden, abiertos en la superficie de la tierra.
Esta concavidad y espacio vi yo a tiempo cuando ya iba cansado y mohíno de
verme, pendiente y colgado de la soga, caminar por aquella escura región
abajo, sin llevar cierto ni determinado camino; y así, determiné entrarme
en ella y descansar un poco. Di voces, pidiéndoos que no descolgásedes más
soga hasta que yo os lo dijese, pero no debistes de oírme. Fui recogiendo
la soga que enviábades, y, haciendo della una rosca o rimero, me senté
sobre él, pensativo además, considerando lo que hacer debía para calar al
fondo, no teniendo quién me sustentase; y, estando en este pensamiento y
confusión, de repente y sin procurarlo, me salteó un sueño profundísimo; y,
cuando menos lo pensaba, sin saber cómo ni cómo no, desperté dél y me hallé
en la mitad del más bello, ameno y deleitoso prado que puede criar la
naturaleza ni imaginar la más discreta imaginación humana. Despabilé los
ojos, limpiémelos, y vi que no dormía, sino que realmente estaba despierto;
con todo esto, me tenté la cabeza y los pechos, por certificarme si era yo
mismo el que allí estaba, o alguna fantasma vana y contrahecha; pero el
tacto, el sentimiento, los discursos concertados que entre mí hacía, me
certificaron que yo era allí entonces el que soy aquí ahora. Ofrecióseme
luego a la vista un real y suntuoso palacio o alcázar, cuyos muros y
paredes parecían de transparente y claro cristal fabricados; del cual
abriéndose dos grandes puertas, vi que por ellas salía y hacía mí se venía
un venerable anciano, vestido con un capuz de bayeta morada, que por el
suelo le arrastraba: ceñíale los hombros y los pechos una beca de colegial,
de raso verde; cubríale la cabeza una gorra milanesa negra, y la barba,
canísima, le pasaba de la cintura; no traía arma ninguna, sino un rosario
de cuentas en la mano, mayores que medianas nueces, y los dieces asimismo
como huevos medianos de avestruz; el continente, el paso, la gravedad y la
anchísima presencia, cada cosa de por sí y todas juntas, me suspendieron y
admiraron. Llegóse a mí, y lo primero que hizo fue abrazarme estrechamente,
y luego decirme: ''Luengos tiempos ha, valeroso caballero don Quijote de la
Mancha, que los que estamos en estas soledades encantados esperamos verte,
para que des noticia al mundo de lo que encierra y cubre la profunda cueva
por donde has entrado, llamada la cueva de Montesinos: hazaña sólo guardada
para ser acometida de tu invencible corazón y de tu ánimo stupendo. Ven
conmigo, señor clarísimo, que te quiero mostrar las maravillas que este
transparente alcázar solapa, de quien yo soy alcaide y guarda mayor
perpetua, porque soy el mismo Montesinos, de quien la cueva toma nombre''.
Apenas me dijo que era Montesinos, cuando le pregunté si fue verdad lo que
en el mundo de acá arriba se contaba: que él había sacado de la mitad del
pecho, con una pequeña daga, el corazón de su grande amigo Durandarte y
llevádole a la Señora Belerma, como él se lo mandó al punto de su muerte.
Respondióme que en todo decían verdad, sino en la daga, porque no fue daga,
ni pequeña, sino un puñal buido, más agudo que una lezna.
— Debía de ser —dijo a este punto Sancho— el tal puñal de Ramón de Hoces, el
sevillano.
— No sé —prosiguió don Quijote—, pero no sería dese puñalero, porque Ramón
de Hoces fue ayer, y lo de Roncesvalles, donde aconteció esta desgracia, ha
muchos años; y esta averiguación no es de importancia, ni turba ni altera
la verdad y contesto de la historia.
— Así es —respondió el primo—; prosiga vuestra merced, señor don Quijote,
que le escucho con el mayor gusto del mundo.
— No con menor lo cuento yo —respondió don Quijote—; y así, digo que el
venerable Montesinos me metió en el cristalino palacio, donde en una sala
baja, fresquísima sobremodo y toda de alabastro, estaba un sepulcro de
mármol, con gran maestría fabricado, sobre el cual vi a un caballero
tendido de largo a largo, no de bronce, ni de mármol, ni de jaspe hecho,
como los suele haber en otros sepulcros, sino de pura carne y de puros
huesos. Tenía la mano derecha (que, a mi parecer, es algo peluda y nervosa,
señal de tener muchas fuerzas su dueño) puesta sobre el lado del corazón,
y, antes que preguntase nada a Montesinos, viéndome suspenso mirando al del
sepulcro, me dijo: ''Éste es mi amigo Durandarte, flor y espejo de los
caballeros enamorados y valientes de su tiempo; tiénele aquí encantado,
como me tiene a mí y a otros muchos y muchas, Merlín, aquel francés
encantador que dicen que fue hijo del diablo; y lo que yo creo es que no
fue hijo del diablo, sino que supo, como dicen, un punto más que el diablo.
El cómo o para qué nos encantó nadie lo sabe, y ello dirá andando los
tiempos, que no están muy lejos, según imagino. Lo que a mí me admira es
que sé, tan cierto como ahora es de día, que Durandarte acabó los de su
vida en mis brazos, y que después de muerto le saqué el corazón con mis
propias manos; y en verdad que debía de pesar dos libras, porque, según los
naturales, el que tiene mayor corazón es dotado de mayor valentía del que
le tiene pequeño. Pues siendo esto así, y que realmente murió este
caballero, ¿cómo ahora se queja y sospira de cuando en cuando, como si
estuviese vivo?'' Esto dicho, el mísero Durandarte, dando una gran voz,
dijo:
''¡Oh, mi primo Montesinos!
Lo postrero que os rogaba,
que cuando yo fuere muerto,
y mi ánima arrancada,
que llevéis mi corazón
adonde Belerma estaba,
sacándomele del pecho,
ya con puñal, ya con daga.''
Oyendo lo cual el venerable Montesinos, se puso de rodillas ante el
lastimado caballero, y, con lágrimas en los ojos, le dijo: ''Ya, señor
Durandarte, carísimo primo mío, ya hice lo que me mandastes en el aciago
día de nuestra pérdida: yo os saqué el corazón lo mejor que pude, sin que
os dejase una mínima parte en el pecho; yo le limpié con un pañizuelo de
puntas; yo partí con él de carrera para Francia, habiéndoos primero puesto
en el seno de la tierra, con tantas lágrimas, que fueron bastantes a
lavarme las manos y limpiarme con ellas la sangre que tenían, de haberos
andado en las entrañas; y, por más señas, primo de mi alma, en el primero
lugar que topé, saliendo de Roncesvalles, eché un poco de sal en vuestro
corazón, porque no oliese mal, y fuese, si no fresco, a lo menos amojamado,
a la presencia de la señora Belerma; la cual, con vos, y conmigo, y con
Guadiana, vuestro escudero, y con la dueña Ruidera y sus siete hijas y dos
sobrinas, y con otros muchos de vuestros conocidos y amigos, nos tiene aquí
encantados el sabio Merlín ha muchos años; y, aunque pasan de quinientos,
no se ha muerto ninguno de nosotros: solamente faltan Ruidera y sus hijas y
sobrinas, las cuales llorando, por compasión que debió de tener Merlín
dellas, las convirtió en otras tantas lagunas, que ahora, en el mundo de
los vivos y en la provincia de la Mancha, las llaman las lagunas de
Ruidera; las siete son de los reyes de España, y las dos sobrinas, de los
caballeros de una orden santísima, que llaman de San Juan. Guadiana,
vuestro escudero, plañendo asimesmo vuestra desgracia, fue convertido en un
río llamado de su mesmo nombre; el cual, cuando llegó a la superficie de la
tierra y vio el sol del otro cielo, fue tanto el pesar que sintió de ver
que os dejaba, que se sumergió en las entrañas de la tierra; pero, como no
es posible dejar de acudir a su natural corriente, de cuando en cuando sale
y se muestra donde el sol y las gentes le vean. Vanle administrando de sus
aguas las referidas lagunas, con las cuales y con otras muchas que se
llegan, entra pomposo y grande en Portugal. Pero, con todo esto, por
dondequiera que va muestra su tristeza y melancolía, y no se precia de
criar en sus aguas peces regalados y de estima, sino burdos y desabridos,
bien diferentes de los del Tajo dorado; y esto que agora os digo, ¡oh primo
mío!, os lo he dicho muchas veces; y, como no me respondéis, imagino que no
me dais crédito, o no me oís, de lo que yo recibo tanta pena cual Dios lo
sabe. Unas nuevas os quiero dar ahora, las cuales, ya que no sirvan de
alivio a vuestro dolor, no os le aumentarán en ninguna manera. Sabed que
tenéis aquí en vuestra presencia, y abrid los ojos y veréislo, aquel gran
caballero de quien tantas cosas tiene profetizadas el sabio Merlín, aquel
don Quijote de la Mancha, digo, que de nuevo y con mayores ventajas que en
los pasados siglos ha resucitado en los presentes la ya olvidada andante
caballería, por cuyo medio y favor podría ser que nosotros fuésemos
desencantados; que las grandes hazañas para los grandes hombres están
guardadas''. ''Y cuando así no sea —respondió el lastimado Durandarte con
voz desmayada y baja—, cuando así no sea, ¡oh primo!, digo, paciencia y
barajar''. Y, volviéndose de lado, tornó a su acostumbrado silencio, sin
hablar más palabra. Oyéronse en esto grandes alaridos y llantos,
acompañados de profundos gemidos y angustiados sollozos; volví la cabeza, y
vi por las paredes de cristal que por otra sala pasaba una procesión de dos
hileras de hermosísimas doncellas, todas vestidas de luto, con turbantes
blancos sobre las cabezas, al modo turquesco. Al cabo y fin de las hileras
venía una señora, que en la gravedad lo parecía, asimismo vestida de negro,
con tocas blancas tan tendidas y largas, que besaban la tierra. Su turbante
era mayor dos veces que el mayor de alguna de las otras; era cejijunta y la
nariz algo chata; la boca grande, pero colorados los labios; los dientes,
que tal vez los descubría, mostraban ser ralos y no bien puestos, aunque
eran blancos como unas peladas almendras; traía en las manos un lienzo
delgado, y entre él, a lo que pude divisar, un corazón de carne momia,
según venía seco y amojamado. Díjome Montesinos como toda aquella gente de
la procesión eran sirvientes de Durandarte y de Belerma, que allí con sus
dos señores estaban encantados, y que la última, que traía el corazón entre
el lienzo y en las manos, era la señora Belerma, la cual con sus doncellas
cuatro días en la semana hacían aquella procesión y cantaban, o, por mejor
decir, lloraban endechas sobre el cuerpo y sobre el lastimado corazón de su
primo; y que si me había parecido algo fea, o no tan hermosa como tenía la
fama, era la causa las malas noches y peores días que en aquel encantamento
pasaba, como lo podía ver en sus grandes ojeras y en su color quebradiza.
''Y no toma ocasión su amarillez y sus ojeras de estar con el mal mensil,
ordinario en las mujeres, porque ha muchos meses, y aun años, que no le
tiene ni asoma por sus puertas, sino del dolor que siente su corazón por el
que de contino tiene en las manos, que le renueva y trae a la memoria la
desgracia de su mal logrado amante; que si esto no fuera, apenas la
igualara en hermosura, donaire y brío la gran Dulcinea del Toboso, tan
celebrada en todos estos contornos, y aun en todo el mundo''. ''¡Cepos
quedos! —dije yo entonces—, señor don Montesinos: cuente vuesa merced su
historia como debe, que ya sabe que toda comparación es odiosa, y así, no
hay para qué comparar a nadie con nadie. La sin par Dulcinea del Toboso es
quien es, y la señora doña Belerma es quien es, y quien ha sido, y quédese
aquí''. A lo que él me respondió: ''Señor don Quijote, perdóneme vuesa
merced, que yo confieso que anduve mal, y no dije bien en decir que apenas
igualara la señora Dulcinea a la señora Belerma, pues me bastaba a mí haber
entendido, por no sé qué barruntos, que vuesa merced es su caballero, para
que me mordiera la lengua antes de compararla sino con el mismo cielo''.
Con esta satisfación que me dio el gran Montesinos se quietó mi corazón del
sobresalto que recebí en oír que a mi señora la comparaban con Belerma.
— Y aun me maravillo yo —dijo Sancho— de cómo vuestra merced no se subió
sobre el vejote, y le molió a coces todos los huesos, y le peló las barbas,
sin dejarle pelo en ellas.
— No, Sancho amigo —respondió don Quijote—, no me estaba a mí bien hacer
eso, porque estamos todos obligados a tener respeto a los ancianos, aunque
no sean caballeros, y principalmente a los que lo son y están encantados;
yo sé bien que no nos quedamos a deber nada en otras muchas demandas y
respuestas que entre los dos pasamos.
A esta sazón dijo el primo:
— Yo no sé, señor don Quijote, cómo vuestra merced en tan poco espacio de
tiempo como ha que está allá bajo, haya visto tantas cosas y hablado y
respondido tanto.
— ¿Cuánto ha que bajé? —preguntó don Quijote.
— Poco más de una hora —respondió Sancho.
— Eso no puede ser —replicó don Quijote—, porque allá me anocheció y
amaneció, y tornó a anochecer y amanecer tres veces; de modo que, a mi
cuenta, tres días he estado en aquellas partes remotas y escondidas a la
vista nuestra.
— Verdad debe de decir mi señor —dijo Sancho—, que, como todas las cosas que
le han sucedido son por encantamento, quizá lo que a nosotros nos parece un
hora, debe de parecer allá tres días con sus noches.
— Así será —respondió don Quijote.
— Y ¿ha comido vuestra merced en todo este tiempo, señor mío? —preguntó el
primo.
— No me he desayunado de bocado —respondió don Quijote—, ni aun he tenido
hambre, ni por pensamiento.
— Y los encantados, ¿comen? —dijo el primo.
— No comen —respondió don Quijote—, ni tienen escrementos mayores; aunque es
opinión que les crecen las uñas, las barbas y los cabellos.
— ¿Y duermen, por ventura, los encantados, señor? —preguntó Sancho.
— No, por cierto —respondió don Quijote—; a lo menos, en estos tres días que
yo he estado con ellos, ninguno ha pegado el ojo, ni yo tampoco.
— Aquí encaja bien el refrán —dijo Sancho— de dime con quién andas, decirte
he quién eres: ándase vuestra merced con encantados ayunos y vigilantes,
mirad si es mucho que ni coma ni duerma mientras con ellos anduviere. Pero
perdóneme vuestra merced, señor mío, si le digo que de todo cuanto aquí ha
dicho, lléveme Dios, que iba a decir el diablo, si le creo cosa alguna.
— ¿Cómo no? —dijo el primo—, pues ¿había de mentir el señor don Quijote,
que, aunque quisiera, no ha tenido lugar para componer e imaginar tanto
millón de mentiras?
— Yo no creo que mi señor miente —respondió Sancho.
— Si no, ¿qué crees? —le preguntó don Quijote.
— Creo —respondió Sancho— que aquel Merlín, o aquellos encantadores que
encantaron a toda la chusma que vuestra merced dice que ha visto y
comunicado allá bajo, le encajaron en el magín o la memoria toda esa
máquina que nos ha contado, y todo aquello que por contar le queda.
— Todo eso pudiera ser, Sancho —replicó don Quijote—, pero no es así, porque
lo que he contado lo vi por mis propios ojos y lo toqué con mis mismas
manos. Pero, ¿qué dirás cuando te diga yo ahora cómo, entre otras infinitas
cosas y maravillas que me mostró Montesinos, las cuales despacio y a sus
tiempos te las iré contando en el discurso de nuestro viaje, por no ser
todas deste lugar, me mostró tres labradoras que por aquellos amenísimos
campos iban saltando y brincando como cabras; y, apenas las hube visto,
cuando conocí ser la una la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso, y las otras dos
aquellas mismas labradoras que venían con ella, que hablamos a la salida
del Toboso? Pregunté a Montesinos si las conocía, respondióme que no, pero
que él imaginaba que debían de ser algunas señoras principales encantadas,
que pocos días había que en aquellos prados habían parecido; y que no me
maravillase desto, porque allí estaban otras muchas señoras de los pasados
y presentes siglos, encantadas en diferentes y estrañas figuras, entre las
cuales conocía él a la reina Ginebra y su dueña Quintañona, escanciando el
vino a Lanzarote,
cuando de Bretaña vino.
Cuando Sancho Panza oyó decir esto a su amo, pensó perder el juicio, o
morirse de risa; que, como él sabía la verdad del fingido encanto de
Dulcinea, de quien él había sido el encantador y el levantador de tal
testimonio, acabó de conocer indubitablemente que su señor estaba fuera de
juicio y loco de todo punto; y así, le dijo:
— En mala coyuntura y en peor sazón y en aciago día bajó vuestra merced,
caro patrón mío, al otro mundo, y en mal punto se encontró con el señor
Montesinos, que tal nos le ha vuelto. Bien se estaba vuestra merced acá
arriba con su entero juicio, tal cual Dios se le había dado, hablando
sentencias y dando consejos a cada paso, y no agora, contando los mayores
disparates que pueden imaginarse.
— Como te conozco, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, no hago caso de tus
palabras.
— Ni yo tampoco de las de vuestra merced —replicó Sancho—, siquiera me
hiera, siquiera me mate por las que le he dicho, o por las que le pienso
decir si en las suyas no se corrige y enmienda. Pero dígame vuestra merced,
ahora que estamos en paz: ¿cómo o en qué conoció a la señora nuestra ama? Y
si la habló, ¿qué dijo, y qué le respondió?
— Conocíla —respondió don Quijote— en que trae los mesmos vestidos que traía
cuando tú me le mostraste. Habléla, pero no me respondió palabra; antes, me
volvió las espaldas, y se fue huyendo con tanta priesa, que no la alcanzara
una jara. Quise seguirla, y lo hiciera, si no me aconsejara Montesinos que
no me cansase en ello, porque sería en balde, y más porque se llegaba la
hora donde me convenía volver a salir de la sima. Díjome asimesmo que,
andando el tiempo, se me daría aviso cómo habían de ser desencantados él, y
Belerma y Durandarte, con todos los que allí estaban; pero lo que más pena
me dio, de las que allí vi y noté, fue que, estándome diciendo Montesinos
estas razones, se llegó a mí por un lado, sin que yo la viese venir, una de
las dos compañeras de la sin ventura Dulcinea, y, llenos los ojos de
lágrimas, con turbada y baja voz, me dijo: ''Mi señora Dulcinea del Toboso
besa a vuestra merced las manos, y suplica a vuestra merced se la haga de
hacerla saber cómo está; y que, por estar en una gran necesidad, asimismo
suplica a vuestra merced, cuan encarecidamente puede, sea servido de
prestarle sobre este faldellín que aquí traigo, de cotonía, nuevo, media
docena de reales, o los que vuestra merced tuviere, que ella da su palabra
de volvérselos con mucha brevedad''. Suspendióme y admiróme el tal recado,
y, volviéndome al señor Montesinos, le pregunté: ''¿Es posible, señor
Montesinos, que los encantados principales padecen necesidad?'' A lo que él
me respondió: ''Créame vuestra merced, señor don Quijote de la Mancha, que
ésta que llaman necesidad adondequiera se usa, y por todo se estiende, y a
todos alcanza, y aun hasta los encantados no perdona; y, pues la señora
Dulcinea del Toboso envía a pedir esos seis reales, y la prenda es buena,
según parece, no hay sino dárselos; que, sin duda, debe de estar puesta en
algún grande aprieto''. ''Prenda, no la tomaré yo —le respondí—, ni menos
le daré lo que pide, porque no tengo sino solos cuatro reales''; los cuales
le di (que fueron los que tú, Sancho, me diste el otro día para dar limosna
a los pobres que topase por los caminos), y le dije: ''Decid, amiga mía, a
vuesa señora que a mí me pesa en el alma de sus trabajos, y que quisiera
ser un Fúcar para remediarlos; y que le hago saber que yo no puedo ni debo
tener salud careciendo de su agradable vista y discreta conversación, y que
le suplico, cuan encarecidamente puedo, sea servida su merced de dejarse
ver y tratar deste su cautivo servidor y asendereado caballero. Diréisle
también que, cuando menos se lo piense, oirá decir como yo he hecho un
juramento y voto, a modo de aquel que hizo el marqués de Mantua, de vengar
a su sobrino Baldovinos, cuando le halló para espirar en mitad de la
montiña, que fue de no comer pan a manteles, con las otras zarandajas que
allí añadió, hasta vengarle; y así le haré yo de no sosegar, y de andar las
siete partidas del mundo, con más puntualidad que las anduvo el infante don
Pedro de Portugal, hasta desencantarla''. ''Todo eso, y más, debe vuestra
merced a mi señora'', me respondió la doncella. Y, tomando los cuatro
reales, en lugar de hacerme una reverencia, hizo una cabriola, que se
levantó dos varas de medir en el aire.
— ¡Oh santo Dios! —dijo a este tiempo dando una gran voz Sancho—. ¿Es
posible que tal hay en el mundo, y que tengan en él tanta fuerza los
encantadores y encantamentos, que hayan trocado el buen juicio de mi señor
en una tan disparatada locura? ¡Oh señor, señor, por quien Dios es, que
vuestra merced mire por sí y vuelva por su honra, y no dé crédito a esas
vaciedades que le tienen menguado y descabalado el sentido!
— Como me quieres bien, Sancho, hablas desa manera —dijo don Quijote—; y,
como no estás experimentado en las cosas del mundo, todas las cosas que
tienen algo de dificultad te parecen imposibles; pero andará el tiempo,
como otra vez he dicho, y yo te contaré algunas de las que allá abajo he
visto, que te harán creer las que aquí he contado, cuya verdad ni admite
réplica ni disputa.
Capítulo XXIV. Donde se cuentan mil zarandajas tan impertinentes como
necesarias al verdadero entendimiento desta grande historia
Dice el que tradujo esta grande historia del original, de la que escribió
su primer autor Cide Hamete Benengeli, que, llegando al capítulo de la
aventura de la cueva de Montesinos, en el margen dél estaban escritas, de
mano del mesmo Hamete, estas mismas razones:
''No me puedo dar a entender, ni me puedo persuadir, que al valeroso don
Quijote le pasase puntualmente todo lo que en el antecedente capítulo queda
escrito: la razón es que todas las aventuras hasta aquí sucedidas han sido
contingibles y verisímiles, pero ésta desta cueva no le hallo entrada
alguna para tenerla por verdadera, por ir tan fuera de los términos
razonables. Pues pensar yo que don Quijote mintiese, siendo el más
verdadero hidalgo y el más noble caballero de sus tiempos, no es posible;
que no dijera él una mentira si le asaetearan. Por otra parte, considero
que él la contó y la dijo con todas las circunstancias dichas, y que no
pudo fabricar en tan breve espacio tan gran máquina de disparates; y si
esta aventura parece apócrifa, yo no tengo la culpa; y así, sin afirmarla
por falsa o verdadera, la escribo. Tú, letor, pues eres prudente, juzga lo
que te pareciere, que yo no debo ni puedo más; puesto que se tiene por
cierto que al tiempo de su fin y muerte dicen que se retrató della, y dijo
que él la había inventado, por parecerle que convenía y cuadraba bien con
las aventuras que había leído en sus historias''.
Y luego prosigue, diciendo:
Espantóse el primo, así del atrevimiento de Sancho Panza como de la
paciencia de su amo, y juzgó que del contento que tenía de haber visto a su
señora Dulcinea del Toboso, aunque encantada, le nacía aquella condición
blanda que entonces mostraba; porque, si así no fuera, palabras y razones
le dijo Sancho, que merecían molerle a palos; porque realmente le pareció
que había andado atrevidillo con su señor, a quien le dijo:
— Yo, señor don Quijote de la Mancha, doy por bien empleadísima la jornada
que con vuestra merced he hecho, porque en ella he granjeado cuatro cosas.
La primera, haber conocido a vuestra merced, que lo tengo a gran felicidad.
La segunda, haber sabido lo que se encierra en esta cueva de Montesinos,
con las mutaciones de Guadiana y de las lagunas de Ruidera, que me servirán
para el Ovidio español que traigo entre manos. La tercera, entender la
antigüedad de los naipes, que, por lo menos, ya se usaban en tiempo del
emperador Carlomagno, según puede colegirse de las palabras que vuesa
merced dice que dijo Durandarte, cuando, al cabo de aquel grande espacio
que estuvo hablando con él Montesinos, él despertó diciendo: ''Paciencia y
barajar''; y esta razón y modo de hablar no la pudo aprender encantado,
sino cuando no lo estaba, en Francia y en tiempo del referido emperador
Carlomagno. Y esta averiguación me viene pintiparada para el otro libro que
voy componiendo , que es Suplemento de Virgilio Polidoro, en la invención
de las antigüedades; y creo que en el suyo no se acordó de poner la de los
naipes, como la pondré yo ahora, que será de mucha importancia, y más
alegando autor tan grave y tan verdadero como es el señor Durandarte. La
cuarta es haber sabido con certidumbre el nacimiento del río Guadiana,
hasta ahora ignorado de las gentes.
— Vuestra merced tiene razón —dijo don Quijote—, pero querría yo saber, ya
que Dios le haga merced de que se le dé licencia para imprimir esos sus
libros, que lo dudo, a quién piensa dirigirlos.
— Señores y grandes hay en España a quien puedan dirigirse —dijo el primo.
— No muchos —respondió don Quijote—; y no porque no lo merezcan, sino que no
quieren admitirlos, por no obligarse a la satisfación que parece se debe al
trabajo y cortesía de sus autores. Un príncipe conozco yo que puede suplir
la falta de los demás, con tantas ventajas que, si me atreviere a decirlas,
quizá despertara la invidia en más de cuatro generosos pechos; pero quédese
esto aquí para otro tiempo más cómodo, y vamos a buscar adonde recogernos
esta noche.
— No lejos de aquí —respondió el primo— está una ermita, donde hace su
habitación un ermitaño, que dicen ha sido soldado, y está en opinión de ser
un buen cristiano, y muy discreto y caritativo además. Junto con la ermita
tiene una pequeña casa, que él ha labrado a su costa; pero, con todo,
aunque chica, es capaz de recibir huéspedes.
— ¿Tiene por ventura gallinas el tal ermitaño? —preguntó Sancho.
— Pocos ermitaños están sin ellas —respondió don Quijote—, porque no son los
que agora se usan como aquellos de los desiertos de Egipto, que se vestían
de hojas de palma y comían raíces de la tierra. Y no se entienda que por
decir bien de aquéllos no lo digo de aquéstos, sino que quiero decir que al
rigor y estrecheza de entonces no llegan las penitencias de los de agora;
pero no por esto dejan de ser todos buenos; a lo menos, yo por buenos los
juzgo; y, cuando todo corra turbio, menos mal hace el hipócrita que se
finge bueno que el público pecador.
Estando en esto, vieron que hacia donde ellos estaban venía un hombre a
pie, caminando apriesa, y dando varazos a un macho que venía cargado de
lanzas y de alabardas. Cuando llegó a ellos, los saludó y pasó de largo.
Don Quijote le dijo:
— Buen hombre, deteneos, que parece que vais con más diligencia que ese
macho ha menester.
— No me puedo detener, señor —respondió el hombre—, porque las armas que
veis que aquí llevo han de servir mañana; y así, me es forzoso el no
detenerme, y a Dios. Pero si quisiéredes saber para qué las llevo, en la
venta que está más arriba de la ermita pienso alojar esta noche; y si es
que hacéis este mesmo camino, allí me hallaréis, donde os contaré
maravillas. Y a Dios otra vez.
Y de tal manera aguijó el macho, que no tuvo lugar don Quijote de
preguntarle qué maravillas eran las que pensaba decirles; y, como él era
algo curioso y siempre le fatigaban deseos de saber cosas nuevas, ordenó
que al momento se partiesen y fuesen a pasar la noche en la venta, sin
tocar en la ermita, donde quisiera el primo que se quedaran.
Hízose así, subieron a caballo, y siguieron todos tres el derecho camino de
la venta, a la cual llegaron un poco antes de anochecer. Dijo el primo a
don Quijote que llegasen a ella a beber un trago. Apenas oyó esto Sancho
Panza, cuando encaminó el rucio a la ermita, y lo mismo hicieron don
Quijote y el primo; pero la mala suerte de Sancho parece que ordenó que el
ermitaño no estuviese en casa; que así se lo dijo una sotaermitaño que en
la ermita hallaron. Pidiéronle de lo caro; respondió que su señor no lo
tenía, pero que si querían agua barata, que se la daría de muy buena gana.
— Si yo la tuviera de agua —respondió Sancho—, pozos hay en el camino,
donde la hubiera satisfecho. ¡Ah bodas de Camacho y abundancia de la casa
de don Diego, y cuántas veces os tengo de echar menos!
Con esto, dejaron la ermita y picaron hacia la venta; y a poco trecho
toparon un mancebito, que delante dellos iba caminando no con mucha priesa;
y así, le alcanzaron. Llevaba la espada sobre el hombro, y en ella puesto
un bulto o envoltorio, al parecer de sus vestidos; que, al parecer, debían
de ser los calzones o greguescos, y herreruelo, y alguna camisa, porque
traía puesta una ropilla de terciopelo con algunas vislumbres de raso, y la
camisa, de fuera; las medias eran de seda, y los zapatos cuadrados, a uso
de corte; la edad llegaría a diez y ocho o diez y nueve años; alegre de
rostro, y, al parecer, ágil de su persona. Iba cantando seguidillas, para
entretener el trabajo del camino. Cuando llegaron a él, acababa de cantar
una, que el primo tomó de memoria, que dicen que decía:
A la guerra me lleva
mi necesidad;
si tuviera dineros,
no fuera, en verdad.
El primero que le habló fue don Quijote, diciéndole:
— Muy a la ligera camina vuesa merced, señor galán. Y ¿adónde bueno?
Sepamos, si es que gusta decirlo.
A lo que el mozo respondió:
— El caminar tan a la ligera lo causa el calor y la pobreza, y el adónde voy
es a la guerra.
— ¿Cómo la pobreza? —preguntó don Quijote—; que por el calor bien puede ser.
— Señor —replicó el mancebo—, yo llevo en este envoltorio unos greguescos de
terciopelo, compañeros desta ropilla; si los gasto en el camino, no me
podré honrar con ellos en la ciudad, y no tengo con qué comprar otros; y,
así por esto como por orearme, voy desta manera, hasta alcanzar unas
compañías de infantería que no están doce leguas de aquí, donde asentaré mi
plaza, y no faltarán bagajes en que caminar de allí adelante hasta el
embarcadero, que dicen ha de ser en Cartagena. Y más quiero tener por amo y
por señor al rey, y servirle en la guerra, que no a un pelón en la corte.
— Y ¿lleva vuesa merced alguna ventaja por ventura? —preguntó el primo.
— Si yo hubiera servido a algún grande de España, o algún principal
personaje —respondió el mozo—, a buen seguro que yo la llevara, que eso
tiene el servir a los buenos: que del tinelo suelen salir a ser alférez o
capitanes, o con algún buen entretenimiento; pero yo, desventurado, serví
siempre a catarriberas y a gente advenediza, de ración y quitación tan
mísera y atenuada, que en pagar el almidonar un cuello se consumía la mitad
della; y sería tenido a milagro que un paje aventurero alcanzase alguna
siquiera razonable ventura.
— Y dígame, por su vida, amigo —preguntó don Quijote—: ¿es posible que en
los años que sirvió no ha podido alcanzar alguna librea?
— Dos me han dado —respondió el paje—; pero, así como el que se sale de
alguna religión antes de profesar le quitan el hábito y le vuelven sus
vestidos, así me volvían a mí los míos mis amos, que, acabados los negocios
a que venían a la corte, se volvían a sus casas y recogían las libreas que
por sola ostentación habían dado.
— Notable espilorchería, como dice el italiano —dijo don Quijote—; pero, con
todo eso, tenga a felice ventura el haber salido de la corte con tan buena
intención como lleva; porque no hay otra cosa en la tierra más honrada ni
de más provecho que servir a Dios, primeramente, y luego, a su rey y señor
natural, especialmente en el ejercicio de las armas, por las cuales se
alcanzan, si no más riquezas, a lo menos, más honra que por las letras,
como yo tengo dicho muchas veces; que, puesto que han fundado más
mayorazgos las letras que las armas, todavía llevan un no sé qué los de las
armas a los de las letras, con un sí sé qué de esplendor que se halla en
ellos, que los aventaja a todos. Y esto que ahora le quiero decir llévelo
en la memoria, que le será de mucho provecho y alivio en sus trabajos; y es
que, aparte la imaginación de los sucesos adversos que le podrán venir, que
el peor de todos es la muerte, y como ésta sea buena, el mejor de todos es
el morir. Preguntáronle a Julio César, aquel valeroso emperador romano,
cuál era la mejor muerte; respondió que la impensada, la de repente y no
prevista; y, aunque respondió como gentil y ajeno del conocimiento del
verdadero Dios, con todo eso, dijo bien, para ahorrarse del sentimiento
humano; que, puesto caso que os maten en la primera facción y refriega, o
ya de un tiro de artillería, o volado de una mina, ¿qué importa? Todo es
morir, y acabóse la obra; y, según Terencio, más bien parece el soldado
muerto en la batalla que vivo y salvo en la huida; y tanto alcanza de fama
el buen soldado cuanto tiene de obediencia a sus capitanes y a los que
mandarle pueden. Y advertid, hijo, que al soldado mejor le está el oler a
pólvora que algalia, y que si la vejez os coge en este honroso ejercicio,
aunque sea lleno de heridas y estropeado o cojo, a lo menos no os podrá
coger sin honra, y tal, que no os la podrá menoscabar la pobreza; cuanto
más, que ya se va dando orden cómo se entretengan y remedien los soldados
viejos y estropeados, porque no es bien que se haga con ellos lo que suelen
hacer los que ahorran y dan libertad a sus negros cuando ya son viejos y no
pueden servir, y, echándolos de casa con título de libres, los hacen
esclavos de la hambre, de quien no piensan ahorrarse sino con la muerte. Y
por ahora no os quiero decir más, sino que subáis a las ancas deste mi
caballo hasta la venta, y allí cenaréis conmigo, y por la mañana seguiréis
el camino, que os le dé Dios tan bueno como vuestros deseos merecen.
El paje no aceptó el convite de las ancas, aunque sí el de cenar con él en
la venta; y, a esta sazón, dicen que dijo Sancho entre sí:
— ¡Válate Dios por señor! Y ¿es posible que hombre que sabe decir tales,
tantas y tan buenas cosas como aquí ha dicho, diga que ha visto los
disparates imposibles que cuenta de la cueva de Montesinos? Ahora bien,
ello dirá.
Y en esto, llegaron a la venta, a tiempo que anochecía, y no sin gusto de
Sancho, por ver que su señor la juzgó por verdadera venta, y no por
castillo, como solía. No hubieron bien entrado, cuando don Quijote preguntó
al ventero por el hombre de las lanzas y alabardas; el cual le respondió
que en la caballeriza estaba acomodando el macho. Lo mismo hicieron de sus
jumentos el primo y Sancho, dando a Rocinante el mejor pesebre y el mejor
lugar de la caballeriza.
Capítulo XXV. Donde se apunta la aventura del rebuzno y la graciosa del
titerero, con las memorables adivinanzas del mono adivino
No se le cocía el pan a don Quijote, como suele decirse, hasta oír y saber
las maravillas prometidas del hombre condutor de las armas. Fuele a buscar
donde el ventero le había dicho que estaba, y hallóle, y díjole que en todo
caso le dijese luego lo que le había de decir después, acerca de lo que le
había preguntado en el camino. El hombre le respondió:
— Más despacio, y no en pie, se ha de tomar el cuento de mis maravillas:
déjeme vuestra merced, señor bueno, acabar de dar recado a mi bestia, que
yo le diré cosas que le admiren.
— No quede por eso —respondió don Quijote—, que yo os ayudaré a todo.
Y así lo hizo, ahechándole la cebada y limpiando el pesebre, humildad que
obligó al hombre a contarle con buena voluntad lo que le pedía; y,
sentándose en un poyo y don Quijote junto a él, teniendo por senado y
auditorio al primo, al paje, a Sancho Panza y al ventero, comenzó a decir
desta manera:
— «Sabrán vuesas mercedes que en un lugar que está cuatro leguas y media
desta venta sucedió que a un regidor dél, por industria y engaño de una
muchacha criada suya, y esto es largo de contar, le faltó un asno, y,
aunque el tal regidor hizo las diligencias posibles por hallarle, no fue
posible. Quince días serían pasados, según es pública voz y fama,— que el
asno faltaba, cuando, estando en la plaza el regidor perdidoso, otro
regidor del mismo pueblo le dijo: ''Dadme albricias, compadre, que vuestro
jumento ha parecido''. ''Yo os las mando y buenas, compadre —respondió el
otro—, pero sepamos dónde ha parecido''. ''En el monte —respondió el
hallador—, le vi esta mañana, sin albarda y sin aparejo alguno, y tan flaco
que era una compasión miralle. Quísele antecoger delante de mí y traérosle,
pero está ya tan montaraz y tan huraño, que, cuando llegé a él, se fue
huyendo y se entró en lo más escondido del monte. Si queréis que volvamos
los dos a buscarle, dejadme poner esta borrica en mi casa, que luego
vuelvo''. ''Mucho placer me haréis —dijo el del jumento—, e yo procuraré
pagároslo en la mesma moneda''. Con estas circunstancias todas, y de la
mesma manera que yo lo voy contando, lo cuentan todos aquellos que están
enterados en la verdad deste caso. En resolución, los dos regidores, a pie
y mano a mano, se fueron al monte, y, llegando al lugar y sitio donde
pensaron hallar el asno, no le hallaron, ni pareció por todos aquellos
contornos, aunque más le buscaron. Viendo, pues, que no parecía, dijo el
regidor que le había visto al otro: ''Mirad, compadre: una traza me ha
venido al pensamiento, con la cual sin duda alguna podremos descubrir este
animal, aunque esté metido en las entrañas de la tierra, no que del monte;
y es que yo sé rebuznar maravillosamente; y si vos sabéis algún tanto, dad
el hecho por concluido''. ''¿Algún tanto decís, compadre? —dijo el otro—;
por Dios, que no dé la ventaja a nadie, ni aun a los mesmos asnos''.
''Ahora lo veremos —respondió el regidor segundo—, porque tengo determinado
que os vais vos por una parte del monte y yo por otra, de modo que le
rodeemos y andemos todo, y de trecho en trecho rebuznaréis vos y rebuznaré
yo, y no podrá ser menos sino que el asno nos oya y nos responda, si es que
está en el monte''. A lo que respondió el dueño del jumento: ''Digo,
compadre, que la traza es excelente y digna de vuestro gran ingenio''. Y,
dividiéndose los dos según el acuerdo, sucedió que casi a un mesmo tiempo
rebuznaron, y cada uno engañado del rebuzno del otro, acudieron a buscarse,
pensando que ya el jumento había parecido; y, en viéndose, dijo el
perdidoso: ''¿Es posible, compadre, que no fue mi asno el que rebuznó?''
''No fue, sino yo'', respondió el otro. ''Ahora digo —dijo el dueño—, que
de vos a un asno, compadre, no hay alguna diferencia, en cuanto toca al
rebuznar, porque en mi vida he visto ni oído cosa más propia''. ''Esas
alabanzas y encarecimiento —respondió el de la traza—, mejor os atañen y
tocan a vos que a mí, compadre; que por el Dios que me crió que podéis dar
dos rebuznos de ventaja al mayor y más perito rebuznador del mundo; porque
el sonido que tenéis es alto; lo sostenido de la voz, a su tiempo y compás;
los dejos, muchos y apresurados, y, en resolución, yo me doy por vencido y
os rindo la palma y doy la bandera desta rara habilidad''. ''Ahora digo
— respondió el dueño—, que me tendré y estimaré en más de aquí adelante, y
pensaré que sé alguna cosa, pues tengo alguna gracia; que, puesto que
pensara que rebuznaba bien, nunca entendí que llegaba el estremo que
decís''. ''También diré yo ahora —respondió el segundo— que hay raras
habilidades perdidas en el mundo, y que son mal empleadas en aquellos que
no saben aprovecharse dellas''. ''Las nuestras —respondió el dueño—, si no
es en casos semejantes como el que traemos entre manos, no nos pueden
servir en otros, y aun en éste plega a Dios que nos sean de provecho''.
Esto dicho, se tornaron a dividir y a volver a sus rebuznos, y a cada paso
se engañaban y volvían a juntarse, hasta que se dieron por contraseño que,
para entender que eran ellos, y no el asno, rebuznasen dos veces, una tras
otra. Con esto, doblando a cada paso los rebuznos, rodearon todo el monte
sin que el perdido jumento respondiese, ni aun por señas. Mas, ¿cómo había
de responder el pobre y mal logrado, si le hallaron en lo más escondido del
bosque, comido de lobos? Y, en viéndole, dijo su dueño: ''Ya me maravillaba
yo de que él no respondía, pues a no estar muerto, él rebuznara si nos
oyera, o no fuera asno; pero, a trueco de haberos oído rebuznar con tanta
gracia, compadre, doy por bien empleado el trabajo que he tenido en
buscarle, aunque le he hallado muerto''. ''En buena mano está, compadre
— respondió el otro—, pues si bien canta el abad, no le va en zaga el
monacillo''. Con esto, desconsolados y roncos, se volvieron a su aldea,
adonde contaron a sus amigos, vecinos y conocidos cuanto les había
acontecido en la busca del asno, exagerando el uno la gracia del otro en el
rebuznar; todo lo cual se supo y se estendió por los lugares circunvecinos.
Y el diablo, que no duerme, como es amigo de sembrar y derramar rencillas y
discordia por doquiera, levantando caramillos en el viento y grandes
quimeras de nonada, ordenó e hizo que las gentes de los otros pueblos, en
viendo a alguno de nuestra aldea, rebuznase, como dándoles en rostro con el
rebuzno de nuestros regidores. Dieron en ello los muchachos, que fue dar en
manos y en bocas de todos los demonios del infierno, y fue cundiendo el
rebuzno de en uno en otro pueblo, de manera que son conocidos los naturales
del pueblo del rebuzno, como son conocidos y diferenciados los negros de
los blancos; y ha llegado a tanto la desgracia desta burla, que muchas
veces con mano armada y formado escuadrón han salido contra los burladores
los burlados a darse la batalla, sin poderlo remediar rey ni roque, ni
temor ni vergüenza. Yo creo que mañana o esotro día han de salir en campaña
los de mi pueblo, que son los del rebuzno, contra otro lugar que está a dos
leguas del nuestro, que es uno de los que más nos persiguen: y, por salir
bien apercebidos, llevo compradas estas lanzas y alabardas que habéis
visto.» Y éstas son las maravillas que dije que os había de contar, y si no
os lo han parecido, no sé otras.
Y con esto dio fin a su plática el buen hombre; y, en esto, entró por la
puerta de la venta un hombre todo vestido de camuza, medias, greguescos y
jubón, y con voz levantada dijo:
— Señor huésped, ¿hay posada? Que viene aquí el mono adivino y el retablo de
la libertad de Melisendra.
— ¡Cuerpo de tal —dijo el ventero—, que aquí está el señor mase Pedro! Buena
noche se nos apareja.
Olvidábaseme de decir como el tal mase Pedro traía cubierto el ojo
izquierdo, y casi medio carrillo, con un parche de tafetán verde, señal que
todo aquel lado debía de estar enfermo; y el ventero prosiguió, diciendo:
— Sea bien venido vuestra merced, señor mase Pedro. ¿Adónde está el mono y
el retablo, que no los veo?
— Ya llegan cerca —respondió el todo camuza—, sino que yo me he adelantado,
a saber si hay posada.
— Al mismo duque de Alba se la quitara para dársela al señor mase Pedro
— respondió el ventero—; llegue el mono y el retablo, que gente hay esta
noche en la venta que pagará el verle y las habilidades del mono.
— Sea en buen hora —respondió el del parche—, que yo moderaré el precio, y
con sola la costa me daré por bien pagado; y yo vuelvo a hacer que camine
la carreta donde viene el mono y el retablo.
Y luego se volvió a salir de la venta.
Preguntó luego don Quijote al ventero qué mase Pedro era aquél, y qué
retablo y qué mono traía. A lo que respondió el ventero:
— Éste es un famoso titerero, que ha muchos días que anda por esta Mancha de
Aragón enseñando un retablo de Melisendra, libertada por el famoso don
Gaiferos, que es una de las mejores y más bien representadas historias que
de muchos años a esta parte en este reino se han visto. Trae asimismo
consigo un mono de la más rara habilidad que se vio entre monos, ni se
imaginó entre hombres, porque si le preguntan algo, está atento a lo que le
preguntan y luego salta sobre los hombros de su amo, y, llegándosele al
oído, le dice la respuesta de lo que le preguntan, y maese Pedro la declara
luego; y de las cosas pasadas dice mucho más que de las que están por
venir; y, aunque no todas veces acierta en todas, en las más no yerra, de
modo que nos hace creer que tiene el diablo en el cuerpo. Dos reales lleva
por cada pregunta, si es que el mono responde; quiero decir, si responde el
amo por él, después de haberle hablado al oído; y así, se cree que el tal
maese Pedro esta riquísimo; y es hombre galante, como dicen en Italia y bon
compaño, y dase la mejor vida del mundo; habla más que seis y bebe más que
doce, todo a costa de su lengua y de su mono y de su retablo.
En esto, volvió maese Pedro, y en una carreta venía el retablo, y el mono,
grande y sin cola, con las posaderas de fieltro, pero no de mala cara; y,
apenas le vio don Quijote, cuando le preguntó:
— Dígame vuestra merced, señor adivino: ¿qué peje pillamo? ¿Qué ha de ser de
nosotros?. Y vea aquí mis dos reales.
Y mandó a Sancho que se los diese a maese Pedro, el cual respondió por el
mono, y dijo:
— Señor, este animal no responde ni da noticia de las cosas que están por
venir; de las pasadas sabe algo, y de las presentes, algún tanto.
— ¡Voto a Rus —dijo Sancho—, no dé yo un ardite porque me digan lo que por
mí ha pasado!; porque, ¿quién lo puede saber mejor que yo mesmo? Y pagar yo
porque me digan lo que sé, sería una gran necedad; pero, pues sabe las
cosas presentes, he aquí mis dos reales, y dígame el señor monísimo qué
hace ahora mi mujer Teresa Panza, y en qué se entretiene.
No quiso tomar maese Pedro el dinero, diciendo:
— No quiero recebir adelantados los premios, sin que hayan precedido los
servicios.
Y, dando con la mano derecha dos golpes sobre el hombro izquierdo, en un
brinco se le puso el mono en él, y, llegando la boca al oído, daba diente
con diente muy apriesa; y, habiendo hecho este ademán por espacio de un
credo, de otro brinco se puso en el suelo, y al punto, con grandísima
priesa, se fue maese Pedro a poner de rodillas ante don Quijote, y,
abrazándole las piernas, dijo:
— Estas piernas abrazo, bien así como si abrazara las dos colunas de
Hércules, ¡oh resucitador insigne de la ya puesta en olvido andante
caballería!; ¡oh no jamás como se debe alabado caballero don Quijote de la
Mancha, ánimo de los desmayados, arrimo de los que van a caer, brazo de los
caídos, báculo y consuelo de todos los desdichados!
Quedó pasmado don Quijote, absorto Sancho, suspenso el primo, atónito el
paje, abobado el del rebuzno, confuso el ventero, y, finalmente, espantados
todos los que oyeron las razones del titerero, el cual prosiguió diciendo:
— Y tú, ¡oh buen Sancho Panza!, el mejor escudero y del mejor caballero del
mundo, alégrate, que tu buena mujer Teresa está buena, y ésta es la hora en
que ella está rastrillando una libra de lino, y, por más señas, tiene a su
lado izquierdo un jarro desbocado que cabe un buen porqué de vino, con que
se entretiene en su trabajo.
— Eso creo yo muy bien —respondió Sancho—, porque es ella una
bienaventurada, y, a no ser celosa, no la trocara yo por la giganta
Andandona, que, según mi señor, fue una mujer muy cabal y muy de pro; y es
mi Teresa de aquellas que no se dejan mal pasar, aunque sea a costa de sus
herederos.
— Ahora digo —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, que el que lee mucho y anda
mucho, vee mucho y sabe mucho. Digo esto porque, ¿qué persuasión fuera
bastante para persuadirme que hay monos en el mundo que adivinen, como lo
he visto ahora por mis propios ojos? Porque yo soy el mesmo don Quijote de
la Mancha que este buen animal ha dicho, puesto que se ha estendido algún
tanto en mis alabanzas; pero comoquiera que yo me sea, doy gracias al
cielo, que me dotó de un ánimo blando y compasivo, inclinado siempre a
hacer bien a todos, y mal a ninguno.
— Si yo tuviera dineros —dijo el paje—, preguntara al señor mono qué me ha
de suceder en la peregrinación que llevo.
A lo que respondió maese Pedro, que ya se había levantado de los pies de
don Quijote:
— Ya he dicho que esta bestezuela no responde a lo por venir; que si
respondiera, no importara no haber dineros; que, por servicio del señor don
Quijote, que está presente, dejara yo todos los intereses del mundo. Y
agora, porque se lo debo, y por darle gusto, quiero armar mi retablo y dar
placer a cuantos están en la venta, sin paga alguna.
Oyendo lo cual el ventero, alegre sobremanera, señaló el lugar donde se
podía poner el retablo, que en un punto fue hecho.
Don Quijote no estaba muy contento con las adivinanzas del mono, por
parecerle no ser a propósito que un mono adivinase, ni las de por venir, ni
las pasadas cosas; y así, en tanto que maese Pedro acomodaba el retablo, se
retiró don Quijote con Sancho a un rincón de la caballeriza, donde, sin ser
oídos de nadie, le dijo:
— Mira, Sancho, yo he considerado bien la estraña habilidad deste mono, y
hallo por mi cuenta que sin duda este maese Pedro, su amo, debe de tener
hecho pacto, tácito o espreso, con el demonio.
— Si el patio es espeso y del demonio —dijo Sancho—, sin duda debe de ser
muy sucio patio; pero, ¿de qué provecho le es al tal maese Pedro tener esos
patios?
— No me entiendes, Sancho: no quiero decir sino que debe de tener hecho
algún concierto con el demonio de que infunda esa habilidad en el mono, con
que gane de comer, y después que esté rico le dará su alma, que es lo que
este universal enemigo pretende. Y háceme creer esto el ver que el mono no
responde sino a las cosas pasadas o presentes, y la sabiduría del diablo no
se puede estender a más, que las por venir no las sabe si no es por
conjeturas, y no todas veces; que a solo Dios está reservado conocer los
tiempos y los momentos, y para Él no hay pasado ni porvenir, que todo es
presente. Y, siendo esto así, como lo es, está claro que este mono habla
con el estilo del diablo; y estoy maravillado cómo no le han acusado al
Santo Oficio, y examinádole y sacádole de cuajo en virtud de quién adivina;
porque cierto está que este mono no es astrólogo, ni su amo ni él alzan, ni
saben alzar, estas figuras que llaman judiciarias, que tanto ahora se usan
en España, que no hay mujercilla, ni paje, ni zapatero de viejo que no
presuma de alzar una figura, como si fuera una sota de naipes del suelo,
echando a perder con sus mentiras e ignorancias la verdad maravillosa de la
ciencia. De una señora sé yo que preguntó a uno destos figureros que si una
perrilla de falda pequeña, que tenía, si se empreñaría y pariría, y cuántos
y de qué color serían los perros que pariese. A lo que el señor judiciario,
después de haber alzado la figura, respondió que la perrica se empreñaría,
y pariría tres perricos, el uno verde, el otro encarnado y el otro de
mezcla, con tal condición que la tal perra se cubriese entre las once y
doce del día, o de la noche, y que fuese en lunes o en sábado; y lo que
sucedió fue que de allí a dos días se moría la perra de ahíta, y el señor
levantador quedó acreditado en el lugar por acertadísimo judiciario, como
lo quedan todos o los más levantadores.
— Con todo eso, querría —dijo Sancho— que vuestra merced dijese a maese
Pedro preguntase a su mono si es verdad lo que a vuestra merced le pasó en
la cueva de Montesinos; que yo para mí tengo, con perdón de vuestra merced,
que todo fue embeleco y mentira, o por lo menos, cosas soñadas.
— Todo podría ser —respondió don Quijote—, pero yo haré lo que me aconsejas,
puesto que me ha de quedar un no sé qué de escrúpulo.
Estando en esto, llegó maese Pedro a buscar a don Quijote y decirle que ya
estaba en orden el retablo; que su merced viniese a verle, porque lo
merecía. Don Quijote le comunicó su pensamiento, y le rogó preguntase luego
a su mono le dijese si ciertas cosas que había pasado en la cueva de
Montesinos habían sido soñadas o verdaderas; porque a él le parecía que
tenían de todo. A lo que maese Pedro, sin responder palabra, volvió a traer
el mono, y, puesto delante de don Quijote y de Sancho, dijo:
— Mirad, señor mono, que este caballero quiere saber si ciertas cosas que le
pasaron en una cueva llamada de Montesinos, si fueron falsas o verdaderas.
Y, haciéndole la acostumbrada señal, el mono se le subió en el hombro
izquierdo, y, hablándole, al parecer, en el oído, dijo luego maese Pedro:
— El mono dice que parte de las cosas que vuesa merced vio, o pasó, en la
dicha cueva son falsas, y parte verisímiles; y que esto es lo que sabe, y
no otra cosa, en cuanto a esta pregunta; y que si vuesa merced quisiere
saber más, que el viernes venidero responderá a todo lo que se le
preguntare, que por ahora se le ha acabado la virtud, que no le vendrá
hasta el viernes, como dicho tiene.
— ¿No lo decía yo —dijo Sancho—, que no se me podía asentar que todo lo que
vuesa merced, señor mío, ha dicho de los acontecimientos de la cueva era
verdad, ni aun la mitad?
— Los sucesos lo dirán, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—; que el tiempo,
descubridor de todas las cosas, no se deja ninguna que no las saque a la
luz del sol, aunque esté escondida en los senos de la tierra. Y, por hora,
baste esto, y vámonos a ver el retablo del buen maese Pedro, que para mí
tengo que debe de tener alguna novedad.
— ¿Cómo alguna? —respondió maese Pedro—: sesenta mil encierra en sí este mi
retablo; dígole a vuesa merced, mi señor don Quijote, que es una de las
cosas más de ver que hoy tiene el mundo, y operibus credite, et non verbis;
y manos a labor, que se hace tarde y tenemos mucho que hacer y que decir y
que mostrar.
Obedeciéronle don Quijote y Sancho, y vinieron donde ya estaba el retablo
puesto y descubierto, lleno por todas partes de candelillas de cera
encendidas, que le hacían vistoso y resplandeciente. En llegando, se metió
maese Pedro dentro dél, que era el que había de manejar las figuras del
artificio, y fuera se puso un muchacho, criado del maese Pedro, para servir
de intérprete y declarador de los misterios del tal retablo: tenía una
varilla en la mano, con que señalaba las figuras que salían.
Puestos, pues, todos cuantos había en la venta, y algunos en pie, frontero
del retablo, y acomodados don Quijote, Sancho, el paje y el primo en los
mejores lugares, el trujamán comenzó a decir lo que oirá y verá el que le
oyere o viere el capítulo siguiente.
Capítulo XXVI. Donde se prosigue la graciosa aventura del titerero, con
otras cosas en verdad harto buenas
Callaron todos, tirios y troyanos; quiero decir, pendientes estaban todos
los que el retablo miraban de la boca del declarador de sus maravillas,
cuando se oyeron sonar en el retablo cantidad de atabales y trompetas, y
dispararse mucha artillería, cuyo rumor pasó en tiempo breve, y luego alzó
la voz el muchacho, y dijo:
— Esta verdadera historia que aquí a vuesas mercedes se representa es sacada
al pie de la letra de las corónicas francesas y de los romances españoles
que andan en boca de las gentes, y de los muchachos, por esas calles. Trata
de la libertad que dio el señor don Gaiferos a su esposa Melisendra, que
estaba cautiva en España, en poder de moros, en la ciudad de Sansueña, que
así se llamaba entonces la que hoy se llama Zaragoza; y vean vuesas
mercedes allí cómo está jugando a las tablas don Gaiferos, según aquello
que se canta:
Jugando está a las tablas don Gaiferos,
que ya de Melisendra está olvidado.
Y aquel personaje que allí asoma, con corona en la cabeza y ceptro en las
manos, es el emperador Carlomagno, padre putativo de la tal Melisendra, el
cual, mohíno de ver el ocio y descuido de su yerno, le sale a reñir; y
adviertan con la vehemencia y ahínco que le riñe, que no parece sino que le
quiere dar con el ceptro media docena de coscorrones, y aun hay autores que
dicen que se los dio, y muy bien dados; y, después de haberle dicho muchas
cosas acerca del peligro que corría su honra en no procurar la libertad de
su esposa, dicen que le dijo:
"Harto os he dicho: miradlo".
Miren vuestras mercedes también cómo el emperador vuelve las espaldas y
deja despechado a don Gaiferos, el cual ya ven como arroja, impaciente de
la cólera, lejos de sí el tablero y las tablas, y pide apriesa las armas, y
a don Roldán, su primo, pide prestada su espada Durindana, y cómo don
Roldán no se la quiere prestar, ofreciéndole su compañía en la difícil
empresa en que se pone; pero el valeroso enojado no lo quiere aceptar;
antes, dice que él solo es bastante para sacar a su esposa, si bien
estuviese metida en el más hondo centro de la tierra; y, con esto, se entra
a armar, para ponerse luego en camino. Vuelvan vuestras mercedes los ojos a
aquella torre que allí parece, que se presupone que es una de las torres
del alcázar de Zaragoza, que ahora llaman la Aljafería; y aquella dama que
en aquel balcón parece, vestida a lo moro, es la sin par Melisendra, que
desde allí muchas veces se ponía a mirar el camino de Francia, y, puesta la
imaginación en París y en su esposo, se consolaba en su cautiverio. Miren
también un nuevo caso que ahora sucede, quizá no visto jamás. ¿No veen
aquel moro que callandico y pasito a paso, puesto el dedo en la boca, se
llega por las espaldas de Melisendra? Pues miren cómo la da un beso en
mitad de los labios, y la priesa que ella se da a escupir, y a limpiárselos
con la blanca manga de su camisa, y cómo se lamenta, y se arranca de pesar
sus hermosos cabellos, como si ellos tuvieran la culpa del maleficio. Miren
también cómo aquel grave moro que está en aquellos corredores es el rey
Marsilio de Sansueña; el cual, por haber visto la insolencia del moro,
puesto que era un pariente y gran privado suyo, le mandó luego prender, y
que le den docientos azotes, llevándole por las calles acostumbradas de la
ciudad,
con chilladores delante
y envaramiento detrás;
y veis aquí donde salen a ejecutar la sentencia, aun bien apenas no
habiendo sido puesta en ejecución la culpa; porque entre moros no hay
"traslado a la parte", ni "a prueba y estése", como entre nosotros.
— Niño, niño —dijo con voz alta a esta sazón don Quijote—, seguid vuestra
historia línea recta, y no os metáis en las curvas o transversales; que,
para sacar una verdad en limpio, menester son muchas pruebas y repruebas.
También dijo maese Pedro desde dentro:
— Muchacho, no te metas en dibujos, sino haz lo que ese señor te manda, que
será lo más acertado; sigue tu canto llano, y no te metas en contrapuntos,
que se suelen quebrar de sotiles.
— Yo lo haré así —respondió el muchacho; y prosiguió, diciendo—: Esta figura
que aquí parece a caballo, cubierta con una capa gascona, es la mesma de
don Gaiferos, a quien su esposa, ya vengada del atrevimiento del enamorado
moro, con mejor y más sosegado semblante, se ha puesto a los miradores de
la torre, y habla con su esposo, creyendo que es algún pasajero, con quien
pasó todas aquellas razones y coloquios de aquel romance que dicen:
Caballero, si a Francia ides,
por Gaiferos preguntad;
las cuales no digo yo ahora, porque de la prolijidad se suele engendrar el
fastidio; basta ver cómo don Gaiferos se descubre, y que por los ademanes
alegres que Melisendra hace se nos da a entender que ella le ha conocido, y
más ahora que veemos se descuelga del balcón, para ponerse en las ancas del
caballo de su buen esposo. Mas, ¡ay, sin ventura!, que se le ha asido una
punta del faldellín de uno de los hierros del balcón, y está pendiente en
el aire, sin poder llegar al suelo. Pero veis cómo el piadoso cielo socorre
en las mayores necesidades, pues llega don Gaiferos, y, sin mirar si se
rasgará o no el rico faldellín, ase della, y mal su grado la hace bajar al
suelo, y luego, de un brinco, la pone sobre las ancas de su caballo, a
horcajadas como hombre, y la manda que se tenga fuertemente y le eche los
brazos por las espaldas, de modo que los cruce en el pecho, porque no se
caiga, a causa que no estaba la señora Melisendra acostumbrada a semejantes
caballerías. Veis también cómo los relinchos del caballo dan señales que va
contento con la valiente y hermosa carga que lleva en su señor y en su
señora. Veis cómo vuelven las espaldas y salen de la ciudad, y alegres y
regocijados toman de París la vía. ¡Vais en paz, oh par sin par de
verdaderos amantes! ¡Lleguéis a salvamento a vuestra deseada patria, sin
que la fortuna ponga estorbo en vuestro felice viaje! ¡Los ojos de vuestros
amigos y parientes os vean gozar en paz tranquila los días, que los de
Néstor sean, que os quedan de la vida!
Aquí alzó otra vez la voz maese Pedro, y dijo:
— Llaneza, muchacho; no te encumbres, que toda afectación es mala.
No respondió nada el intérprete; antes, prosiguió, diciendo:
— No faltaron algunos ociosos ojos, que lo suelen ver todo, que no viesen la
bajada y la subida de Melisendra, de quien dieron noticia al rey Marsilio,
el cual mandó luego tocar al arma; y miren con qué priesa, que ya la ciudad
se hunde con el son de las campanas que en todas las torres de las
mezquitas suenan.
— ¡Eso no! —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—: en esto de las campanas anda muy
impropio maese Pedro, porque entre moros no se usan campanas, sino
atabales, y un género de dulzainas que parecen nuestras chirimías; y esto
de sonar campanas en Sansueña sin duda que es un gran disparate.
Lo cual oído por maese Pedro, cesó el tocar y dijo:
— No mire vuesa merced en niñerías, señor don Quijote, ni quiera llevar las
cosas tan por el cabo que no se le halle. ¿No se representan por ahí, casi
de ordinario, mil comedias llenas de mil impropiedades y disparates, y, con
todo eso, corren felicísimamente su carrera, y se escuchan no sólo con
aplauso, sino con admiración y todo? Prosigue, muchacho, y deja decir; que,
como yo llene mi talego, si quiere represente más impropiedades que tiene
átomos el sol.
— Así es la verdad —replicó don Quijote.
Y el muchacho dijo:
— Miren cuánta y cuán lucida caballería sale de la ciudad en siguimiento de
los dos católicos amantes, cuántas trompetas que suenan, cuántas dulzainas
que tocan y cuántos atabales y atambores que retumban. Témome que los han
de alcanzar, y los han de volver atados a la cola de su mismo caballo, que
sería un horrendo espetáculo.
Viendo y oyendo, pues, tanta morisma y tanto estruendo don Quijote,
parecióle ser bien dar ayuda a los que huían; y, levantándose en pie, en
voz alta, dijo:
— No consentiré yo en mis días y en mi presencia se le haga superchería a
tan famoso caballero y a tan atrevido enamorado como don Gaiferos.
¡Deteneos, mal nacida canalla; no le sigáis ni persigáis; si no, conmigo
sois en la batalla!
Y, diciendo y haciendo, desenvainó la espada, y de un brinco se puso junto
al retablo, y, con acelerada y nunca vista furia, comenzó a llover
cuchilladas sobre la titerera morisma, derribando a unos, descabezando a
otros, estropeando a éste, destrozando a aquél, y, entre otros muchos, tiró
un altibajo tal, que si maese Pedro no se abaja, se encoge y agazapa, le
cercenara la cabeza con más facilidad que si fuera hecha de masa de
mazapán. Daba voces maese Pedro, diciendo:
— Deténgase vuesa merced, señor don Quijote, y advierta que estos que
derriba, destroza y mata no son verdaderos moros, sino unas figurillas de
pasta. ¡Mire, pecador de mí, que me destruye y echa a perder toda mi
hacienda!
Mas no por esto dejaba de menudear don Quijote cuchilladas, mandobles,
tajos y reveses como llovidos. Finalmente, en menos de dos credos dio con
todo el retablo en el suelo, hechas pedazos y desmenuzadas todas sus
jarcias y figuras: el rey Marsilio, mal herido, y el emperador Carlomagno,
partida la corona y la cabeza en dos partes. Alborotóse el senado de los
oyentes, huyóse el mono por los tejados de la ventana, temió el primo,
acobardóse el paje, y hasta el mesmo Sancho Panza tuvo pavor grandísimo,
porque, como él juró después de pasada la borrasca, jamás había visto a su
señor con tan desatinada cólera. Hecho, pues, el general destrozo del
retablo, sosegóse un poco don Quijote y dijo:
— Quisiera yo tener aquí delante en este punto todos aquellos que no creen,
ni quieren creer, de cuánto provecho sean en el mundo los caballeros
andantes: miren, si no me hallara yo aquí presente, qué fuera del buen don
Gaiferos y de la hermosa Melisendra; a buen seguro que ésta fuera ya la
hora que los hubieran alcanzado estos canes, y les hubieran hecho algún
desaguisado. En resolución, ¡viva la andante caballería sobre cuantas cosas
hoy viven en la tierra!
— ¡Vivan en hora buena —dijo a esta sazón con voz enfermiza maese Pedro—, y
muera yo, pues soy tan desdichado que puedo decir con el rey don Rodrigo:
Ayer fui señor de España...
y hoy no tengo una almena
que pueda decir que es mía!
No ha media hora, ni aun un mediano momento, que me vi señor de reyes y de
emperadores, llenas mis caballerizas y mis cofres y sacos de infinitos
caballos y de innumerables galas, y agora me veo desolado y abatido, pobre
y mendigo, y, sobre todo, sin mi mono, que a fe que primero que le vuelva a
mi poder me han de sudar los dientes; y todo por la furia mal considerada
deste señor caballero, de quien se dice que ampara pupilos, y endereza
tuertos, y hace otras obras caritativas; y en mí solo ha venido a
faltar su intención generosa, que sean benditos y alabados los cielos, allá
donde tienen más levantados sus asientos. En fin, el Caballero de la Triste
Figura había de ser aquel que había de desfigurar las mías.
Enternecióse Sancho Panza con las razones de maese Pedro, y díjole:
— No llores, maese Pedro, ni te lamentes, que me quiebras el corazón; porque
te hago saber que es mi señor don Quijote tan católico y escrupuloso
cristiano, que si él cae en la cuenta de que te ha hecho algún agravio, te
lo sabrá y te lo querrá pagar y satisfacer con muchas ventajas.
— Con que me pagase el señor don Quijote alguna parte de las hechuras que me
ha deshecho, quedaría contento, y su merced aseguraría su conciencia,
porque no se puede salvar quien tiene lo ajeno contra la voluntad de su
dueño y no lo restituye.
— Así es —dijo don Quijote—, pero hasta ahora yo no sé que tenga nada
vuestro, maese Pedro.
— ¿Cómo no? —respondió maese Pedro—; y estas reliquias que están por este
duro y estéril suelo, ¿quién las esparció y aniquiló, sino la fuerza
invencible dese poderoso brazo?, y ¿cúyos eran sus cuerpos sino míos?, y
¿con quién me sustentaba yo sino con ellos?
— Ahora acabo de creer —dijo a este punto don Quijote— lo que otras muchas
veces he creído: que estos encantadores que me persiguen no hacen sino
ponerme las figuras como ellas son delante de los ojos, y luego me las
mudan y truecan en las que ellos quieren. Real y verdaderamente os digo,
señores que me oís, que a mí me pareció todo lo que aquí ha pasado que
pasaba al pie de la letra: que Melisendra era Melisendra, don Gaiferos don
Gaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, y Carlomagno Carlomagno: por eso se me alteró
la cólera, y, por cumplir con mi profesión de caballero andante, quise dar
ayuda y favor a los que huían, y con este buen propósito hice lo que habéis
visto; si me ha salido al revés, no es culpa mía, sino de los malos que me
persiguen; y, con todo esto, deste mi yerro, aunque no ha procedido de
malicia, quiero yo mismo condenarme en costas: vea maese Pedro lo que
quiere por las figuras deshechas, que yo me ofrezco a pagárselo luego, en
buena y corriente moneda castellana.
Inclinósele maese Pedro, diciéndole:
— No esperaba yo menos de la inaudita cristiandad del valeroso don Quijote
de la Mancha, verdadero socorredor y amparo de todos los necesitados y
menesterosos vagamundos; y aquí el señor ventero y el gran Sancho serán
medianeros y apreciadores, entre vuesa merced y mí, de lo que valen o
podían valer las ya deshechas figuras.
El ventero y Sancho dijeron que así lo harían, y luego maese Pedro alzó del
suelo, con la cabeza menos, al rey Marsilio de Zaragoza, y dijo:
— Ya se vee cuán imposible es volver a este rey a su ser primero; y así, me
parece, salvo mejor juicio, que se me dé por su muerte, fin y acabamiento
cuatro reales y medio.
— ¡Adelante! —dijo don Quijote.
— Pues por esta abertura de arriba abajo —prosiguió maese Pedro, tomando en
las manos al partido emperador Carlomagno—, no sería mucho que pidiese yo
cinco reales y un cuartillo.
— No es poco —dijo Sancho.
— Ni mucho —replicó el ventero—; médiese la partida y señálensele cinco
reales.
— Dénsele todos cinco y cuartillo —dijo don Quijote—, que no está en un
cuartillo más a menos la monta desta notable desgracia; y acabe presto
maese Pedro, que se hace hora de cenar, y yo tengo ciertos barruntos de
hambre.
— Por esta figura —dijo maese Pedro— que está sin narices y un ojo menos,
que es de la hermosa Melisendra, quiero, y me pongo en lo justo, dos reales
y doce maravedís.
— Aun ahí sería el diablo —dijo don Quijote—, si ya no estuviese Melisendra
con su esposo, por lo menos, en la raya de Francia; porque el caballo en
que iban, a mí me pareció que antes volaba que corría; y así, no hay para
qué venderme a mí el gato por liebre, presentándome aquí a Melisendra
desnarigada, estando la otra, si viene a mano, ahora holgándose en Francia
con su esposo a pierna tendida. Ayude Dios con lo suyo a cada uno, señor
maese Pedro, y caminemos todos con pie llano y con intención sana. Y
prosiga.
Maese Pedro, que vio que don Quijote izquierdeaba y que volvía a su
primer tema, no quiso que se le escapase; y así, le dijo:
— Ésta no debe de ser Melisendra, sino alguna de las doncellas que la
servían; y así, con sesenta maravedís que me den por ella quedaré contento
y bien pagado.
Desta manera fue poniendo precio a otras muchas destrozadas figuras, que
después los moderaron los dos jueces árbitros, con satisfación de las
partes, que llegaron a cuarenta reales y tres cuartillos; y, además desto,
que luego lo desembolsó Sancho, pidió maese Pedro dos reales por el trabajo
de tomar el mono.
— Dáselos, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, no para tomar el mono, sino la mona; y
docientos diera yo ahora en albricias a quien me dijera con certidumbre que
la señora doña Melisendra y el señor don Gaiferos estaban ya en Francia y
entre los suyos.
— Ninguno nos lo podrá decir mejor que mi mono —dijo maese Pedro—, pero no
habrá diablo que ahora le tome; aunque imagino que el cariño y la hambre le
han de forzar a que me busque esta noche, y amanecerá Dios y verémonos.
En resolución, la borrasca del retablo se acabó y todos cenaron en paz y en
buena compañía, a costa de don Quijote, que era liberal en todo estremo.
Antes que amaneciese, se fue el que llevaba las lanzas y las alabardas, y
ya después de amanecido, se vinieron a despedir de don Quijote el primo y
el paje: el uno, para volverse a su tierra; y el otro, a proseguir su
camino, para ayuda del cual le dio don Quijote una docena de reales. Maese
Pedro no quiso volver a entrar en más dimes ni diretes con don Quijote, a
quien él conocía muy bien, y así, madrugó antes que el sol, y, cogiendo las
reliquias de su retablo y a su mono, se fue también a buscar sus aventuras.
El ventero, que no conocía a don Quijote, tan admirado le tenían sus
locuras como su liberalidad. Finalmente, Sancho le pagó muy bien, por orden
de su señor, y, despidiéndose dél, casi a las ocho del día dejaron la venta
y se pusieron en camino, donde los dejaremos ir; que así conviene para dar
lugar a contar otras cosas pertenecientes a la declaración desta famosa
historia.
Capítulo XXVII. Donde se da cuenta quiénes eran maese Pedro y su mono, con
el mal suceso que don Quijote tuvo en la aventura del rebuzno, que no la
acabó como él quisiera y como lo tenía pensado
Entra Cide Hamete, coronista desta grande historia, con estas palabras en
este capítulo: ''Juro como católico cristiano...''; a lo que su traductor
dice que el jurar Cide Hamete como católico cristiano, siendo él moro, como
sin duda lo era, no quiso decir otra cosa sino que, así como el católico
cristiano cuando jura, jura, o debe jurar, verdad, y decirla en lo que
dijere, así él la decía, como si jurara como cristiano católico, en lo que
quería escribir de don Quijote, especialmente en decir quién era maese
Pedro, y quién el mono adivino que traía admirados todos aquellos pueblos
con sus adivinanzas.
Dice, pues, que bien se acordará, el que hubiere leído la primera parte
desta historia, de aquel Ginés de Pasamonte, a quien, entre otros galeotes,
dio libertad don Quijote en Sierra Morena, beneficio que después le fue mal
agradecido y peor pagado de aquella gente maligna y mal acostumbrada. Este
Ginés de Pasamonte, a quien don Quijote llamaba Ginesillo de Parapilla, fue
el que hurtó a Sancho Panza el rucio; que, por no haberse puesto el cómo ni
el cuándo en la primera parte, por culpa de los impresores, ha dado en qué
entender a muchos, que atribuían a poca memoria del autor la falta de
emprenta. Pero, en resolución, Ginés le hurtó, estando sobre él durmiendo
Sancho Panza, usando de la traza y modo que usó Brunelo cuando, estando
Sacripante sobre Albraca, le sacó el caballo de entre las piernas, y
después le cobró Sancho, como se ha contado. Este Ginés, pues, temeroso de
no ser hallado de la justicia, que le buscaba para castigarle de sus
infinitas bellaquerías y delitos, que fueron tantos y tales, que él mismo
compuso un gran volumen contándolos, determinó pasarse al reino de Aragón y
cubrirse el ojo izquierdo, acomodándose al oficio de titerero; que esto y
el jugar de manos lo sabía hacer por estremo.
Sucedió, pues, que de unos cristianos ya libres que venían de Berbería
compró aquel mono, a quien enseñó que, en haciéndole cierta señal, se le
subiese en el hombro y le murmurase, o lo pareciese, al oído. Hecho esto,
antes que entrase en el lugar donde entraba con su retablo y mono, se
informaba en el lugar más cercano, o de quien él mejor podía, qué cosas
particulares hubiesen sucedido en el tal lugar, y a qué personas; y,
llevándolas bien en la memoria, lo primero que hacía era mostrar su
retablo, el cual unas veces era de una historia, y otras de otra; pero
todas alegres y regocijadas y conocidas. Acabada la muestra, proponía las
habilidades de su mono, diciendo al pueblo que adivinaba todo lo pasado y
lo presente; pero que en lo de por venir no se daba maña. Por la respuesta
de cada pregunta pedía dos reales, y de algunas hacía barato, según tomaba
el pulso a los preguntantes; y como tal vez llegaba a las casas de quien él
sabía los sucesos de los que en ella moraban, aunque no le preguntasen nada
por no pagarle, él hacía la seña al mono, y luego decía que le había dicho
tal y tal cosa, que venía de molde con lo sucedido. Con esto cobraba
crédito inefable, y andábanse todos tras él. Otras veces, como era tan
discreto, respondía de manera que las respuestas venían bien con las
preguntas; y, como nadie le apuraba ni apretaba a que dijese cómo adevinaba
su mono, a todos hacía monas, y llenaba sus esqueros.
Así como entró en la venta, conoció a don Quijote y a Sancho, por cuyo
conocimiento le fue fácil poner en admiración a don Quijote y a Sancho
Panza, y a todos los que en ella estaban; pero hubiérale de costar caro si
don Quijote bajara un poco más la mano cuando cortó la cabeza al rey
Marsilio y destruyó toda su caballería, como queda dicho en el antecedente
capítulo.
Esto es lo que hay que decir de maese Pedro y de su mono.
Y, volviendo a don Quijote de la Mancha, digo que, después de haber salido
de la venta, determinó de ver primero las riberas del río Ebro y todos
aquellos contornos, antes de entrar en la ciudad de Zaragoza, pues le daba
tiempo para todo el mucho que faltaba desde allí a las justas. Con esta
intención siguió su camino, por el cual anduvo dos días sin acontecerle
cosa digna de ponerse en escritura, hasta que al tercero, al subir de una
loma, oyó un gran rumor de atambores, de trompetas y arcabuces. Al
principio pensó que algún tercio de soldados pasaba por aquella parte, y
por verlos picó a Rocinante y subió la loma arriba; y cuando estuvo en la
cumbre, vio al pie della, a su parecer, más de docientos hombres armados de
diferentes suertes de armas, como si dijésemos lanzones, ballestas,
partesanas, alabardas y picas, y algunos arcabuces, y muchas rodelas. Bajó
del recuesto y acercóse al escuadrón, tanto, que distintamente vio las
banderas, juzgó de las colores y notó las empresas que en ellas traían,
especialmente una que en un estandarte o jirón de raso blanco venía, en el
cual estaba pintado muy al vivo un asno como un pequeño sardesco, la cabeza
levantada, la boca abierta y la lengua de fuera, en acto y postura como si
estuviera rebuznando; alrededor dél estaban escritos de letras grandes
estos dos versos:
No rebuznaron en balde
el uno y el otro alcalde.
Por esta insignia sacó don Quijote que aquella gente debía de ser del
pueblo del rebuzno, y así se lo dijo a Sancho, declarándole lo que en el
estandarte venía escrito. Díjole también que el que les había dado noticia
de aquel caso se había errado en decir que dos regidores habían sido los
que rebuznaron; pero que, según los versos del estandarte, no habían sido
sino alcaldes. A lo que respondió Sancho Panza:
— Señor, en eso no hay que reparar, que bien puede ser que los regidores que
entonces rebuznaron viniesen con el tiempo a ser alcaldes de su pueblo, y
así, se pueden llamar con entrambos títulos; cuanto más, que no hace al
caso a la verdad de la historia ser los rebuznadores alcaldes o regidores,
como ellos una por una hayan rebuznado; porque tan a pique está de rebuznar
un alcalde como un regidor.
Finalmente, conocieron y supieron como el pueblo corrido salía a pelear con
otro que le corría más de lo justo y de lo que se debía a la buena
vecindad.
Fuese llegando a ellos don Quijote, no con poca pesadumbre de Sancho, que
nunca fue amigo de hallarse en semejantes jornadas. Los del escuadrón le
recogieron en medio, creyendo que era alguno de los de su parcialidad. Don
Quijote, alzando la visera, con gentil brío y continente, llegó hasta el
estandarte del asno, y allí se le pusieron alrededor todos los más
principales del ejército, por verle, admirados con la admiración
acostumbrada en que caían todos aquellos que la vez primera le miraban. Don
Quijote, que los vio tan atentos a mirarle, sin que ninguno le hablase ni
le preguntase nada, quiso aprovecharse de aquel silencio, y, rompiendo el
suyo, alzó la voz y dijo:
— Buenos señores, cuan encarecidamente puedo, os suplico que no interrumpáis
un razonamiento que quiero haceros, hasta que veáis que os disgusta y
enfada; que si esto sucede, con la más mínima señal que me hagáis pondré un
sello en mi boca y echaré una mordaza a mi lengua.
Todos le dijeron que dijese lo que quisiese, que de buena gana le
escucharían. Don Quijote, con esta licencia, prosiguió diciendo:
Yo, señores míos, soy caballero andante, cuyo ejercicio es el de las armas,
y cuya profesión la de favorecer a los necesitados de favor y acudir a los
menesterosos. Días ha que he sabido vuestra desgracia y la causa que os
mueve a tomar las armas a cada paso, para vengaros de vuestros enemigos; y,
habiendo discurrido una y muchas veces en mi entendimiento sobre vuestro
negocio, hallo, según las leyes del duelo, que estáis engañados en teneros
por afrentados, porque ningún particular puede afrentar a un pueblo entero,
si no es retándole de traidor por junto, porque no sabe en particular quién
cometió la traición por que le reta. Ejemplo desto tenemos en don Diego
Ordóñez de Lara, que retó a todo el pueblo zamorano, porque ignoraba que
solo Vellido Dolfos había cometido la traición de matar a su rey; y así,
retó a todos, y a todos tocaba la venganza y la respuesta; aunque bien es
verdad que el señor don Diego anduvo algo demasiado, y aun pasó muy
adelante de los límites del reto, porque no tenía para qué retar a los
muertos, a las aguas, ni a los panes, ni a los que estaban por nacer, ni a
las otras menudencias que allí se declaran; pero, ¡vaya!, pues cuando la
cólera sale de madre, no tiene la lengua padre, ayo ni freno que la
corrija. Siendo, pues, esto así, que uno solo no puede afrentar a reino,
provincia, ciudad, república ni pueblo entero, queda en limpio que no hay
para qué salir a la venganza del reto de la tal afrenta, pues no lo es;
porque, ¡bueno sería que se matasen a cada paso los del pueblo de la Reloja
con quien se lo llama, ni los cazoleros, berenjeneros, ballenatos,
jaboneros, ni los de otros nombres y apellidos que andan por ahí en boca de
los muchachos y de gente de poco más a menos! ¡Bueno sería, por cierto, que
todos estos insignes pueblos se corriesen y vengasen, y anduviesen contino
hechas las espadas sacabuches a cualquier pendencia, por pequeña que fuese!
No, no, ni Dios lo permita o quiera. Los varones prudentes, las repúblicas
bien concertadas, por cuatro cosas han de tomar las armas y desenvainar las
espadas, y poner a riesgo sus personas, vidas y haciendas: la primera, por
defender la fe católica; la segunda, por defender su vida, que es de ley
natural y divina; la tercera, en defensa de su honra, de su familia y
hacienda; la cuarta, en servicio de su rey, en la guerra justa; y si le
quisiéremos añadir la quinta, que se puede contar por segunda, es en
defensa de su patria. A estas cinco causas, como capitales, se pueden
agregar algunas otras que sean justas y razonables, y que obliguen a tomar
las armas; pero tomarlas por niñerías y por cosas que antes son de risa y
pasatiempo que de afrenta, parece que quien las toma carece de todo
razonable discurso; cuanto más, que el tomar venganza injusta, que justa no
puede haber alguna que lo sea, va derechamente contra la santa ley que
profesamos, en la cual se nos manda que hagamos bien a nuestros enemigos y
que amemos a los que nos aborrecen; mandamiento que, aunque parece algo
dificultoso de cumplir, no lo es sino para aquellos que tienen menos de
Dios que del mundo, y más de carne que de espíritu; porque Jesucristo, Dios
y hombre verdadero, que nunca mintió, ni pudo ni puede mentir, siendo
legislador nuestro, dijo que su yugo era suave y su carga liviana; y así,
no nos había de mandar cosa que fuese imposible el cumplirla. Así que, mis
señores, vuesas mercedes están obligados por leyes divinas y humanas a
sosegarse.
— El diablo me lleve —dijo a esta sazón Sancho entre sí— si este mi amo no
es tólogo; y si no lo es, que lo parece como un güevo a otro.
Tomó un poco de aliento don Quijote, y, viendo que todavía le prestaban
silencio, quiso pasar adelante en su plática, como pasara ni no se pusiere
en medio la agudeza de Sancho, el cual, viendo que su amo se detenía, tomó
la mano por él, diciendo:
— Mi señor don Quijote de la Mancha, que un tiempo se llamó el Caballero de
la Triste Figura y ahora se llama el Caballero de los Leones, es un hidalgo
muy atentado, que sabe latín y romance como un bachiller, y en todo cuanto
trata y aconseja procede como muy buen soldado, y tiene todas las leyes y
ordenanzas de lo que llaman el duelo en la uña; y así, no hay más que hacer
sino dejarse llevar por lo que él dijere, y sobre mí si lo erraren; cuanto
más, que ello se está dicho que es necedad correrse por sólo oír un
rebuzno, que yo me acuerdo, cuando muchacho, que rebuznaba cada y cuando
que se me antojaba, sin que nadie me fuese a la mano, y con tanta gracia y
propiedad que, en rebuznando yo, rebuznaban todos los asnos del pueblo, y
no por eso dejaba de ser hijo de mis padres, que eran honradísimos; y,
aunque por esta habilidad era invidiado de más de cuatro de los estirados
de mi pueblo, no se me daba dos ardites. Y, porque se vea que digo verdad,
esperen y escuchen, que esta ciencia es como la del nadar: que, una vez
aprendida, nunca se olvida.
Y luego, puesta la mano en las narices, comenzó a rebuznar tan reciamente,
que todos los cercanos valles retumbaron. Pero uno de los que estaban junto
a él, creyendo que hacía burla dellos, alzó un varapalo que en la mano
tenía, y diole tal golpe con él, que, sin ser poderoso a otra cosa, dio con
Sancho Panza en el suelo. Don Quijote, que vio tan malparado a Sancho,
arremetió al que le había dado, con la lanza sobre mano, pero fueron tantos
los que se pusieron en medio, que no fue posible vengarle; antes, viendo
que llovía sobre él un nublado de piedras, y que le amenazaban mil
encaradas ballestas y no menos cantidad de arcabuces, volvió las riendas a
Rocinante, y a todo lo que su galope pudo, se salió de entre ellos,
encomendándose de todo corazón a Dios, que de aquel peligro le librase,
temiendo a cada paso no le entrase alguna bala por las espaldas y le
saliese al pecho; y a cada punto recogía el aliento, por ver si le faltaba.
Pero los del escuadrón se contentaron con verle huir, sin tirarle. A Sancho
le pusieron sobre su jumento, apenas vuelto en sí, y le dejaron ir tras su
amo, no porque él tuviese sentido para regirle; pero el rucio siguió las
huellas de Rocinante, sin el cual no se hallaba un punto. Alongado, pues,
don Quijote buen trecho, volvió la cabeza y vio que Sancho venía, y
atendióle, viendo que ninguno le seguía.
Los del escuadrón se estuvieron allí hasta la noche, y, por no haber salido
a la batalla sus contrarios, se volvieron a su pueblo, regocijados y
alegres; y si ellos supieran la costumbre antigua de los griegos,
levantaran en aquel lugar y sitio un trofeo.
Capítulo XXVIII. De cosas que dice Benengeli que las sabrá quien le leyere,
si las lee con atención
Cuando el valiente huye, la superchería está descubierta, y es de varones
prudentes guardarse para mejor ocasión. Esta verdad se verificó en don
Quijote, el cual, dando lugar a la furia del pueblo y a las malas
intenciones de aquel indignado escuadrón, puso pies en polvorosa, y, sin
acordarse de Sancho ni del peligro en que le dejaba, se apartó tanto cuanto
le pareció que bastaba para estar seguro. Seguíale Sancho, atravesado en su
jumento, como queda referido. Llegó, en fin, ya vuelto en su acuerdo, y al
llegar, se dejó caer del rucio a los pies de Rocinante, todo ansioso, todo
molido y todo apaleado. Apeóse don Quijote para catarle las feridas; pero,
como le hallase sano de los pies a la cabeza, con asaz cólera le dijo:
— ¡Tan en hora mala supistes vos rebuznar, Sancho! Y ¿dónde hallastes vos
ser bueno el nombrar la soga en casa del ahorcado? A música de rebuznos,
¿qué contrapunto se había de llevar sino de varapalos? Y dad gracias a
Dios, Sancho, que ya que os santiguaron con un palo, no os hicieron el per
signum crucis con un alfanje.
— No estoy para responder —respondió Sancho—, porque me parece que hablo por
las espaldas. Subamos y apartémonos de aquí, que yo pondré silencio en mis
rebuznos, pero no en dejar de decir que los caballeros andantes huyen, y
dejan a sus buenos escuderos molidos como alheña, o como cibera, en poder
de sus enemigos.
— No huye el que se retira —respondió don Quijote—, porque has de saber,
Sancho, que la valentía que no se funda sobre la basa de la prudencia se
llama temeridad, y las hazañas del temerario más se atribuyen a la buena
fortuna que a su ánimo. Y así, yo confieso que me he retirado, pero no
huido; y en esto he imitado a muchos valientes, que se han guardado para
tiempos mejores, y desto están las historias llenas, las cuales, por no
serte a ti de provecho ni a mí de gusto, no te las refiero ahora.
En esto, ya estaba a caballo Sancho, ayudado de don Quijote, el cual
asimismo subió en Rocinante, y poco a poco se fueron a emboscar en una
alameda que hasta un cuarto de legua de allí se parecía. De cuando en
cuando daba Sancho unos ayes profundísimos y unos gemidos dolorosos; y,
preguntándole don Quijote la causa de tan amargo sentimiento, respondió
que, desde la punta del espinazo hasta la nuca del celebro, le dolía de
manera que le sacaba de sentido.
— La causa dese dolor debe de ser, sin duda —dijo don Quijote—, que, como
era el palo con que te dieron largo y tendido, te cogió todas las espaldas,
donde entran todas esas partes que te duelen; y si más te cogiera, más te
doliera.
— ¡Por Dios —dijo Sancho—, que vuesa merced me ha sacado de una gran duda, y
que me la ha declarado por lindos términos! ¡Cuerpo de mí! ¿Tan encubierta
estaba la causa de mi dolor que ha sido menester decirme que me duele todo
todo aquello que alcanzó el palo? Si me dolieran los tobillos, aún pudiera
ser que se anduviera adivinando el porqué me dolían, pero dolerme lo que me
molieron no es mucho adivinar. A la fe, señor nuestro amo, el mal ajeno de
pelo cuelga, y cada día voy descubriendo tierra de lo poco que puedo
esperar de la compañía que con vuestra merced tengo; porque si esta vez me
ha dejado apalear, otra y otras ciento volveremos a los manteamientos de
marras y a otras muchacherías, que si ahora me han salido a las espaldas,
después me saldrán a los ojos. Harto mejor haría yo, sino que soy un
bárbaro, y no haré nada que bueno sea en toda mi vida; harto mejor haría
yo, vuelvo a decir, en volverme a mi casa, y a mi mujer, y a mis hijos, y
sustentarla y criarlos con lo que Dios fue servido de darme, y no andarme
tras vuesa merced por caminos sin camino y por sendas y carreras que no las
tienen, bebiendo mal y comiendo peor. Pues, ¡tomadme el dormir! Contad,
hermano escudero, siete pies de tierra, y si quisiéredes más, tomad otros
tantos, que en vuestra mano está escudillar, y tendeos a todo vuestro buen
talante; que quemado vea yo y hecho polvos al primero que dio puntada en la
andante caballería, o, a lo menos, al primero que quiso ser escudero de
tales tontos como debieron ser todos los caballeros andantes pasados. De
los presentes no digo nada, que, por ser vuestra merced uno dellos, los
tengo respeto, y porque sé que sabe vuesa merced un punto más que el diablo
en cuanto habla y en cuanto piensa.
— Haría yo una buena apuesta con vos, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—: que ahora
que vais hablando sin que nadie os vaya a la mano, que no os duele nada en
todo vuestro cuerpo. Hablad, hijo mío, todo aquello que os viniere al
pensamiento y a la boca; que, a trueco de que a vos no os duela nada,
tendré yo por gusto el enfado que me dan vuestras impertinencias. Y si
tanto deseáis volveros a vuestra casa con vuestra mujer y hijos, no permita
Dios que yo os lo impida; dineros tenéis míos: mirad cuánto ha que esta
tercera vez salimos de nuestro pueblo, y mirad lo que podéis y debéis ganar
cada mes, y pagaos de vuestra mano.
— Cuando yo servía —respondió Sancho— a Tomé Carrasco, el padre del
bachiller Sansón Carrasco, que vuestra merced bien conoce, dos ducados
ganaba cada mes, amén de la comida; con vuestra merced no sé lo que puedo
ganar, puesto que sé que tiene más trabajo el escudero del caballero
andante que el que sirve a un labrador; que, en resolución, los que
servimos a labradores, por mucho que trabajemos de día, por mal que suceda,
a la noche cenamos olla y dormimos en cama, en la cual no he dormido
después que ha que sirvo a vuestra merced. Si no ha sido el tiempo breve
que estuvimos en casa de don Diego de Miranda, y la jira que tuve con la
espuma que saqué de las ollas de Camacho, y lo que comí y bebí y dormí en
casa de Basilio, todo el otro tiempo he dormido en la dura tierra, al cielo
abierto, sujeto a lo que dicen inclemencias del cielo, sustentándome con
rajas de queso y mendrugos de pan, y bebiendo aguas, ya de arroyos, ya de
fuentes, de las que encontramos por esos andurriales donde andamos.
— Confieso —dijo don Quijote— que todo lo que dices, Sancho, sea verdad.
¿Cuánto parece que os debo dar más de lo que os daba Tomé Carrasco?
— A mi parecer —dijo Sancho—, con dos reales más que vuestra merced añadiese
cada mes me tendría por bien pagado. Esto es cuanto al salario de mi
trabajo; pero, en cuanto a satisfacerme a la palabra y promesa que vuestra
merced me tiene hecha de darme el gobierno de una ínsula, sería justo que
se me añadiesen otros seis reales, que por todos serían treinta.
— Está muy bien —replicó don Quijote—; y, conforme al salario que vos os
habéis señalado, 23 días ha que salimos de nuestro pueblo: contad, Sancho,
rata por cantidad, y mirad lo que os debo, y pagaos, como os tengo dicho,
de vuestra mano.
— ¡Oh, cuerpo de mí! —dijo Sancho—, que va vuestra merced muy errado en esta
cuenta, porque en lo de la promesa de la ínsula se ha de contar desde el
día que vuestra merced me la prometió hasta la presente hora en que
estamos.
— Pues, ¿qué tanto ha, Sancho, que os la prometí? —dijo don Quijote.
— Si yo mal no me acuerdo —respondió Sancho—, debe de haber más de veinte
años, tres días más a menos.
Diose don Quijote una gran palmada en la frente, y comenzó a reír muy de
gana, y dijo:
— Pues no anduve yo en Sierra Morena, ni en todo el discurso de nuestras
salidas, sino dos meses apenas, y ¿dices, Sancho, que ha veinte años que te
prometí la ínsula? Ahora digo que quieres que se consuman en tus salarios
el dinero que tienes mío; y si esto es así, y tú gustas dello, desde aquí
te lo doy, y buen provecho te haga; que, a trueco de verme sin tan mal
escudero, holgaréme de quedarme pobre y sin blanca. Pero dime, prevaricador
de las ordenanzas escuderiles de la andante caballería, ¿dónde has visto
tú, o leído, que ningún escudero de caballero andante se haya puesto con su
señor en tanto más cuánto me habéis de dar cada mes porque os sirva?
Éntrate, éntrate, malandrín, follón y vestiglo, que todo lo pareces;
éntrate, digo, por el mare magnum de sus historias, y si hallares que algún
escudero haya dicho, ni pensado, lo que aquí has dicho, quiero que me le
claves en la frente, y, por añadidura, me hagas cuatro mamonas selladas en
mi rostro. Vuelve las riendas, o el cabestro, al rucio, y vuélvete a tu
casa, porque un solo paso desde aquí no has de pasar más adelante conmigo.
¡Oh pan mal conocido! ¡Oh promesas mal colocadas! ¡Oh hombre que tiene más
de bestia que de persona! ¿Ahora, cuando yo pensaba ponerte en estado, y
tal, que a pesar de tu mujer te llamaran señoría, te despides? ¿Ahora te
vas, cuando yo venía con intención firme y valedera de hacerte señor de la
mejor ínsula del mundo? En fin, como tú has dicho otras veces, no es la
miel... etc. Asno eres, y asno has de ser, y en asno has de parar cuando se
te acabe el curso de la vida; que para mí tengo que antes llegará ella a su
último término que tú caigas y des en la cuenta de que eres bestia.
Miraba Sancho a don Quijote de en hito en hito, en tanto que los tales
vituperios le decía, y compungióse de manera que le vinieron las lágrimas a
los ojos, y con voz dolorida y enferma le dijo:
— Señor mío, yo confieso que para ser del todo asno no me falta más de la
cola; si vuestra merced quiere ponérmela, yo la daré por bien puesta, y le
serviré como jumento todos los días que me quedan de mi vida. Vuestra
merced me perdone y se duela de mi mocedad, y advierta que sé poco, y que
si hablo mucho, más procede de enfermedad que de malicia; mas, quien yerra
y se enmienda, a Dios se encomienda.
— Maravillárame yo, Sancho, si no mezclaras algún refrancico en tu coloquio.
Ahora bien, yo te perdono, con que te emiendes, y con que no te muestres de
aquí adelante tan amigo de tu interés, sino que procures ensanchar el
corazón, y te alientes y animes a esperar el cumplimiento de mis promesas,
que, aunque se tarda, no se imposibilita.
Sancho respondió que sí haría, aunque sacase fuerzas de flaqueza.
Con esto, se metieron en la alameda, y don Quijote se acomodó al pie de un
olmo, y Sancho al de una haya; que estos tales árboles y otros sus
semejantes siempre tienen pies, y no manos. Sancho pasó la noche
penosamente, porque el varapalo se hacía más sentir con el sereno. Don
Quijote la pasó en sus continuas memorias; pero, con todo eso, dieron los
ojos al sueño, y al salir del alba siguieron su camino buscando las riberas
del famoso Ebro, donde les sucedió lo que se contará en el capítulo
venidero.
Capítulo XXIX. De la famosa aventura del barco encantado
Por sus pasos contados y por contar, dos días después que salieron de la
alameda, llegaron don Quijote y Sancho al río Ebro, y el verle fue de gran
gusto a don Quijote, porque contempló y miró en él la amenidad de sus
riberas, la claridad de sus aguas, el sosiego de su curso y la abundancia
de sus líquidos cristales, cuya alegre vista renovó en su memoria mil
amorosos pensamientos. Especialmente fue y vino en lo que había visto en la
cueva de Montesinos; que, puesto que el mono de maese Pedro le había dicho
que parte de aquellas cosas eran verdad y parte mentira, él se atenía más a
las verdaderas que a las mentirosas, bien al revés de Sancho, que todas las
tenía por la mesma mentira.
Yendo, pues, desta manera, se le ofreció a la vista un pequeño barco sin
remos ni otras jarcias algunas, que estaba atado en la orilla a un tronco
de un árbol que en la ribera estaba. Miró don Quijote a todas partes, y no
vio persona alguna; y luego, sin más ni más, se apeó de Rocinante y mandó a
Sancho que lo mesmo hiciese del rucio, y que a entrambas bestias las atase
muy bien, juntas, al tronco de un álamo o sauce que allí estaba. Preguntóle
Sancho la causa de aquel súbito apeamiento y de aquel ligamiento. Respondió
don Quijote:
— Has de saber, Sancho, que este barco que aquí está, derechamente y sin
poder ser otra cosa en contrario, me está llamando y convidando a que entre
en él, y vaya en él a dar socorro a algún caballero, o a otra necesitada y
principal persona, que debe de estar puesta en alguna grande cuita, porque
éste es estilo de los libros de las historias caballerescas y de los
encantadores que en ellas se entremeten y platican: cuando algún caballero
está puesto en algún trabajo, que no puede ser librado dél sino por la mano
de otro caballero, puesto que estén distantes el uno del otro dos o tres
mil leguas, y aun más, o le arrebatan en una nube o le deparan un barco
donde se entre, y en menos de un abrir y cerrar de ojos le llevan, o por
los aires, o por la mar, donde quieren y adonde es menester su ayuda; así
que, ¡oh Sancho!, este barco está puesto aquí para el mesmo efecto; y esto
es tan verdad como es ahora de día; y antes que éste se pase, ata juntos al
rucio y a Rocinante, y a la mano de Dios, que nos guíe, que no dejaré de
embarcarme si me lo pidiesen frailes descalzos.
— Pues así es —respondió Sancho—, y vuestra merced quiere dar a cada paso en
estos que no sé si los llame disparates, no hay sino obedecer y bajar la
cabeza, atendiendo al refrán "haz lo que tu amo te manda, y siéntate con él
a la mesa"; pero, con todo esto, por lo que toca al descargo de mi
conciencia, quiero advertir a vuestra merced que a mí me parece que este
tal barco no es de los encantados, sino de algunos pescadores deste río,
porque en él se pescan las mejores sabogas del mundo.
Esto decía, mientras ataba las bestias, Sancho, dejándolas a la proteción y
amparo de los encantadores, con harto dolor de su ánima. Don Quijote le
dijo que no tuviese pena del desamparo de aquellos animales, que el que los
llevaría a ellos por tan longincuos caminos y regiones tendría cuenta de
sustentarlos.
— No entiendo eso de logicuos —dijo Sancho—, ni he oído tal vocablo en todos
los días de mi vida.
— Longincuos —respondió don Quijote— quiere decir apartados; y no es
maravilla que no lo entiendas, que no estás tú obligado a saber latín, como
algunos que presumen que lo saben, y lo ignoran.
— Ya están atados —replicó Sancho—. ¿Qué hemos de hacer ahora?
— ¿Qué? —respondió don Quijote—. Santiguarnos y levar ferro; quiero decir,
embarcarnos y cortar la amarra con que este barco está atado.
Y, dando un salto en él, siguiéndole Sancho, cortó el cordel, y el barco se
fue apartando poco a poco de la ribera; y cuando Sancho se vio obra de dos
varas dentro del río, comenzó a temblar, temiendo su perdición; pero
ninguna cosa le dio más pena que el oír roznar al rucio y el ver que
Rocinante pugnaba por desatarse, y díjole a su señor:
— El rucio rebuzna, condolido de nuestra ausencia, y Rocinante procura
ponerse en libertad para arrojarse tras nosotros. ¡Oh carísimos amigos,
quedaos en paz, y la locura que nos aparta de vosotros, convertida en
desengaño, nos vuelva a vuestra presencia!
Y, en esto, comenzó a llorar tan amargamente que don Quijote, mohíno y
colérico, le dijo:
— ¿De qué temes, cobarde criatura? ¿De qué lloras, corazón de mantequillas?
¿Quién te persigue, o quién te acosa, ánimo de ratón casero, o qué te
falta, menesteroso en la mitad de las entrañas de la abundancia? ¿Por dicha
vas caminando a pie y descalzo por las montañas rifeas, sino sentado en una
tabla, como un archiduque, por el sesgo curso deste agradable río, de donde
en breve espacio saldremos al mar dilatado? Pero ya habemos de haber
salido, y caminado, por lo menos, setecientas o ochocientas leguas; y si yo
tuviera aquí un astrolabio con que tomar la altura del polo, yo te dijera
las que hemos caminado; aunque, o yo sé poco, o ya hemos pasado, o
pasaremos presto, por la línea equinocial, que divide y corta los dos
contrapuestos polos en igual distancia.
— Y cuando lleguemos a esa leña que vuestra merced dice —preguntó Sancho—,
¿cuánto habremos caminado?
— Mucho —replicó don Quijote—, porque de trecientos y sesenta grados que
contiene el globo, del agua y de la tierra, según el cómputo de Ptolomeo,
que fue el mayor cosmógrafo que se sabe, la mitad habremos caminado,
llegando a la línea que he dicho.
— Por Dios —dijo Sancho—, que vuesa merced me trae por testigo de lo que
dice a una gentil persona, puto y gafo, con la añadidura de meón, o meo, o
no sé cómo.
Rióse don Quijote de la interpretación que Sancho había dado al nombre y al
cómputo y cuenta del cosmógrafo Ptolomeo, y díjole:
— Sabrás, Sancho, que los españoles y los que se embarcan en Cádiz para ir a
las Indias Orientales, una de las señales que tienen para entender que han
pasado la línea equinocial que te he dicho es que a todos los que van en el
navío se les mueren los piojos, sin que les quede ninguno, ni en todo el
bajel le hallarán, si le pesan a oro; y así, puedes, Sancho, pasear una
mano por un muslo, y si topares cosa viva, saldremos desta duda; y si no,
pasado habemos.
— Yo no creo nada deso —respondió Sancho—, pero, con todo, haré lo que vuesa
merced me manda, aunque no sé para qué hay necesidad de hacer esas
experiencias, pues yo veo con mis mismos ojos que no nos habemos apartado
de la ribera cinco varas, ni hemos decantado de donde están las alemañas
dos varas, porque allí están Rocinante y el rucio en el propio lugar do los
dejamos; y tomada la mira, como yo la tomo ahora, voto a tal que no nos
movemos ni andamos al paso de una hormiga.
— Haz, Sancho, la averiguación que te he dicho, y no te cures de otra, que
tú no sabes qué cosa sean coluros, líneas, paralelos, zodíacos, clíticas,
polos, solsticios, equinocios, planetas, signos, puntos, medidas, de que se
compone la esfera celeste y terrestre; que si todas estas cosas supieras, o
parte dellas, vieras claramente qué de paralelos hemos cortado, qué de
signos visto y qué de imágines hemos dejado atrás y vamos dejando ahora. Y
tórnote a decir que te tientes y pesques, que yo para mí tengo que estás
más limpio que un pliego de papel liso y blanco.
Tentóse Sancho, y, llegando con la mano bonitamente y con tiento hacia la
corva izquierda, alzó la cabeza y miró a su amo, y dijo:
— O la experiencia es falsa, o no hemos llegado adonde vuesa merced dice, ni
con muchas leguas.
— Pues ¿qué? —preguntó don Quijote—, ¿has topado algo?
— ¡Y aun algos! —respondió Sancho.
Y, sacudiéndose los dedos, se lavó toda la mano en el río, por el cual
sosegadamente se deslizaba el barco por mitad de la corriente, sin que le
moviese alguna inteligencia secreta, ni algún encantador escondido, sino el
mismo curso del agua, blando entonces y suave.
En esto, descubrieron unas grandes aceñas que en la mitad del río estaban;
y apenas las hubo visto don Quijote, cuando con voz alta dijo a Sancho:
— ¿Vees? Allí, ¡oh amigo!, se descubre la ciudad, castillo o fortaleza donde
debe de estar algún caballero oprimido, o alguna reina, infanta o princesa
malparada, para cuyo socorro soy aquí traído.
— ¿Qué diablos de ciudad, fortaleza o castillo dice vuesa merced, señor?
— dijo Sancho—. ¿No echa de ver que aquéllas son aceñas que están en el río,
donde se muele el trigo?
— Calla, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—; que, aunque parecen aceñas, no lo son; y
ya te he dicho que todas las cosas trastruecan y mudan de su ser natural
los encantos. No quiero decir que las mudan de en uno en otro ser
realmente, sino que lo parece, como lo mostró la experiencia en la
transformación de Dulcinea, único refugio de mis esperanzas.
En esto, el barco, entrado en la mitad de la corriente del río, comenzó a
caminar no tan lentamente como hasta allí. Los molineros de las aceñas, que
vieron venir aquel barco por el río, y que se iba a embocar por el raudal
de las ruedas, salieron con presteza muchos dellos con varas largas a
detenerle, y, como salían enharinados, y cubiertos los rostros y los
vestidos del polvo de la harina, representaban una mala vista. Daban voces
grandes, diciendo:
— ¡Demonios de hombres! ¿Dónde vais? ¿Venís desesperados? ¿Qué queréis,
ahogaros y haceros pedazos en estas ruedas?
— ¿No te dije yo, Sancho —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—, que habíamos
llegado donde he de mostrar a dó llega el valor de mi brazo? Mira qué de
malandrines y follones me salen al encuentro, mira cuántos vestiglos se me
oponen, mira cuántas feas cataduras nos hacen cocos... Pues ¡ahora lo
veréis, bellacos!
Y, puesto en pie en el barco, con grandes voces comenzó a amenazar a los
molineros, diciéndoles:
— Canalla malvada y peor aconsejada, dejad en su libertad y libre albedrío a
la persona que en esa vuestra fortaleza o prisión tenéis oprimida, alta o
baja, de cualquiera suerte o calidad que sea, que yo soy don Quijote de la
Mancha, llamado el Caballero de los Leones por otro nombre, a quien está
reservada por orden de los altos cielos el dar fin felice a esta aventura.
Y, diciendo esto, echó mano a su espada y comenzó a esgrimirla en el aire
contra los molineros; los cuales, oyendo y no entendiendo aquellas
sandeces, se pusieron con sus varas a detener el barco, que ya iba entrando
en el raudal y canal de las ruedas.
Púsose Sancho de rodillas, pidiendo devotamente al cielo le librase de tan
manifiesto peligro, como lo hizo, por la industria y presteza de los
molineros, que, oponiéndose con sus palos al barco, le detuvieron, pero no
de manera que dejasen de trastornar el barco y dar con don Quijote y con
Sancho al través en el agua; pero vínole bien a don Quijote, que sabía
nadar como un ganso, aunque el peso de las armas le llevó al fondo dos
veces; y si no fuera por los molineros, que se arrojaron al agua y los
sacaron como en peso a entrambos, allí había sido Troya para los dos.
Puestos, pues, en tierra, más mojados que muertos de sed, Sancho, puesto de
rodillas, las manos juntas y los ojos clavados al cielo, pidió a Dios con
una larga y devota plegaria le librase de allí adelante de los atrevidos
deseos y acometimientos de su señor.
Llegaron en esto los pescadores dueños del barco, a quien habían hecho
pedazos las ruedas de las aceñas; y, viéndole roto, acometieron a desnudar
a Sancho, y a pedir a don Quijote se lo pagase; el cual, con gran sosiego,
como si no hubiera pasado nada por él, dijo a los molineros y pescadores
que él pagaría el barco de bonísima gana, con condición que le diesen libre
y sin cautela a la persona o personas que en aquel su castillo estaban
oprimidas.
— ¿Qué personas o qué castillo dice —respondió uno de los molineros—, hombre
sin juicio? ¿Quiéreste llevar por ventura las que vienen a moler trigo a
estas aceñas?
— ¡Basta! —dijo entre sí don Quijote—. Aquí será predicar en desierto
querer reducir a esta canalla a que por ruegos haga virtud alguna. Y en
esta aventura se deben de haber encontrado dos valientes encantadores, y el
uno estorba lo que el otro intenta: el uno me deparó el barco, y el otro
dio conmigo al través. Dios lo remedie, que todo este mundo es máquinas y
trazas, contrarias unas de otras. Yo no puedo más.
Y, alzando la voz, prosiguió diciendo, y mirando a las aceñas:
— Amigos, cualesquiera que seáis, que en esa prisión quedáis encerrados,
perdonadme; que, por mi desgracia y por la vuestra, yo no os puedo sacar de
vuestra cuita. Para otro caballero debe de estar guardada y reservada esta
aventura.
En diciendo esto, se concertó con los pescadores, y pagó por el barco
cincuenta reales, que los dio Sancho de muy mala gana, diciendo:
— A dos barcadas como éstas, daremos con todo el caudal al fondo.
Los pescadores y molineros estaban admirados, mirando aquellas dos figuras
tan fuera del uso, al parecer, de los otros hombres, y no acababan de
entender a dó se encaminaban las razones y preguntas que don Quijote les
decía; y, teniéndolos por locos, les dejaron y se recogieron a sus aceñas,
y los pescadores a sus ranchos. Volvieron a sus bestias, y a ser bestias,
don Quijote y Sancho, y este fin tuvo la aventura del encantado barco.
Capítulo XXX. De lo que le avino a don Quijote con una bella cazadora
Asaz melancólicos y de mal talante llegaron a sus animales caballero y
escudero, especialmente Sancho, a quien llegaba al alma llegar al caudal
del dinero, pareciéndole que todo lo que dél se quitaba era quitárselo a
él de las niñas de sus ojos. Finalmente, sin hablarse palabra, se pusieron
a caballo y se apartaron del famoso río, don Quijote sepultado en los
pensamientos de sus amores, y Sancho en los de su acrecentamiento, que por
entonces le parecía que estaba bien lejos de tenerle; porque, maguer era
tonto, bien se le alcanzaba que las acciones de su amo, todas o las más,
eran disparates, y buscaba ocasión de que, sin entrar en cuentas ni en
despedimientos con su señor, un día se desgarrase y se fuese a su casa.
Pero la fortuna ordenó las cosas muy al revés de lo que él temía.
Sucedió, pues, que otro día, al poner del sol y al salir de una selva,
tendió don Quijote la vista por un verde prado, y en lo último dél vio
gente, y, llegándose cerca, conoció que eran cazadores de altanería.
Llegóse más, y entre ellos vio una gallarda señora sobre un palafrén o
hacanea blanquísima, adornada de guarniciones verdes y con un sillón de
plata. Venía la señora asimismo vestida de verde, tan bizarra y ricamente
que la misma bizarría venía transformada en ella. En la mano izquierda
traía un azor, señal que dio a entender a don Quijote ser aquélla alguna
gran señora, que debía serlo de todos aquellos cazadores, como era la
verdad; y así, dijo a Sancho:
— Corre, hijo Sancho, y di a aquella señora del palafrén y del azor que yo,
el Caballero de los Leones, besa las manos a su gran fermosura, y que si su
grandeza me da licencia, se las iré a besar, y a servirla en cuanto mis
fuerzas pudieren y su alteza me mandare. Y mira, Sancho, cómo hablas, y ten
cuenta de no encajar algún refrán de los tuyos en tu embajada.
— ¡Hallado os le habéis el encajador! —respondió Sancho—. ¡A mí con eso!
¡Sí, que no es ésta la vez primera que he llevado embajadas a altas y
crecidas señoras en esta vida!
— Si no fue la que llevaste a la señora Dulcinea —replicó don Quijote—, yo
no sé que hayas llevado otra, a lo menos en mi poder.
— Así es verdad —respondió Sancho—, pero al buen pagador no le duelen
prendas, y en casa llena presto se guisa la cena; quiero decir que a mí no
hay que decirme ni advertirme de nada, que para todo tengo y de todo se me
alcanza un poco.
— Yo lo creo, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—; ve en buena hora, y Dios te guíe.
Partió Sancho de carrera, sacando de su paso al rucio, y llegó donde la
bella cazadora estaba, y, apeándose, puesto ante ella de hinojos, le dijo:
— Hermosa señora, aquel caballero que allí se parece, llamado el Caballero
de los Leones, es mi amo, y yo soy un escudero suyo, a quien llaman en su
casa Sancho Panza. Este tal Caballero de los Leones, que no ha mucho que se
llamaba el de la Triste Figura, envía por mí a decir a vuestra grandeza sea
servida de darle licencia para que, con su propósito y beneplácito y
consentimiento, él venga a poner en obra su deseo, que no es otro, según él
dice y yo pienso, que de servir a vuestra encumbrada altanería y fermosura;
que en dársela vuestra señoría hará cosa que redunde en su pro, y él
recibirá señaladísima merced y contento.
— Por cierto, buen escudero —respondió la señora—, vos habéis dado la
embajada vuestra con todas aquellas circunstancias que las tales embajadas
piden. Levantaos del suelo, que escudero de tan gran caballero como es el
de la Triste Figura, de quien ya tenemos acá mucha noticia, no es justo que
esté de hinojos; levantaos, amigo, y decid a vuestro señor que venga mucho
en hora buena a servirse de mí y del duque mi marido, en una casa de placer
que aquí tenemos.
Levantóse Sancho admirado, así de la hermosura de la buena señora como de
su mucha crianza y cortesía, y más de lo que le había dicho que tenía
noticia de su señor el Caballero de la Triste Figura, y que si no le
había llamado el de los Leones, debía de ser por habérsele puesto tan
nuevamente. Preguntóle la duquesa, cuyo título aún no se sabe:
— Decidme, hermano escudero: este vuestro señor, ¿no es uno de quien anda
impresa una historia que se llama del ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la
Mancha, que tiene por señora de su alma a una tal Dulcinea del Toboso?
— El mesmo es, señora —respondió Sancho—; y aquel escudero suyo que anda, o
debe de andar, en la tal historia, a quien llaman Sancho Panza, soy yo, si
no es que me trocaron en la cuna; quiero decir, que me trocaron en la
estampa.
— De todo eso me huelgo yo mucho —dijo la duquesa—. Id, hermano Panza, y
decid a vuestro señor que él sea el bien llegado y el bien venido a mis
estados, y que ninguna cosa me pudiera venir que más contento me diera.
Sancho, con esta tan agradable respuesta, con grandísimo gusto volvió a su
amo, a quien contó todo lo que la gran señora le había dicho, levantando
con sus rústicos términos a los cielos su mucha fermosura, su gran donaire
y cortesía. Don Quijote se gallardeó en la silla, púsose bien en los
estribos, acomodóse la visera, arremetió a Rocinante, y con gentil denuedo
fue a besar las manos a la duquesa; la cual, haciendo llamar al duque, su
marido, le contó, en tanto que don Quijote llegaba, toda la embajada suya;
y los dos, por haber leído la primera parte desta historia y haber
entendido por ella el disparatado humor de don Quijote, con grandísimo
gusto y con deseo de conocerle le atendían, con prosupuesto de seguirle el
humor y conceder con él en cuanto les dijese, tratándole como a caballero
andante los días que con ellos se detuviese, con todas las ceremonias
acostumbradas en los libros de caballerías, que ellos habían leído, y aun
les eran muy aficionados.
En esto, llegó don Quijote, alzada la visera; y, dando muestras de apearse,
acudió Sancho a tenerle el estribo; pero fue tan desgraciado que, al
apearse del rucio, se le asió un pie en una soga del albarda, de tal modo
que no fue posible desenredarle, antes quedó colgado dél, con la boca y los
pechos en el suelo. Don Quijote, que no tenía en costumbre apearse sin que
le tuviesen el estribo, pensando que ya Sancho había llegado a tenérsele,
descargó de golpe el cuerpo, y llevóse tras sí la silla de Rocinante, que
debía de estar mal cinchado, y la silla y él vinieron al suelo, no sin
vergüenza suya y de muchas maldiciones que entre dientes echó al desdichado
de Sancho, que aún todavía tenía el pie en la corma.
El duque mandó a sus cazadores que acudiesen al caballero y al escudero,
los cuales levantaron a don Quijote maltrecho de la caída, y, renqueando y
como pudo, fue a hincar las rodillas ante los dos señores; pero el duque no
lo consintió en ninguna manera, antes, apeándose de su caballo, fue a
abrazar a don Quijote, diciéndole:
— A mí me pesa, señor Caballero de la Triste Figura, que la primera que
vuesa merced ha hecho en mi tierra haya sido tan mala como se ha visto;
pero descuidos de escuderos suelen ser causa de otros peores sucesos.
— El que yo he tenido en veros, valeroso príncipe —respondió don Quijote—,
es imposible ser malo, aunque mi caída no parara hasta el profundo de los
abismos, pues de allí me levantara y me sacara la gloria de haberos visto.
Mi escudero, que Dios maldiga, mejor desata la lengua para decir malicias
que ata y cincha una silla para que esté firme; pero, comoquiera que yo me
halle, caído o levantado, a pie o a caballo, siempre estaré al servicio
vuestro y al de mi señora la duquesa, digna consorte vuestra, y digna
señora de la hermosura y universal princesa de la cortesía.
— ¡Pasito, mi señor don Quijote de la Mancha! —dijo el duque—, que adonde
está mi señora doña Dulcinea del Toboso no es razón que se alaben otras
fermosuras.
Ya estaba a esta sazón libre Sancho Panza del lazo, y, hallándose allí
cerca, antes que su amo respondiese, dijo:
— No se puede negar, sino afirmar, que es muy hermosa mi señora Dulcinea del
Toboso, pero donde menos se piensa se levanta la liebre; que yo he oído
decir que esto que llaman naturaleza es como un alcaller que hace vasos de
barro, y el que hace un vaso hermoso también puede hacer dos, y tres y
ciento; dígolo porque mi señora la duquesa a fee que no va en zaga a mi ama
la señora Dulcinea del Toboso.
Volvióse don Quijote a la duquesa y dijo:
— Vuestra grandeza imagine que no tuvo caballero andante en el mundo
escudero más hablador ni más gracioso del que yo tengo, y él me sacará
verdadero si algunos días quisiere vuestra gran celsitud servirse de mí.
A lo que respondió la duquesa:
— De que Sancho el bueno sea gracioso lo estimo yo en mucho, porque es señal
que es discreto; que las gracias y los donaires, señor don Quijote, como
vuesa merced bien sabe, no asientan sobre ingenios torpes; y, pues el buen
Sancho es gracioso y donairoso, desde aquí le confirmo por discreto.
— Y hablador —añadió don Quijote.
— Tanto que mejor —dijo el duque—, porque muchas gracias no se pueden decir
con pocas palabras. Y, porque no se nos vaya el tiempo en ellas, venga el
gran Caballero de la Triste Figura...
— De los Leones ha de decir vuestra alteza —dijo Sancho—, que ya no hay
Triste Figura, ni figuro.
— Sea el de los Leones —prosiguió el duque—. Digo que venga el señor
Caballero de los Leones a un castillo mío que está aquí cerca, donde se le
hará el acogimiento que a tan alta persona se debe justamente, y el que yo
y la duquesa solemos hacer a todos los caballeros andantes que a él llegan.
Ya en esto, Sancho había aderezado y cinchado bien la silla a Rocinante; y,
subiendo en él don Quijote, y el duque en un hermoso caballo, pusieron a la
duquesa en medio y encaminaron al castillo. Mandó la duquesa a Sancho que
fuese junto a ella, porque gustaba infinito de oír sus discreciones. No se
hizo de rogar Sancho, y entretejióse entre los tres, y hizo cuarto en la
conversación, con gran gusto de la duquesa y del duque, que tuvieron a gran
ventura acoger en su castillo tal caballero andante y tal escudero andado.
Capítulo XXXI. Que trata de muchas y grandes cosas
Suma era la alegría que llevaba consigo Sancho, viéndose, a su parecer, en
privanza con la duquesa, porque se le figuraba que había de hallar en su
castillo lo que en la casa de don Diego y en la de Basilio, siempre
aficionado a la buena vida; y así, tomaba la ocasión por la melena en esto
del regalarse cada y cuando que se le ofrecía.
Cuenta, pues, la historia, que antes que a la casa de placer o castillo
llegasen, se adelantó el duque y dio orden a todos sus criados del modo que
habían de tratar a don Quijote; el cual, como llegó con la duquesa a las
puertas del castillo, al instante salieron dél dos lacayos o palafreneros,
vestidos hasta en pies de unas ropas que llaman de levantar, de finísimo
raso carmesí, y, cogiendo a don Quijote en brazos, sin ser oído ni visto,
le dijeron:
— Vaya la vuestra grandeza a apear a mi señora la duquesa.
Don Quijote lo hizo, y hubo grandes comedimientos entre los dos sobre el
caso; pero, en efecto, venció la porfía de la duquesa, y no quiso decender
o bajar del palafrén sino en los brazos del duque, diciendo que no se
hallaba digna de dar a tan gran caballero tan inútil carga. En fin, salió
el duque a apearla; y al entrar en un gran patio, llegaron dos hermosas
doncellas y echaron sobre los hombros a don Quijote un gran manto de
finísima escarlata, y en un instante se coronaron todos los corredores del
patio de criados y criadas de aquellos señores, diciendo a grandes voces:
— ¡Bien sea venido la flor y la nata de los caballeros andantes!
Y todos, o los más, derramaban pomos de aguas olorosas sobre don Quijote y
sobre los duques, de todo lo cual se admiraba don Quijote; y aquél fue el
primer día que de todo en todo conoció y creyó ser caballero andante
verdadero, y no fantástico, viéndose tratar del mesmo modo que él había
leído se trataban los tales caballeros en los pasados siglos.
Sancho, desamparando al rucio, se cosió con la duquesa y se entró en el
castillo; y, remordiéndole la conciencia de que dejaba al jumento solo, se
llegó a una reverenda dueña, que con otras a recebir a la duquesa había
salido, y con voz baja le dijo:
— Señora González, o como es su gracia de vuesa merced...
— Doña Rodríguez de Grijalba me llamo —respondió la dueña—. ¿Qué es lo que
mandáis, hermano?
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— Querría que vuesa merced me la hiciese de salir a la puerta del castillo,
donde hallará un asno rucio mío; vuesa merced sea servida de mandarle
poner, o ponerle, en la caballeriza, porque el pobrecito es un poco
medroso, y no se hallará a estar solo en ninguna de las maneras.
— Si tan discreto es el amo como el mozo —respondió la dueña—, ¡medradas
estamos! Andad, hermano, mucho de enhoramala para vos y para quien acá os
trujo, y tened cuenta con vuestro jumento, que las dueñas desta casa no
estamos acostumbradas a semejantes haciendas.
— Pues en verdad —respondió Sancho— que he oído yo decir a mi señor, que es
zahorí de las historias, contando aquella de Lanzarote,
cuando de Bretaña vino,
que damas curaban dél,
y dueñas del su rocino;
y que en el particular de mi asno, que no le trocara yo con el rocín del
señor Lanzarote.
— Hermano, si sois juglar —replicó la dueña—, guardad vuestras gracias para
donde lo parezcan y se os paguen, que de mi no podréis llevar sino una
higa.
— ¡Aun bien —respondió Sancho— que será bien madura, pues no perderá vuesa
merced la quínola de sus años por punto menos!
— Hijo de puta —dijo la dueña, toda ya encendida en cólera—, si soy vieja o
no, a Dios daré la cuenta, que no a vos, bellaco, harto de ajos.
Y esto dijo en voz tan alta, que lo oyó la duquesa; y, volviendo y viendo a
la dueña tan alborotada y tan encarnizados los ojos, le preguntó con quién
las había.
— Aquí las he —respondió la dueña— con este buen hombre, que me ha pedido
encarecidamente que vaya a poner en la caballeriza a un asno suyo que está
a la puerta del castillo, trayéndome por ejemplo que así lo hicieron no sé
dónde, que unas damas curaron a un tal Lanzarote, y unas dueñas a su
rocino, y, sobre todo, por buen término me ha llamado vieja.
— Eso tuviera yo por afrenta —respondió la duquesa—, más que cuantas
pudieran decirme.
Y, hablando con Sancho, le dijo:
— Advertid, Sancho amigo, que doña Rodríguez es muy moza, y que aquellas
tocas más las trae por autoridad y por la usanza que por los años.
— Malos sean los que me quedan por vivir —respondió Sancho—, si lo dije por
tanto; sólo lo dije porque es tan grande el cariño que tengo a mi jumento,
que me pareció que no podía encomendarle a persona más caritativa que a la
señora doña Rodríguez.
Don Quijote, que todo lo oía, le dijo:
— ¿Pláticas son éstas, Sancho, para este lugar?
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, cada uno ha de hablar de su menester dondequiera
que estuviere; aquí se me acordó del rucio, y aquí hablé dél; y si en la
caballeriza se me acordara, allí hablara.
A lo que dijo el duque:
— Sancho está muy en lo cierto, y no hay que culparle en nada; al rucio se
le dará recado a pedir de boca, y descuide Sancho, que se le tratará como a
su mesma persona.
Con estos razonamientos, gustosos a todos sino a don Quijote, llegaron a lo
alto y entraron a don Quijote en una sala adornada de telas riquísimas de
oro y de brocado; seis doncellas le desarmaron y sirvieron de pajes, todas
industriadas y advertidas del duque y de la duquesa de lo que habían de
hacer, y de cómo habían de tratar a don Quijote, para que imaginase y viese
que le trataban como caballero andante. Quedó don Quijote, después de
desarmado, en sus estrechos greguescos y en su jubón de camuza, seco, alto,
tendido, con las quijadas, que por de dentro se besaba la una con la otra;
figura que, a no tener cuenta las doncellas que le servían con disimular la
risa —que fue una de las precisas órdenes que sus señores les habían dado—,
reventaran riendo.
Pidiéronle que se dejase desnudar para una camisa, pero nunca lo consintió,
diciendo que la honestidad parecía tan bien en los caballeros andantes como
la valentía. Con todo, dijo que diesen la camisa a Sancho, y, encerrándose
con él en una cuadra donde estaba un rico lecho, se desnudó y vistió la
camisa; y, viéndose solo con Sancho, le dijo:
— Dime, truhán moderno y majadero antiguo: ¿parécete bien deshonrar y
afrentar a una dueña tan veneranda y tan digna de respeto como aquélla?
¿Tiempos eran aquéllos para acordarte del rucio, o señores son éstos para
dejar mal pasar a las bestias, tratando tan elegantemente a sus dueños? Por
quien Dios es, Sancho, que te reportes, y que no descubras la hilaza de
manera que caigan en la cuenta de que eres de villana y grosera tela
tejido. Mira, pecador de ti, que en tanto más es tenido el señor cuanto
tiene más honrados y bien nacidos criados, y que una de las ventajas
mayores que llevan los príncipes a los demás hombres es que se sirven de
criados tan buenos como ellos. ¿No adviertes, angustiado de ti, y
malaventurado de mí, que si veen que tú eres un grosero villano, o un
mentecato gracioso, pensarán que yo soy algún echacuervos, o algún
caballero de mohatra? No, no, Sancho amigo, huye, huye destos
inconvinientes, que quien tropieza en hablador y en gracioso, al primer
puntapié cae y da en truhán desgraciado. Enfrena la lengua, considera y
rumia las palabras antes que te salgan de la boca, y advierte que hemos
llegado a parte donde, con el favor de Dios y valor de mi brazo, hemos de
salir mejorados en tercio y quinto en fama y en hacienda.
Sancho le prometió con muchas veras de coserse la boca, o morderse la
lengua, antes de hablar palabra que no fuese muy a propósito y bien
considerada, como él se lo mandaba, y que descuidase acerca de lo tal, que
nunca por él se descubriría quién ellos eran.
Vistióse don Quijote, púsose su tahalí con su espada, echóse el mantón de
escarlata a cuestas, púsose una montera de raso verde que las doncellas le
dieron, y con este adorno salió a la gran sala, adonde halló a las
doncellas puestas en ala, tantas a una parte como a otra, y todas con
aderezo de darle aguamanos, la cual le dieron con muchas reverencias y
ceremonias.
Luego llegaron doce pajes con el maestresala, para llevarle a comer, que ya
los señores le aguardaban. Cogiéronle en medio, y, lleno de pompa y
majestad, le llevaron a otra sala, donde estaba puesta una rica mesa con
solos cuatro servicios. La duquesa y el duque salieron a la puerta de la
sala a recebirle, y con ellos un grave eclesiástico, destos que gobiernan
las casas de los príncipes; destos que, como no nacen príncipes, no
aciertan a enseñar cómo lo han de ser los que lo son; destos que quieren
que la grandeza de los grandes se mida con la estrecheza de sus ánimos;
destos que, queriendo mostrar a los que ellos gobiernan a ser limitados,
les hacen ser miserables; destos tales, digo que debía de ser el grave
religioso que con los duques salió a recebir a don Quijote. Hiciéronse mil
corteses comedimientos, y, finalmente, cogiendo a don Quijote en medio, se
fueron a sentar a la mesa.
Convidó el duque a don Quijote con la cabecera de la mesa, y aunque él lo
rehusó, las importunaciones del duque fueron tantas que la hubo de tomar.
El eclesiástico se sentó frontero, y el duque y la duquesa a los dos lados.
A todo estaba presente Sancho, embobado y atónito de ver la honra que a su
señor aquellos príncipes le hacían; y, viendo las muchas ceremonias y
ruegos que pasaron entre el duque y don Quijote para hacerle sentar a la
cabecera de la mesa, dijo:
— Si sus mercedes me dan licencia, les contaré un cuento que pasó en mi
pueblo acerca desto de los asientos.
Apenas hubo dicho esto Sancho, cuando don Quijote tembló, creyendo sin duda
alguna que había de decir alguna necedad. Miróle Sancho y entendióle, y
dijo:
— No tema vuesa merced, señor mío, que yo me desmande, ni que diga cosa que
no venga muy a pelo, que no se me han olvidado los consejos que poco ha
vuesa merced me dio sobre el hablar mucho o poco, o bien o mal.
— Yo no me acuerdo de nada, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—; di lo que
quisieres, como lo digas presto.
— Pues lo que quiero decir —dijo Sancho— es tan verdad, que mi señor don
Quijote, que está presente, no me dejará mentir.
— Por mí —replicó don Quijote—, miente tú, Sancho, cuanto quisieres, que yo
no te iré a la mano, pero mira lo que vas a decir.
— Tan mirado y remirado lo tengo, que a buen salvo está el que repica, como
se verá por la obra.
— Bien será —dijo don Quijote— que vuestras grandezas manden echar de aquí a
este tonto, que dirá mil patochadas.
— Por vida del duque —dijo la duquesa—, que no se ha de apartar de mí Sancho
un punto: quiérole yo mucho, porque sé que es muy discreto.
— Discretos días —dijo Sancho— viva vuestra santidad por el buen crédito que
de mí tiene, aunque en mí no lo haya. Y el cuento que quiero decir es éste:
«Convidó un hidalgo de mi pueblo, muy rico y principal, porque venía de los
Álamos de Medina del Campo, que casó con doña Mencía de Quiñones, que fue
hija de don Alonso de Marañón, caballero del hábito de Santiago, que se
ahogó en la Herradura, por quien hubo aquella pendencia años ha en nuestro
lugar, que, a lo que entiendo, mi señor don Quijote se halló en ella, de
donde salió herido Tomasillo el Travieso, el hijo de Balbastro el
herrero...» ¿No es verdad todo esto, señor nuestro amo? Dígalo, por su
vida, porque estos señores no me tengan por algún hablador mentiroso.
— Hasta ahora —dijo el eclesiástico—, más os tengo por hablador que por
mentiroso, pero de aquí adelante no sé por lo que os tendré.
— Tú das tantos testigos, Sancho, y tantas señas, que no puedo dejar de
decir que debes de decir verdad. Pasa adelante y acorta el cuento, porque
llevas camino de no acabar en dos días.
— No ha de acortar tal —dijo la duquesa—, por hacerme a mí placer; antes, le
ha de contar de la manera que le sabe, aunque no le acabe en seis días; que
si tantos fuesen, serían para mí los mejores que hubiese llevado en mi
vida.
— «Digo, pues, señores míos —prosiguió Sancho—, que este tal hidalgo, que yo
conozco como a mis manos, porque no hay de mi casa a la suya un tiro de
ballesta, convidó un labrador pobre, pero honrado.»
— Adelante, hermano —dijo a esta sazón el religioso—, que camino lleváis de
no parar con vuestro cuento hasta el otro mundo.
— A menos de la mitad pararé, si Dios fuere servido —respondió Sancho—. «Y
así, digo que, llegando el tal labrador a casa del dicho hidalgo
convidador, que buen poso haya su ánima, que ya es muerto, y por más señas
dicen que hizo una muerte de un ángel, que yo no me hallé presente, que
había ido por aquel tiempo a segar a Tembleque...»
— Por vida vuestra, hijo, que volváis presto de Tembleque, y que, sin
enterrar al hidalgo, si no queréis hacer más exequias, acabéis vuestro
cuento.
— «Es, pues, el caso —replicó Sancho— que, estando los dos para asentarse a
la mesa, que parece que ahora los veo más que nunca...»
Gran gusto recebían los duques del disgusto que mostraba tomar el buen
religioso de la dilación y pausas con que Sancho contaba su cuento, y don
Quijote se estaba consumiendo en cólera y en rabia.
— «Digo, así —dijo Sancho—, que, estando, como he dicho, los dos para
sentarse a la mesa, el labrador porfiaba con el hidalgo que tomase la
cabecera de la mesa, y el hidalgo porfiaba también que el labrador la
tomase, porque en su casa se había de hacer lo que él mandase; pero el
labrador, que presumía de cortés y bien criado, jamás quiso, hasta que el
hidalgo, mohíno, poniéndole ambas manos sobre los hombros, le hizo sentar
por fuerza, diciéndole: ''Sentaos, majagranzas, que adondequiera que yo me
siente será vuestra cabecera''.» Y éste es el cuento, y en verdad que creo
que no ha sido aquí traído fuera de propósito.
Púsose don Quijote de mil colores, que sobre lo moreno le jaspeaban y se le
parecían; los señores disimularon la risa, porque don Quijote no acabase de
correrse, habiendo entendido la malicia de Sancho; y, por mudar de plática
y hacer que Sancho no prosiguiese con otros disparates, preguntó la duquesa
a don Quijote que qué nuevas tenía de la señora Dulcinea, y que si le había
enviado aquellos días algunos presentes de gigantes o malandrines, pues no
podía dejar de haber vencido muchos. A lo que don Quijote respondió:
— Señora mía, mis desgracias, aunque tuvieron principio, nunca tendrán fin.
Gigantes he vencido, y follones y malandrines le he enviado, pero ¿adónde
la habían de hallar, si está encantada y vuelta en la más fea labradora que
imaginar se puede?
— No sé —dijo Sancho Panza—, a mí me parece la más hermosa criatura del
mundo; a lo menos, en la ligereza y en el brincar bien sé yo que no dará
ella la ventaja a un volteador; a buena fe, señora duquesa, así salta desde
el suelo sobre una borrica como si fuera un gato.
— ¿Habéisla visto vos encantada, Sancho? —preguntó el duque.
— Y ¡cómo si la he visto! —respondió Sancho—. Pues, ¿quién diablos sino yo
fue el primero que cayó en el achaque del encantorio? ¡Tan encantada está
como mi padre!
El eclesiástico, que oyó decir de gigantes, de follones y de encantos, cayó
en la cuenta de que aquél debía de ser don Quijote de la Mancha, cuya
historia leía el duque de ordinario, y él se lo había reprehendido muchas
veces, diciéndole que era disparate leer tales disparates; y, enterándose
ser verdad lo que sospechaba, con mucha cólera, hablando con el duque, le
dijo:
— Vuestra Excelencia, señor mío, tiene que dar cuenta a Nuestro Señor de lo
que hace este buen hombre. Este don Quijote, o don Tonto, o como se llama,
imagino yo que no debe de ser tan mentecato como Vuestra Excelencia quiere
que sea, dándole ocasiones a la mano para que lleve adelante sus sandeces y
vaciedades.
Y, volviendo la plática a don Quijote, le dijo:
— Y a vos, alma de cántaro, ¿quién os ha encajado en el celebro que sois
caballero andante y que vencéis gigantes y prendéis malandrines? Andad en
hora buena, y en tal se os diga: volveos a vuestra casa, y criad vuestros
hijos, si los tenéis, y curad de vuestra hacienda, y dejad de andar vagando
por el mundo, papando viento y dando que reír a cuantos os conocen y no
conocen. ¿En dónde, nora tal, habéis vos hallado que hubo ni hay ahora
caballeros andantes? ¿Dónde hay gigantes en España, o malandrines en la
Mancha, ni Dulcineas encantadas, ni toda la caterva de las simplicidades
que de vos se cuentan?
Atento estuvo don Quijote a las razones de aquel venerable varón, y, viendo
que ya callaba, sin guardar respeto a los duques, con semblante airado y
alborotado rostro, se puso en pie y dijo...
Pero esta respuesta capítulo por sí merece.
Capítulo XXXII. De la respuesta que dio don Quijote a su reprehensor, con
otros graves y graciosos sucesos
Levantado, pues, en pie don Quijote, temblando de los pies a la cabeza como
azogado, con presurosa y turbada lengua, dijo:
— El lugar donde estoy, y la presencia ante quien me hallo y el respeto que
siempre tuve y tengo al estado que vuesa merced profesa tienen y atan las
manos de mi justo enojo; y, así por lo que he dicho como por saber que
saben todos que las armas de los togados son las mesmas que las de la
mujer, que son la lengua, entraré con la mía en igual batalla con vuesa
merced, de quien se debía esperar antes buenos consejos que infames
vituperios. Las reprehensiones santas y bien intencionadas otras
circunstancias requieren y otros puntos piden: a lo menos, el haberme
reprehendido en público y tan ásperamente ha pasado todos los límites de la
buena reprehensión, pues las primeras mejor asientan sobre la blandura que
sobre la aspereza, y no es bien que, sin tener conocimiento del pecado que
se reprehende, llamar al pecador, sin más ni más, mentecato y tonto. Si no,
dígame vuesa merced: ¿por cuál de las mentecaterías que en mí ha visto me
condena y vitupera, y me manda que me vaya a mi casa a tener cuenta en el
gobierno della y de mi mujer y de mis hijos, sin saber si la tengo o los
tengo? ¿No hay más sino a troche moche entrarse por las casas ajenas a
gobernar sus dueños, y, habiéndose criado algunos en la estrecheza de algún
pupilaje, sin haber visto más mundo que el que puede contenerse en veinte o
treinta leguas de distrito, meterse de rondón a dar leyes a la caballería y
a juzgar de los caballeros andantes? ¿Por ventura es asumpto vano o es
tiempo mal gastado el que se gasta en vagar por el mundo, no buscando los
regalos dél, sino las asperezas por donde los buenos suben al asiento de la
inmortalidad? Si me tuvieran por tonto los caballeros, los magníficos, los
generosos, los altamente nacidos, tuviéralo por afrenta inreparable; pero
de que me tengan por sandio los estudiantes, que nunca entraron ni pisaron
las sendas de la caballería, no se me da un ardite: caballero soy y
caballero he de morir si place al Altísimo. Unos van por el ancho campo de
la ambición soberbia; otros, por el de la adulación servil y baja; otros,
por el de la hipocresía engañosa, y algunos, por el de la verdadera
religión; pero yo, inclinado de mi estrella, voy por la angosta senda de la
caballería andante, por cuyo ejercicio desprecio la hacienda, pero no la
honra. Yo he satisfecho agravios, enderezado tuertos, castigado
insolencias, vencido gigantes y atropellado vestiglos; yo soy enamorado, no
más de porque es forzoso que los caballeros andantes lo sean; y, siéndolo,
no soy de los enamorados viciosos, sino de los platónicos continentes. Mis
intenciones siempre las enderezo a buenos fines, que son de hacer bien a
todos y mal a ninguno; si el que esto entiende, si el que esto obra, si el
que desto trata merece ser llamado bobo, díganlo vuestras grandezas, duque
y duquesa excelentes.
— ¡Bien, por Dios! —dijo Sancho—. No diga más vuestra merced, señor y amo
mío, en su abono, porque no hay más que decir, ni más que pensar, ni más
que perseverar en el mundo. Y más, que, negando este señor, como ha negado,
que no ha habido en el mundo, ni los hay, caballeros andantes, ¿qué mucho
que no sepa ninguna de las cosas que ha dicho?
— ¿Por ventura —dijo el eclesiástico— sois vos, hermano, aquel Sancho Panza
que dicen, a quien vuestro amo tiene prometida una ínsula?
— Sí soy —respondió Sancho—; y soy quien la merece tan bien como otro
cualquiera; soy quien "júntate a los buenos y serás uno dellos", y soy yo
de aquellos "no con quien naces, sino con quien paces", y de los "quien a
buen árbol se arrima, buena sombra le cobija". Yo me he arrimado a buen
señor, y ha muchos meses que ando en su compañía, y he de ser otro como él,
Dios queriendo; y viva él y viva yo: que ni a él le faltarán imperios que
mandar ni a mí ínsulas que gobernar.
— No, por cierto, Sancho amigo —dijo a esta sazón el duque—, que yo, en
nombre del señor don Quijote, os mando el gobierno de una que tengo de
nones, de no pequeña calidad.
— Híncate de rodillas, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, y besa los pies a Su
Excelencia por la merced que te ha hecho.
Hízolo así Sancho; lo cual visto por el eclesiástico, se levantó de la
mesa, mohíno además, diciendo:
— Por el hábito que tengo, que estoy por decir que es tan sandio Vuestra
Excelencia como estos pecadores. ¡Mirad si no han de ser ellos locos, pues
los cuerdos canonizan sus locuras! Quédese Vuestra Excelencia con ellos;
que, en tanto que estuvieren en casa, me estaré yo en la mía, y me escusaré
de reprehender lo que no puedo remediar.
Y, sin decir más ni comer más, se fue, sin que fuesen parte a detenerle los
ruegos de los duques; aunque el duque no le dijo mucho, impedido de la risa
que su impertinente cólera le había causado. Acabó de reír y dijo a don
Quijote:
— Vuesa merced, señor Caballero de los Leones, ha respondido por sí tan
altamente que no le queda cosa por satisfacer deste que, aunque parece
agravio, no lo es en ninguna manera; porque, así como no agravian las
mujeres, no agravian los eclesiásticos, como vuesa merced mejor sabe.
— Así es —respondió don Quijote—, y la causa es que el que no puede ser
agraviado no puede agraviar a nadie. Las mujeres, los niños y los
eclesiásticos, como no pueden defenderse, aunque sean ofendidos, no pueden
ser afrentados; porque entre el agravio y la afrenta hay esta diferencia,
como mejor Vuestra Excelencia sabe: la afrenta viene de parte de quien la
puede hacer, y la hace y la sustenta; el agravio puede venir de cualquier
parte, sin que afrente. Sea ejemplo: está uno en la calle descuidado,
llegan diez con mano armada, y, dándole de palos, pone mano a la espada y
hace su deber, pero la muchedumbre de los contrarios se le opone, y no le
deja salir con su intención, que es de vengarse; este tal queda agraviado,
pero no afrentado. Y lo mesmo confirmará otro ejemplo: está uno vuelto de
espaldas, llega otro y dale de palos, y en dándoselos huye y no espera, y
el otro le sigue y no alcanza; este que recibió los palos, recibió agravio,
mas no afrenta, porque la afrenta ha de ser sustentada. Si el que le dio
los palos, aunque se los dio a hurtacordel, pusiera mano a su espada y se
estuviera quedo, haciendo rostro a su enemigo, quedara el apaleado
agraviado y afrentado juntamente: agraviado, porque le dieron a traición;
afrentado, porque el que le dio sustentó lo que había hecho, sin volver las
espaldas y a pie quedo. Y así, según las leyes del maldito duelo, yo puedo
estar agraviado, mas no afrentado; porque los niños no sienten, ni las
mujeres, ni pueden huir, ni tienen para qué esperar, y lo mesmo los
constituidos en la sacra religión, porque estos tres géneros de gente
carecen de armas ofensivas y defensivas; y así, aunque naturalmente estén
obligados a defenderse, no lo están para ofender a nadie. Y, aunque poco ha
dije que yo podía estar agraviado, agora digo que no, en ninguna manera,
porque quien no puede recebir afrenta, menos la puede dar; por las cuales
razones yo no debo sentir, ni siento, las que aquel buen hombre me ha
dicho; sólo quisiera que esperara algún poco, para darle a entender en el
error en que está en pensar y decir que no ha habido, ni los hay,
caballeros andantes en el mundo; que si lo tal oyera Amadís, o uno de los
infinitos de su linaje, yo sé que no le fuera bien a su merced.
— Eso juro yo bien —dijo Sancho—: cuchillada le hubieran dado que le
abrieran de arriba abajo como una granada, o como a un melón muy maduro.
¡Bonitos eran ellos para sufrir semejantes cosquillas! Para mi santiguada,
que tengo por cierto que si Reinaldos de Montalbán hubiera oído estas
razones al hombrecito, tapaboca le hubiera dado que no hablara más en tres
años. ¡No, sino tomárase con ellos y viera cómo escapaba de sus manos!
Perecía de risa la duquesa en oyendo hablar a Sancho, y en su opinión le
tenía por más gracioso y por más loco que a su amo; y muchos hubo en aquel
tiempo que fueron deste mismo parecer. Finalmente, don Quijote se sosegó, y
la comida se acabó, y, en levantando los manteles, llegaron cuatro
doncellas, la una con una fuente de plata, y la otra con un aguamanil,
asimismo de plata, y la otra con dos blanquísimas y riquísimas toallas al
hombro, y la cuarta descubiertos los brazos hasta la mitad, y en sus
blancas manos —que sin duda eran blancas— una redonda pella de jabón
napolitano. Llegó la de la fuente, y con gentil donaire y desenvoltura
encajó la fuente debajo de la barba de don Quijote; el cual, sin hablar
palabra, admirado de semejante ceremonia, creyendo que debía ser usanza de
aquella tierra en lugar de las manos lavar las barbas, y así tendió la suya
todo cuanto pudo, y al mismo punto comenzó a llover el aguamanil, y la
doncella del jabón le manoseó las barbas con mucha priesa, levantando copos
de nieve, que no eran menos blancas las jabonaduras, no sólo por las
barbas, mas por todo el rostro y por los ojos del obediente caballero,
tanto, que se los hicieron cerrar por fuerza.
El duque y la duquesa, que de nada desto eran sabidores, estaban esperando
en qué había de parar tan extraordinario lavatorio. La doncella barbera,
cuando le tuvo con un palmo de jabonadura, fingió que se le había acabado
el agua, y mandó a la del aguamanil fuese por ella, que el señor don
Quijote esperaría. Hízolo así, y quedó don Quijote con la más estraña
figura y más para hacer reír que se pudiera imaginar.
Mirábanle todos los que presentes estaban, que eran muchos, y como le veían
con media vara de cuello, más que medianamente moreno, los ojos cerrados y
las barbas llenas de jabón, fue gran maravilla y mucha discreción poder
disimular la risa; las doncellas de la burla tenían los ojos bajos, sin
osar mirar a sus señores; a ellos les retozaba la cólera y la risa en el
cuerpo, y no sabían a qué acudir: o a castigar el atrevimiento de las
muchachas, o darles premio por el gusto que recibían de ver a don Quijote
de aquella suerte.
Finalmente, la doncella del aguamanil vino, y acabaron de lavar a don
Quijote, y luego la que traía las toallas le limpió y le enjugó muy
reposadamente; y, haciéndole todas cuatro a la par una grande y profunda
inclinación y reverencia, se querían ir; pero el duque, porque don Quijote
no cayese en la burla, llamó a la doncella de la fuente, diciéndole:
— Venid y lavadme a mí, y mirad que no se os acabe el agua.
La muchacha, aguda y diligente, llegó y puso la fuente al duque como a don
Quijote, y, dándose prisa, le lavaron y jabonaron muy bien, y, dejándole
enjuto y limpio, haciendo reverencias se fueron. Después se supo que había
jurado el duque que si a él no le lavaran como a don Quijote, había de
castigar su desenvoltura, lo cual habían enmendado discretamente con
haberle a él jabonado.
Estaba atento Sancho a las ceremonias de aquel lavatorio, y dijo entre sí:
— ¡Válame Dios! ¿Si será también usanza en esta tierra lavar las barbas a
los escuderos como a los caballeros? Porque, en Dios y en mi ánima que lo
he bien menester, y aun que si me las rapasen a navaja, lo tendría a más
beneficio.
— ¿Qué decís entre vos, Sancho? —preguntó la duquesa.
— Digo, señora —respondió él—, que en las cortes de los otros príncipes
siempre he oído decir que en levantando los manteles dan agua a las manos,
pero no lejía a las barbas; y que por eso es bueno vivir mucho, por ver
mucho; aunque también dicen que el que larga vida vive mucho mal ha de
pasar, puesto que pasar por un lavatorio de éstos antes es gusto que
trabajo.
— No tengáis pena, amigo Sancho —dijo la duquesa—, que yo haré que mis
doncellas os laven, y aun os metan en colada, si fuere menester.
— Con las barbas me contento —respondió Sancho—, por ahora a lo menos, que
andando el tiempo, Dios dijo lo que será.
— Mirad, maestresala —dijo la duquesa—, lo que el buen Sancho pide, y
cumplidle su voluntad al pie de la letra.
El maestresala respondió que en todo sería servido el señor Sancho, y con
esto se fue a comer, y llevó consigo a Sancho, quedándose a la mesa los
duques y don Quijote, hablando en muchas y diversas cosas; pero todas
tocantes al ejercicio de las armas y de la andante caballería.
La duquesa rogó a don Quijote que le delinease y describiese, pues parecía
tener felice memoria, la hermosura y facciones de la señora Dulcinea del
Toboso; que, según lo que la fama pregonaba de su belleza, tenía por
entendido que debía de ser la más bella criatura del orbe, y aun de toda la
Mancha. Sospiró don Quijote, oyendo lo que la duquesa le mandaba, y dijo:
— Si yo pudiera sacar mi corazón y ponerle ante los ojos de vuestra
grandeza, aquí, sobre esta mesa y en un plato, quitara el trabajo a mi
lengua de decir lo que apenas se puede pensar, porque Vuestra Excelencia la
viera en él toda retratada; pero, ¿para qué es ponerme yo ahora a delinear
y describir punto por punto y parte por parte la hermosura de la sin par
Dulcinea, siendo carga digna de otros hombros que de los míos, empresa en
quien se debían ocupar los pinceles de Parrasio, de Timantes y de Apeles, y
los buriles de Lisipo, para pintarla y grabarla en tablas, en mármoles y en
bronces, y la retórica ciceroniana y demostina para alabarla?
— ¿Qué quiere decir demostina, señor don Quijote —preguntó la duquesa—, que
es vocablo que no le he oído en todos los días de mi vida?
— Retórica demostina —respondió don Quijote— es lo mismo que decir retórica
de Demóstenes, como ciceroniana, de Cicerón, que fueron los dos mayores
retóricos del mundo.
— Así es —dijo el duque—, y habéis andado deslumbrada en la tal pregunta.
Pero, con todo eso, nos daría gran gusto el señor don Quijote si nos la
pintase; que a buen seguro que, aunque sea en rasguño y bosquejo, que ella
salga tal, que la tengan invidia las más hermosas.
— Sí hiciera, por cierto —respondió don Quijote—, si no me la hubiera
borrado de la idea la desgracia que poco ha que le sucedió, que es tal, que
más estoy para llorarla que para describirla; porque habrán de saber
vuestras grandezas que, yendo los días pasados a besarle las manos, y a
recebir su bendición, beneplácito y licencia para esta tercera salida,
hallé otra de la que buscaba: halléla encantada y convertida de princesa en
labradora, de hermosa en fea, de ángel en diablo, de olorosa en pestífera,
de bien hablada en rústica, de reposada en brincadora, de luz en tinieblas,
y, finalmente, de Dulcinea del Toboso en una villana de Sayago.
— ¡Válame Dios! —dando una gran voz, dijo a este instante el duque—. ¿Quién
ha sido el que tanto mal ha hecho al mundo? ¿Quién ha quitado dél la
belleza que le alegraba, el donaire que le entretenía y la honestidad que
le acreditaba?
— ¿Quién? —respondió don Quijote—. ¿Quién puede ser sino algún maligno
encantador de los muchos invidiosos que me persiguen? Esta raza maldita,
nacida en el mundo para escurecer y aniquilar las hazañas de los buenos, y
para dar luz y levantar los fechos de los malos. Perseguido me han
encantadores, encantadores me persiguen y encantadores me persiguirán hasta
dar conmigo y con mis altas caballerías en el profundo abismo del olvido; y
en aquella parte me dañan y hieren donde veen que más lo siento, porque
quitarle a un caballero andante su dama es quitarle los ojos con que mira,
y el sol con que se alumbra, y el sustento con que se mantiene. Otras
muchas veces lo he dicho, y ahora lo vuelvo a decir: que el caballero
andante sin dama es como el árbol sin hojas, el edificio sin cimiento y la
sombra sin cuerpo de quien se cause.
— No hay más que decir —dijo la duquesa—; pero si, con todo eso, hemos de
dar crédito a la historia que del señor don Quijote de pocos días a esta
parte ha salido a la luz del mundo, con general aplauso de las gentes,
della se colige, si mal no me acuerdo, que nunca vuesa merced ha visto a la
señora Dulcinea, y que esta tal señora no es en el mundo, sino que es dama
fantástica, que vuesa merced la engendró y parió en su entendimiento, y la
pintó con todas aquellas gracias y perfeciones que quiso.
— En eso hay mucho que decir —respondió don Quijote—. Dios sabe si hay
Dulcinea o no en el mundo, o si es fantástica o no es fantástica; y éstas
no son de las cosas cuya averiguación se ha de llevar hasta el cabo. Ni yo
engendré ni parí a mi señora, puesto que la contemplo como conviene que sea
una dama que contenga en sí las partes que puedan hacerla famosa en todas
las del mundo, como son: hermosa, sin tacha, grave sin soberbia, amorosa
con honestidad, agradecida por cortés, cortés por bien criada, y,
finalmente, alta por linaje, a causa que sobre la buena sangre resplandece
y campea la hermosura con más grados de perfeción que en las hermosas
humildemente nacidas.
— Así es —dijo el duque—; pero hame de dar licencia el señor don Quijote
para que diga lo que me fuerza a decir la historia que de sus hazañas he
leído, de donde se infiere que, puesto que se conceda que hay Dulcinea, en
el Toboso o fuera dél, y que sea hermosa en el sumo grado que vuesa merced
nos la pinta, en lo de la alteza del linaje no corre parejas con las
Orianas, con las Alastrajareas, con las Madásimas, ni con otras deste jaez,
de quien están llenas las historias que vuesa merced bien sabe.
— A eso puedo decir —respondió don Quijote— que Dulcinea es hija de sus
obras, y que las virtudes adoban la sangre, y que en más se ha de estimar y
tener un humilde virtuoso que un vicioso levantado; cuanto más, que
Dulcinea tiene un jirón que la puede llevar a ser reina de corona y ceptro;
que el merecimiento de una mujer hermosa y virtuosa a hacer mayores
milagros se estiende, y, aunque no formalmente, virtualmente tiene en sí
encerradas mayores venturas.
— Digo, señor don Quijote —dijo la duquesa—, que en todo cuanto vuestra
merced dice va con pie de plomo, y, como suele decirse, con la sonda en la
mano; y que yo desde aquí adelante creeré y haré creer a todos los de mi
casa, y aun al duque mi señor, si fuere menester, que hay Dulcinea en el
Toboso, y que vive hoy día, y es hermosa, y principalmente nacida y
merecedora que un tal caballero como es el señor don Quijote la sirva; que
es lo más que puedo ni sé encarecer. Pero no puedo dejar de formar un
escrúpulo, y tener algún no sé qué de ojeriza contra Sancho Panza: el
escrúpulo es que dice la historia referida que el tal Sancho Panza halló a
la tal señora Dulcinea, cuando de parte de vuestra merced le llevó una
epístola, ahechando un costal de trigo, y, por más señas, dice que era
rubión: cosa que me hace dudar en la alteza de su linaje.
A lo que respondió don Quijote:
— Señora mía, sabrá la vuestra grandeza que todas o las más cosas que a mí
me suceden van fuera de los términos ordinarios de las que a los otros
caballeros andantes acontecen, o ya sean encaminadas por el querer
inescrutable de los hados, o ya vengan encaminadas por la malicia de algún
encantador invidioso; y, como es cosa ya averiguada que todos o los más
caballeros andantes y famosos, uno tenga gracia de no poder ser encantado,
otro de ser de tan impenetrables carnes que no pueda ser herido, como lo
fue el famoso Roldán, uno de los doce Pares de Francia, de quien se cuenta
que no podía ser ferido sino por la planta del pie izquierdo, y que esto
había de ser con la punta de un alfiler gordo, y no con otra suerte de arma
alguna; y así, cuando Bernardo del Carpio le mató en Roncesvalles, viendo
que no le podía llagar con fierro, le levantó del suelo entre los brazos y
le ahogó, acordándose entonces de la muerte que dio Hércules a Anteón,
aquel feroz gigante que decían ser hijo de la Tierra. Quiero inferir de lo
dicho, que podría ser que yo tuviese alguna gracia déstas, no del no
poder ser ferido, porque muchas veces la experiencia me ha mostrado que soy
de carnes blandas y no nada impenetrables, ni la de no poder ser encantado,
que ya me he visto metido en una jaula, donde todo el mundo no fuera
poderoso a encerrarme, si no fuera a fuerzas de encantamentos; pero, pues
de aquél me libré, quiero creer que no ha de haber otro alguno que me
empezca; y así, viendo estos encantadores que con mi persona no pueden usar
de sus malas mañas, vénganse en las cosas que más quiero, y quieren
quitarme la vida maltratando la de Dulcinea, por quien yo vivo; y así, creo
que, cuando mi escudero le llevó mi embajada, se la convirtieron en villana
y ocupada en tan bajo ejercicio como es el de ahechar trigo; pero ya tengo
yo dicho que aquel trigo ni era rubión ni trigo, sino granos de perlas
orientales; y para prueba desta verdad quiero decir a vuestras magnitudes
cómo, viniendo poco ha por el Toboso, jamás pude hallar los palacios de
Dulcinea; y que otro día, habiéndola visto Sancho, mi escudero, en su mesma
figura, que es la más bella del orbe, a mí me pareció una labradora tosca y
fea, y no nada bien razonada, siendo la discreción del mundo; y, pues yo no
estoy encantado, ni lo puedo estar, según buen discurso, ella es la
encantada, la ofendida y la mudada, trocada y trastrocada, y en ella se han
vengado de mí mis enemigos, y por ella viviré yo en perpetuas lágrimas,
hasta verla en su prístino estado. Todo esto he dicho para que nadie repare
en lo que Sancho dijo del cernido ni del ahecho de Dulcinea; que, pues a mí
me la mudaron, no es maravilla que a él se la cambiasen. Dulcinea es
principal y bien nacida, y de los hidalgos linajes que hay en el Toboso,
que son muchos, antiguos y muy buenos, a buen seguro que no le cabe poca
parte a la sin par Dulcinea, por quien su lugar será famoso y nombrado en
los venideros siglos, como lo ha sido Troya por Elena, y España por la
Cava, aunque con mejor título y fama. Por otra parte, quiero que entiendan
vuestras señorías que Sancho Panza es uno de los más graciosos escuderos
que jamás sirvió a caballero andante; tiene a veces unas simplicidades tan
agudas, que el pensar si es simple o agudo causa no pequeño contento; tiene
malicias que le condenan por bellaco, y descuidos que le confirman por
bobo; duda de todo y créelo todo; cuando pienso que se va a despeñar de
tonto, sale con unas discreciones, que le levantan al cielo. Finalmente, yo
no le trocaría con otro escudero, aunque me diesen de añadidura una ciudad;
y así, estoy en duda si será bien enviarle al gobierno de quien vuestra
grandeza le ha hecho merced; aunque veo en él una cierta aptitud para esto
de gobernar, que atusándole tantico el entendimiento, se saldría con
cualquiera gobierno, como el rey con sus alcabalas; y más, que ya por
muchas experiencias sabemos que no es menester ni mucha habilidad ni muchas
letras para ser uno gobernador, pues hay por ahí ciento que apenas saber
leer, y gobiernan como unos girifaltes; el toque está en que tengan buena
intención y deseen acertar en todo; que nunca les faltará quien les
aconseje y encamine en lo que han de hacer, como los gobernadores
caballeros y no letrados, que sentencian con asesor. Aconsejaríale yo que
ni tome cohecho, ni pierda derecho, y otras cosillas que me quedan en el
estómago, que saldrán a su tiempo, para utilidad de Sancho y provecho de la
ínsula que gobernare.
A este punto llegaban de su coloquio el duque, la duquesa y don Quijote,
cuando oyeron muchas voces y gran rumor de gente en el palacio; y a deshora
entró Sancho en la sala, todo asustado, con un cernadero por babador, y
tras él muchos mozos, o, por mejor decir, pícaros de cocina y otra gente
menuda, y uno venía con un artesoncillo de agua, que en la color y poca
limpieza mostraba ser de fregar; seguíale y perseguíale el de la artesa, y
procuraba con toda solicitud ponérsela y encajársela debajo de las barbas,
y otro pícaro mostraba querérselas lavar.
— ¿Qué es esto, hermanos? —preguntó la duquesa—. ¿Qué es esto? ¿Qué queréis
a ese buen hombre? ¿Cómo y no consideráis que está electo gobernador?
A lo que respondió el pícaro barbero:
— No quiere este señor dejarse lavar, como es usanza, y como se la lavó el
duque mi señor y el señor su amo.
— Sí quiero —respondió Sancho con mucha cólera—, pero querría que fuese con
toallas más limpias, con lejía mas clara y con manos no tan sucias; que no
hay tanta diferencia de mí a mi amo, que a él le laven con agua de ángeles
y a mí con lejía de diablos. Las usanzas de las tierras y de los palacios
de los príncipes tanto son buenas cuanto no dan pesadumbre, pero la
costumbre del lavatorio que aquí se usa peor es que de diciplinantes. Yo
estoy limpio de barbas y no tengo necesidad de semejantes refrigerios; y el
que se llegare a lavarme ni a tocarme a un pelo de la cabeza, digo, de mi
barba, hablando con el debido acatamiento, le daré tal puñada que le deje
el puño engastado en los cascos; que estas tales ceremonias y jabonaduras
más parecen burlas que gasajos de huéspedes.
Perecida de risa estaba la duquesa, viendo la cólera y oyendo las razones
de Sancho, pero no dio mucho gusto a don Quijote verle tan mal adeliñado
con la jaspeada toalla, y tan rodeado de tantos entretenidos de cocina; y
así, haciendo una profunda reverencia a los duques, como que les pedía
licencia para hablar, con voz reposada dijo a la canalla:
— ¡Hola, señores caballeros! Vuesas mercedes dejen al mancebo, y vuélvanse
por donde vinieron, o por otra parte si se les antojare, que mi escudero es
limpio tanto como otro, y esas artesillas son para él estrechas y penantes
búcaros. Tomen mi consejo y déjenle, porque ni él ni yo sabemos de achaque
de burlas.
Cogióle la razón de la boca Sancho, y prosiguió diciendo:
— ¡No, sino lléguense a hacer burla del mostrenco, que así lo sufriré como
ahora es de noche! Traigan aquí un peine, o lo que quisieren, y almohácenme
estas barbas, y si sacaren dellas cosa que ofenda a la limpieza, que me
trasquilen a cruces.
A esta sazón, sin dejar la risa, dijo la duquesa:
— Sancho Panza tiene razón en todo cuanto ha dicho, y la tendrá en todo
cuanto dijere: él es limpio, y, como él dice, no tiene necesidad de
lavarse; y si nuestra usanza no le contenta, su alma en su palma, cuanto
más, que vosotros, ministros de la limpieza, habéis andado demasiadamente
de remisos y descuidados, y no sé si diga atrevidos, a traer a tal
personaje y a tales barbas, en lugar de fuentes y aguamaniles de oro puro y
de alemanas toallas, artesillas y dornajos de palo y rodillas de
aparadores. Pero, en fin, sois malos y mal nacidos, y no podéis dejar, como
malandrines que sois, de mostrar la ojeriza que tenéis con los escuderos de
los andantes caballeros.
Creyeron los apicarados ministros, y aun el maestresala, que venía con
ellos, que la duquesa hablaba de veras; y así, quitaron el cernadero del
pecho de Sancho, y todos confusos y casi corridos se fueron y le dejaron;
el cual, viéndose fuera de aquel, a su parecer, sumo peligro, se fue a
hincar de rodillas ante la duquesa y dijo:
— De grandes señoras, grandes mercedes se esperan; esta que la vuestra
merced hoy me ha fecho no puede pagarse con menos, si no es con desear
verme armado caballero andante, para ocuparme todos los días de mi vida en
servir a tan alta señora. Labrador soy, Sancho Panza me llamo, casado soy,
hijos tengo y de escudero sirvo: si con alguna destas cosas puedo servir a
vuestra grandeza, menos tardaré yo en obedecer que vuestra señoría en
mandar.
— Bien parece, Sancho —respondió la duquesa—, que habéis aprendido a ser
cortés en la escuela de la misma cortesía; bien parece, quiero decir, que
os habéis criado a los pechos del señor don Quijote, que debe de ser la
nata de los comedimientos y la flor de las ceremonias, o cirimonias, como
vos decís. Bien haya tal señor y tal criado: el uno, por norte de la
andante caballería; y el otro, por estrella de la escuderil fidelidad.
Levantaos, Sancho amigo, que yo satisfaré vuestras cortesías con hacer que
el duque mi señor, lo más presto que pudiere, os cumpla la merced prometida
del gobierno.
Con esto cesó la plática, y don Quijote se fue a reposar la siesta, y la
duquesa pidió a Sancho que, si no tenía mucha gana de dormir, viniese a
pasar la tarde con ella y con sus doncellas en una muy fresca sala. Sancho
respondió que, aunque era verdad que tenía por costumbre dormir cuatro o
cinco horas las siestas del verano, que, por servir a su bondad, él
procuraría con todas sus fuerzas no dormir aquel día ninguna, y vendría
obediente a su mandado, y fuese. El duque dio nuevas órdenes como se
tratase a don Quijote como a caballero andante, sin salir un punto del
estilo como cuentan que se trataban los antiguos caballeros.
Capítulo XXXIII. De la sabrosa plática que la duquesa y sus doncellas
pasaron con Sancho Panza, digna de que se lea y de que se note
Cuenta, pues, la historia, que Sancho no durmió aquella siesta, sino que,
por cumplir su palabra, vino en comiendo a ver a la duquesa; la cual, con
el gusto que tenía de oírle, le hizo sentar junto a sí en una silla baja,
aunque Sancho, de puro bien criado, no quería sentarse; pero la duquesa le
dijo que se sentase como gobernador y hablase como escudero, puesto que por
entrambas cosas merecía el mismo escaño del Cid Ruy Díaz Campeador.
Encogió Sancho los hombros, obedeció y sentóse, y todas las doncellas y
dueñas de la duquesa la rodearon, atentas, con grandísimo silencio, a
escuchar lo que diría; pero la duquesa fue la que habló primero, diciendo:
— Ahora que estamos solos, y que aquí no nos oye nadie, querría yo que el
señor gobernador me asolviese ciertas dudas que tengo, nacidas de la
historia que del gran don Quijote anda ya impresa; una de las cuales dudas
es que, pues el buen Sancho nunca vio a Dulcinea, digo, a la señora
Dulcinea del Toboso, ni le llevó la carta del señor don Quijote, porque se
quedó en el libro de memoria en Sierra Morena, cómo se atrevió a fingir la
respuesta, y aquello de que la halló ahechando trigo, siendo todo burla y
mentira, y tan en daño de la buena opinión de la sin par Dulcinea, y todas
que no vienen bien con la calidad y fidelidad de los buenos escuderos.
A estas razones, sin responder con alguna, se levantó Sancho de la silla,
y, con pasos quedos, el cuerpo agobiado y el dedo puesto sobre los labios,
anduvo por toda la sala levantando los doseles; y luego, esto hecho, se
volvió a sentar y dijo:
— Ahora, señora mía, que he visto que no nos escucha nadie de solapa, fuera
de los circunstantes, sin temor ni sobresalto responderé a lo que se me ha
preguntado, y a todo aquello que se me preguntare; y lo primero que digo es
que yo tengo a mi señor don Quijote por loco rematado, puesto que algunas
veces dice cosas que, a mi parecer, y aun de todos aquellos que le
escuchan, son tan discretas y por tan buen carril encaminadas, que el mesmo
Satanás no las podría decir mejores; pero, con todo esto, verdaderamente y
sin escrúpulo, a mí se me ha asentado que es un mentecato. Pues, como yo
tengo esto en el magín, me atrevo a hacerle creer lo que no lleva pies ni
cabeza, como fue aquello de la respuesta de la carta, y lo de habrá seis o
ocho días, que aún no está en historia; conviene a saber: lo del encanto de
mi señora doña Dulcinea, que le he dado a entender que está encantada, no
siendo más verdad que por los cerros de Úbeda.
Rogóle la duquesa que le contase aquel encantamento o burla, y Sancho se lo
contó todo del mesmo modo que había pasado, de que no poco gusto recibieron
los oyentes; y, prosiguiendo en su plática, dijo la duquesa:
— De lo que el buen Sancho me ha contado me anda brincando un escrúpulo en
el alma y un cierto susurro llega a mis oídos, que me dice: ''Pues don
Quijote de la Mancha es loco, menguado y mentecato, y Sancho Panza su
escudero lo conoce, y, con todo eso, le sirve y le sigue y va atenido a las
vanas promesas suyas, sin duda alguna debe de ser él más loco y tonto que
su amo; y, siendo esto así, como lo es, mal contado te será, señora
duquesa, si al tal Sancho Panza le das ínsula que gobierne, porque el que
no sabe gobernarse a sí, ¿cómo sabrá gobernar a otros?''
— Par Dios, señora —dijo Sancho—, que ese escrúpulo viene con parto derecho;
pero dígale vuesa merced que hable claro, o como quisiere, que yo conozco
que dice verdad: que si yo fuera discreto, días ha que había de haber
dejado a mi amo. Pero ésta fue mi suerte, y ésta mi malandanza; no puedo
más, seguirle tengo: somos de un mismo lugar, he comido su pan, quiérole
bien, es agradecido, diome sus pollinos, y, sobre todo, yo soy fiel; y así,
es imposible que nos pueda apartar otro suceso que el de la pala y azadón.
Y si vuestra altanería no quisiere que se me dé el prometido gobierno, de
menos me hizo Dios, y podría ser que el no dármele redundase en pro de mi
conciencia; que, maguera tonto, se me entiende aquel refrán de ''por su mal
le nacieron alas a la hormiga''; y aun podría ser que se fuese más aína
Sancho escudero al cielo, que no Sancho gobernador. Tan buen pan hacen aquí
como en Francia; y de noche todos los gatos son pardos, y asaz de
desdichada es la persona que a las dos de la tarde no se ha desayunado; y
no hay estómago que sea un palmo mayor que otro, el cual se puede llenar,
como suele decirse, de paja y de heno; y las avecitas del campo tienen a
Dios por su proveedor y despensero; y más calientan cuatro varas de paño de
Cuenca que otras cuatro de límiste de Segovia; y al dejar este mundo y
meternos la tierra adentro, por tan estrecha senda va el príncipe como el
jornalero, y no ocupa más pies de tierra el cuerpo del Papa que el del
sacristán, aunque sea más alto el uno que el otro; que al entrar en el hoyo
todos nos ajustamos y encogemos, o nos hacen ajustar y encoger, mal que nos
pese y a buenas noches. Y torno a decir que si vuestra señoría no me
quisiere dar la ínsula por tonto, yo sabré no dárseme nada por discreto; y
yo he oído decir que detrás de la cruz está el diablo, y que no es oro todo
lo que reluce, y que de entre los bueyes, arados y coyundas sacaron al
labrador Wamba para ser rey de España, y de entre los brocados, pasatiempos
y riquezas sacaron a Rodrigo para ser comido de culebras, si es que las
trovas de los romances antiguos no mienten.
— Y ¡cómo que no mienten! —dijo a esta sazón doña Rodríguez la dueña, que
era una de las escuchantes—: que un romance hay que dice que metieron al
rey Rodrigo, vivo vivo, en una tumba llena de sapos, culebras y lagartos, y
que de allí a dos días dijo el rey desde dentro de la tumba, con voz
doliente y baja:
Ya me comen, ya me comen
por do más pecado había;
y, según esto, mucha razón tiene este señor en decir que quiere más ser más
labrador que rey, si le han de comer sabandijas.
No pudo la duquesa tener la risa, oyendo la simplicidad de su dueña, ni
dejó de admirarse en oír las razones y refranes de Sancho, a quien dijo:
— Ya sabe el buen Sancho que lo que una vez promete un caballero procura
cumplirlo, aunque le cueste la vida. El duque, mi señor y marido, aunque no
es de los andantes, no por eso deja de ser caballero, y así, cumplirá la
palabra de la prometida ínsula, a pesar de la invidia y de la malicia del
mundo. Esté Sancho de buen ánimo, que cuando menos lo piense se verá
sentado en la silla de su ínsula y en la de su estado, y empuñará su
gobierno, que con otro de brocado de tres altos lo deseche. Lo que yo le
encargo es que mire cómo gobierna sus vasallos, advirtiendo que todos son
leales y bien nacidos.
— Eso de gobernarlos bien —respondió Sancho— no hay para qué encargármelo,
porque yo soy caritativo de mío y tengo compasión de los pobres; y a quien
cuece y amasa, no le hurtes hogaza; y para mi santiguada que no me han de
echar dado falso; soy perro viejo, y entiendo todo tus, tus, y sé
despabilarme a sus tiempos, y no consiento que me anden musarañas ante los
ojos, porque sé dónde me aprieta el zapato: dígolo porque los buenos
tendrán conmigo mano y concavidad, y los malos, ni pie ni entrada. Y
paréceme a mí que en esto de los gobiernos todo es comenzar, y podría ser
que a quince días de gobernador me comiese las manos tras el oficio y
supiese más dél que de la labor del campo, en que me he criado.
— Vos tenéis razón razón, Sancho —dijo la duquesa—, que nadie nace enseñado,
y de los hombres se hacen los obispos, que no de las piedras. Pero,
volviendo a la plática que poco ha tratábamos del encanto de la señora
Dulcinea, tengo por cosa cierta y más que averiguada que aquella
imaginación que Sancho tuvo de burlar a su señor y darle a entender que la
labradora era Dulcinea, y que si su señor no la conocía debía de ser por
estar encantada, toda fue invención de alguno de los encantadores que al
señor don Quijote persiguen; porque real y verdaderamente yo sé de buena
parte que la villana que dio el brinco sobre la pollina era y es Dulcinea
del Toboso, y que el buen Sancho, pensando ser el engañador, es el
engañado; y no hay poner más duda en esta verdad que en las cosas que nunca
vimos; y sepa el señor Sancho Panza que también tenemos acá encantadores
que nos quieren bien, y nos dicen lo que pasa por el mundo, pura y
sencillamente, sin enredos ni máquinas; y créame Sancho que la villana
brincadora era y es Dulcinea del Toboso, que está encantada como la madre
que la parió; y cuando menos nos pensemos, la habemos de ver en su propia
figura, y entonces saldrá Sancho del engaño en que vive.
— Bien puede ser todo eso —dijo Sancho Panza—; y agora quiero creer lo que
mi amo cuenta de lo que vio en la cueva de Montesinos, donde dice que vio a
la señora Dulcinea del Toboso en el mesmo traje y hábito que yo dije que la
había visto cuando la encanté por solo mi gusto; y todo debió de ser al
revés, como vuesa merced, señora mía, dice, porque de mi ruin ingenio no se
puede ni debe presumir que fabricase en un instante tan agudo embuste, ni
creo yo que mi amo es tan loco que con tan flaca y magra persuasión como la
mía creyese una cosa tan fuera de todo término. Pero, señora, no por esto
será bien que vuestra bondad me tenga por malévolo, pues no está obligado
un porro como yo a taladrar los pensamientos y malicias de los pésimos
encantadores: yo fingí aquello por escaparme de las riñas de mi señor don
Quijote, y no con intención de ofenderle; y si ha salido al revés, Dios
está en el cielo, que juzga los corazones.
— Así es la verdad —dijo la duquesa—; pero dígame agora, Sancho, qué es esto
que dice de la cueva de Montesinos, que gustaría saberlo.
Entonces Sancho Panza le contó punto por punto lo que queda dicho acerca de
la tal aventura. Oyendo lo cual la duquesa, dijo:
— Deste suceso se puede inferir que, pues el gran don Quijote dice que vio
allí a la mesma labradora que Sancho vio a la salida del Toboso, sin duda
es Dulcinea, y que andan por aquí los encantadores muy listos y
demasiadamente curiosos.
— Eso digo yo —dijo Sancho Panza—, que si mi señora Dulcinea del Toboso está
encantada, su daño; que yo no me tengo de tomar, yo, con los enemigos de mi
amo, que deben de ser muchos y malos. Verdad sea que la que yo vi fue una
labradora, y por labradora la tuve, y por tal labradora la juzgué; y si
aquélla era Dulcinea, no ha de estar a mi cuenta, ni ha de correr por mí, o
sobre ello, morena. No, sino ándense a cada triquete conmigo a dime y
direte, "Sancho lo dijo, Sancho lo hizo, Sancho tornó y Sancho volvió",
como si Sancho fuese algún quienquiera, y no fuese el mismo Sancho Panza,
el que anda ya en libros por ese mundo adelante, según me dijo Sansón
Carrasco, que, por lo menos, es persona bachillerada por Salamanca, y los
tales no pueden mentir si no es cuando se les antoja o les viene muy a
cuento; así que, no hay para qué nadie se tome conmigo, y pues que tengo
buena fama, y, según oí decir a mi señor, que más vale el buen nombre que
las muchas riquezas, encájenme ese gobierno y verán maravillas; que quien
ha sido buen escudero será buen gobernador.
— Todo cuanto aquí ha dicho el buen Sancho —dijo la duquesa— son sentencias
catonianas, o, por lo menos, sacadas de las mesmas entrañas del mismo
Micael Verino, florentibus occidit annis. En fin, en fin, hablando a su
modo, debajo de mala capa suele haber buen bebedor.
— En verdad, señora —respondió Sancho—, que en mi vida he bebido de malicia;
con sed bien podría ser, porque no tengo nada de hipócrita: bebo cuando
tengo gana, y cuando no la tengo y cuando me lo dan, por no parecer o
melindroso o malcriado; que a un brindis de un amigo, ¿qué corazón ha de
haber tan de mármol que no haga la razón? Pero, aunque las calzo, no las
ensucio; cuanto más, que los escuderos de los caballeros andantes, casi de
ordinario beben agua, porque siempre andan por florestas, selvas y prados,
montañas y riscos, sin hallar una misericordia de vino, si dan por ella un
ojo.
— Yo lo creo así —respondió la duquesa—. Y por ahora, váyase Sancho a
reposar, que después hablaremos más largo y daremos orden como vaya presto
a encajarse, como él dice, aquel gobierno.
De nuevo le besó las manos Sancho a la duquesa, y le suplicó le hiciese
merced de que se tuviese buena cuenta con su rucio, porque era la lumbre de
sus ojos.
— ¿Qué rucio es éste? —preguntó la duquesa.
— Mi asno —respondió Sancho—, que por no nombrarle con este nombre, le suelo
llamar el rucio; y a esta señora dueña le rogué, cuando entré en este
castillo, tuviese cuenta con él, y azoróse de manera como si la hubiera
dicho que era fea o vieja, debiendo ser más propio y natural de las dueñas
pensar jumentos que autorizar las salas. ¡Oh, válame Dios, y cuán mal
estaba con estas señoras un hidalgo de mi lugar!
— Sería algún villano —dijo doña Rodríguez, la dueña—, que si él fuera
hidalgo y bien nacido, él las pusiera sobre el cuerno de la luna.
— Agora bien —dijo la duquesa—, no haya más: calle doña Rodríguez y
sosiéguese el señor Panza, y quédese a mi cargo el regalo del rucio; que,
por ser alhaja de Sancho, le pondré yo sobre las niñas de mis ojos.
— En la caballeriza basta que esté —respondió Sancho—, que sobre las niñas
de los ojos de vuestra grandeza ni él ni yo somos dignos de estar sólo un
momento, y así lo consintiría yo como darme de puñaladas; que, aunque dice
mi señor que en las cortesías antes se ha de perder por carta de más que de
menos, en las jumentiles y así niñas se ha de ir con el compás en la mano y
con medido término.
— Llévele —dijo la duquesa— Sancho al gobierno, y allá le podrá regalar como
quisiere, y aun jubilarle del trabajo.
— No piense vuesa merced, señora duquesa, que ha dicho mucho —dijo Sancho—;
que yo he visto ir más de dos asnos a los gobiernos, y que llevase yo el
mío no sería cosa nueva.
Las razones de Sancho renovaron en la duquesa la risa y el contento; y,
enviándole a reposar, ella fue a dar cuenta al duque de lo que con él había
pasado, y entre los dos dieron traza y orden de hacer una burla a don
Quijote que fuese famosa y viniese bien con el estilo caballeresco, en el
cual le hicieron muchas, tan propias y discretas, que son las mejores
aventuras que en esta grande historia se contienen.
Capítulo XXXIV. Que cuenta de la noticia que se tuvo de cómo se había de
desencantar la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso, que es una de las aventuras más
famosas deste libro
Grande era el gusto que recebían el duque y la duquesa de la conversación
de don Quijote y de la de Sancho Panza; y, confirmándose en la intención
que tenían de hacerles algunas burlas que llevasen vislumbres y apariencias
de aventuras, tomaron motivo de la que don Quijote ya les había contado de
la cueva de Montesinos, para hacerle una que fuese famosa (pero de lo que
más la duquesa se admiraba era que la simplicidad de Sancho fuese tanta que
hubiese venido a creer ser verdad infalible que Dulcinea del Toboso
estuviese encantada, habiendo sido él mesmo el encantador y el embustero de
aquel negocio); y así, habiendo dado orden a sus criados de todo lo que
habían de hacer, de allí a seis días le llevaron a caza de montería, con
tanto aparato de monteros y cazadores como pudiera llevar un rey coronado.
Diéronle a don Quijote un vestido de monte y a Sancho otro verde, de
finísimo paño; pero don Quijote no se le quiso poner, diciendo que otro día
había de volver al duro ejercicio de las armas y que no podía llevar
consigo guardarropas ni reposterías. Sancho sí tomó el que le dieron, con
intención de venderle en la primera ocasión que pudiese.
Llegado, pues, el esperado día, armóse don Quijote, vistióse Sancho, y,
encima de su rucio, que no le quiso dejar aunque le daban un caballo, se
metió entre la tropa de los monteros. La duquesa salió bizarramente
aderezada, y don Quijote, de puro cortés y comedido, tomó la rienda de su
palafrén, aunque el duque no quería consentirlo, y, finalmente, llegaron a
un bosque que entre dos altísimas montañas estaba, donde, tomados los
puestos, paranzas y veredas, y repartida la gente por diferentes puestos,
se comenzó la caza con grande estruendo, grita y vocería, de manera que
unos a otros no podían oírse, así por el ladrido de los perros como por el
son de las bocinas.
Apeóse la duquesa, y, con un agudo venablo en las manos, se puso en un
puesto por donde ella sabía que solían venir algunos jabalíes. Apeóse
asimismo el duque y don Quijote, y pusiéronse a sus lados; Sancho se puso
detrás de todos, sin apearse del rucio, a quien no osara desamparar, porque
no le sucediese algún desmán. Y, apenas habían sentado el pie y puesto en
ala con otros muchos criados suyos, cuando, acosado de los perros y seguido
de los cazadores, vieron que hacia ellos venía un desmesurado jabalí,
crujiendo dientes y colmillos y arrojando espuma por la boca; y en
viéndole, embrazando su escudo y puesta mano a su espada, se adelantó a
recebirle don Quijote. Lo mesmo hizo el duque con su venablo; pero a todos
se adelantara la duquesa, si el duque no se lo estorbara. Sólo Sancho, en
viendo al valiente animal, desamparó al rucio y dio a correr cuanto pudo,
y, procurando subirse sobre una alta encina, no fue posible; antes, estando
ya a la mitad dél, asido de una rama, pugnando subir a la cima, fue tan
corto de ventura y tan desgraciado, que se desgajó la rama, y, al venir al
suelo, se quedó en el aire, asido de un gancho de la encina, sin poder
llegar al suelo. Y, viéndose así, y que el sayo verde se le rasgaba, y
pareciéndole que si aquel fiero animal allí allegaba le podía alcanzar,
comenzó a dar tantos gritos y a pedir socorro con tanto ahínco, que todos
los que le oían y no le veían creyeron que estaba entre los dientes de
alguna fiera.
Finalmente, el colmilludo jabalí quedó atravesado de las cuchillas de
muchos venablos que se le pusieron delante; y, volviendo la cabeza don
Quijote a los gritos de Sancho, que ya por ellos le había conocido, viole
pendiente de la encina y la cabeza abajo, y al rucio junto a él, que no le
desamparó en su calamidad; y dice Cide Hamete que pocas veces vio a Sancho
Panza sin ver al rucio, ni al rucio sin ver a Sancho: tal era la amistad y
buena fe que entre los dos se guardaban.
Llegó don Quijote y descolgó a Sancho; el cual, viéndose libre y en el
suelo, miró lo desgarrado del sayo de monte, y pesóle en el alma; que pensó
que tenía en el vestido un mayorazgo. En esto, atravesaron al jabalí
poderoso sobre una acémila, y, cubriéndole con matas de romero y con ramas
de mirto, le llevaron, como en señal de vitoriosos despojos, a unas grandes
tiendas de campaña que en la mitad del bosque estaban puestas, donde
hallaron las mesas en orden y la comida aderezada, tan sumptuosa y grande,
que se echaba bien de ver en ella la grandeza y magnificencia de quien la
daba. Sancho, mostrando las llagas a la duquesa de su roto vestido, dijo:
— Si esta caza fuera de liebres o de pajarillos, seguro estuviera mi sayo de
verse en este estremo. Yo no sé qué gusto se recibe de esperar a un animal
que, si os alcanza con un colmillo, os puede quitar la vida; yo me acuerdo
haber oído cantar un romance antiguo que dice:
De los osos seas comido,
como Favila el nombrado.
— Ése fue un rey godo —dijo don Quijote—, que, yendo a caza de montería, le
comió un oso.
— Eso es lo que yo digo —respondió Sancho—: que no querría yo que los
príncipes y los reyes se pusiesen en semejantes peligros, a trueco de un
gusto que parece que no le había de ser, pues consiste en matar a un animal
que no ha cometido delito alguno.
— Antes os engañáis, Sancho —respondió el duque—, porque el ejercicio de la
caza de monte es el más conveniente y necesario para los reyes y príncipes
que otro alguno. La caza es una imagen de la guerra: hay en ella
estratagemas, astucias, insidias para vencer a su salvo al enemigo;
padécense en ella fríos grandísimos y calores intolerables; menoscábase el
ocio y el sueño, corrobóranse las fuerzas, agilítanse los miembros del que
la usa, y, en resolución, es ejercicio que se puede hacer sin perjuicio de
nadie y con gusto de muchos; y lo mejor que él tiene es que no es para
todos, como lo es el de los otros géneros de caza, excepto el de la
volatería, que también es sólo para reyes y grandes señores. Así que, ¡oh
Sancho!, mudad de opinión, y, cuando seáis gobernador, ocupaos en la caza y
veréis como os vale un pan por ciento.
— Eso no —respondió Sancho—: el buen gobernador, la pierna quebrada y en
casa. ¡Bueno sería que viniesen los negociantes a buscarle fatigados y él
estuviese en el monte holgándose! ¡Así enhoramala andaría el gobierno! Mía
fe, señor, la caza y los pasatiempos más han de ser para los holgazanes que
para los gobernadores. En lo que yo pienso entretenerme es en jugar al
triunfo envidado las pascuas, y a los bolos los domingos y fiestas; que
esas cazas ni cazos no dicen con mi condición ni hacen con mi conciencia.
— Plega a Dios, Sancho, que así sea, porque del dicho al hecho hay gran
trecho.
— Haya lo que hubiere —replicó Sancho—, que al buen pagador no le duelen
prendas, y más vale al que Dios ayuda que al que mucho madruga, y tripas
llevan pies, que no pies a tripas; quiero decir que si Dios me ayuda, y yo
hago lo que debo con buena intención, sin duda que gobernaré mejor que un
gerifalte. ¡No, sino pónganme el dedo en la boca y verán si aprieto o no!
— ¡Maldito seas de Dios y de todos sus santos, Sancho maldito —dijo don
Quijote—, y cuándo será el día, como otras muchas veces he dicho, donde yo
te vea hablar sin refranes una razón corriente y concertada! Vuestras
grandezas dejen a este tonto, señores míos, que les molerá las almas, no
sólo puestas entre dos, sino entre dos mil refranes, traídos tan a sazón y
tan a tiempo cuanto le dé Dios a él la salud, o a mí si los querría
escuchar.
— Los refranes de Sancho Panza —dijo la duquesa—, puesto que son más que los
del Comendador Griego, no por eso son en menos de estimar, por la brevedad
de las sentencias. De mí sé decir que me dan más gusto que otros, aunque
sean mejor traídos y con más sazón acomodados.
Con estos y otros entretenidos razonamientos, salieron de la tienda al
bosque, y en requerir algunas paranzas, y presto, se les pasó el día y se
les vino la noche, y no tan clara ni tan sesga como la sazón del tiempo
pedía, que era en la mitad del verano; pero un cierto claroescuro que trujo
consigo ayudó mucho a la intención de los duques; y, así como comenzó a
anochecer, un poco más adelante del crepúsculo, a deshora pareció que todo
el bosque por todas cuatro partes se ardía, y luego se oyeron por aquí y
por allí, y por acá y por acullá, infinitas cornetas y otros instrumentos
de guerra, como de muchas tropas de caballería que por el bosque pasaba. La
luz del fuego, el son de los bélicos instrumentos, casi cegaron y atronaron
los ojos y los oídos de los circunstantes, y aun de todos los que en el
bosque estaban. Luego se oyeron infinitos lelilíes, al uso de moros cuando
entran en las batallas, sonaron trompetas y clarines, retumbaron tambores,
resonaron pífaros, casi todos a un tiempo, tan contino y tan apriesa, que
no tuviera sentido el que no quedara sin él al son confuso de tantos
intrumentos. Pasmóse el duque, suspendióse la duquesa, admiróse don
Quijote, tembló Sancho Panza, y, finalmente, aun hasta los mesmos sabidores
de la causa se espantaron. Con el temor les cogió el silencio, y un
postillón que en traje de demonio les pasó por delante, tocando en voz de
corneta un hueco y desmesurado cuerno, que un ronco y espantoso son
despedía.
— ¡Hola, hermano correo! —dijo el duque—, ¿quién sois, adónde vais, y qué
gente de guerra es la que por este bosque parece que atraviesa?
A lo que respondió el correo con voz horrísona y desenfadada:
— Yo soy el Diablo; voy a buscar a don Quijote de la Mancha; la gente que
por aquí viene son seis tropas de encantadores, que sobre un carro
triunfante traen a la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso. Encantada viene con el
gallardo francés Montesinos, a dar orden a don Quijote de cómo ha de ser
desencantada la tal señora.
— Si vos fuérades diablo, como decís y como vuestra figura muestra, ya
hubiérades conocido al tal caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, pues le
tenéis delante.
— En Dios y en mi conciencia —respondió el Diablo— que no miraba en ello,
porque traigo en tantas cosas divertidos los pensamientos, que de la
principal a que venía se me olvidaba.
— Sin duda —dijo Sancho— que este demonio debe de ser hombre de bien y buen
cristiano, porque, a no serlo, no jurara en Dios y en mi conciencia. Ahora
yo tengo para mí que aun en el mesmo infierno debe de haber buena gente.
Luego el Demonio, sin apearse, encaminando la vista a don Quijote, dijo:
— A ti, el Caballero de los Leones (que entre las garras dellos te vea yo),
me envía el desgraciado pero valiente caballero Montesinos, mandándome que
de su parte te diga que le esperes en el mismo lugar que te topare, a causa
que trae consigo a la que llaman Dulcinea del Toboso, con orden de darte la
que es menester para desencantarla. Y, por no ser para más mi venida, no ha
de ser más mi estada: los demonios como yo queden contigo, y los ángeles
buenos con estos señores.
Y, en diciendo esto, tocó el desaforado cuerno, y volvió las espaldas y
fuese, sin esperar respuesta de ninguno.
Renovóse la admiración en todos, especialmente en Sancho y don Quijote: en
Sancho, en ver que, a despecho de la verdad, querían que estuviese
encantada Dulcinea; en don Quijote, por no poder asegurarse si era verdad o
no lo que le había pasado en la cueva de Montesinos. Y, estando elevado en
estos pensamientos, el duque le dijo:
— ¿Piensa vuestra merced esperar, señor don Quijote?
— Pues ¿no? —respondió él—. Aquí esperaré intrépido y fuerte, si me viniese
a embestir todo el infierno.
— Pues si yo veo otro diablo y oigo otro cuerno como el pasado, así esperaré
yo aquí como en Flandes —dijo Sancho.
En esto, se cerró más la noche, y comenzaron a discurrir muchas luces por
el bosque, bien así como discurren por el cielo las exhalaciones secas de
la tierra, que parecen a nuestra vista estrellas que corren. Oyóse asimismo
un espantoso ruido, al modo de aquel que se causa de las ruedas macizas que
suelen traer los carros de bueyes, de cuyo chirrío áspero y continuado se
dice que huyen los lobos y los osos, si los hay por donde pasan. Añadióse a
toda esta tempestad otra que las aumentó todas, que fue que parecía
verdaderamente que a las cuatro partes del bosque se estaban dando a un
mismo tiempo cuatro rencuentros o batallas, porque allí sonaba el duro
estruendo de espantosa artillería, acullá se disparaban infinitas
escopetas, cerca casi sonaban las voces de los combatientes, lejos se
reiteraban los lililíes agarenos.
Finalmente, las cornetas, los cuernos, las bocinas, los clarines, las
trompetas, los tambores, la artillería, los arcabuces, y, sobre todo, el
temeroso ruido de los carros, formaban todos juntos un son tan confuso y
tan horrendo, que fue menester que don Quijote se valiese de todo su
corazón para sufrirle; pero el de Sancho vino a tierra, y dio con él
desmayado en las faldas de la duquesa, la cual le recibió en ellas, y a
gran priesa mandó que le echasen agua en el rostro. Hízose así, y él volvió
en su acuerdo, a tiempo que ya un carro de las rechinantes ruedas llegaba a
aquel puesto.
Tirábanle cuatro perezosos bueyes, todos cubiertos de paramentos negros; en
cada cuerno traían atada y encendida una grande hacha de cera, y encima del
carro venía hecho un asiento alto, sobre el cual venía sentado un venerable
viejo, con una barba más blanca que la mesma nieve, y tan luenga que le
pasaba de la cintura; su vestidura era una ropa larga de negro bocací, que,
por venir el carro lleno de infinitas luces, se podía bien divisar y
discernir todo lo que en él venía. Guiábanle dos feos demonios vestidos del
mesmo bocací, con tan feos rostros, que Sancho, habiéndolos visto una vez,
cerró los ojos por no verlos otra. Llegando, pues, el carro a igualar al
puesto, se levantó de su alto asiento el viejo venerable, y, puesto en pie,
dando una gran voz, dijo:
— Yo soy el sabio Lirgandeo.
Y pasó el carro adelante, sin hablar más palabra. Tras éste pasó otro carro
de la misma manera, con otro viejo entronizado; el cual, haciendo que el
carro se detuviese, con voz no menos grave que el otro, dijo:
— Yo soy el sabio Alquife, el grande amigo de Urganda la Desconocida.
Y pasó adelante.
Luego, por el mismo continente, llegó otro carro; pero el que venía sentado
en el trono no era viejo como los demás, sino hombrón robusto y de mala
catadura, el cual, al llegar, levantándose en pie, como los otros, dijo con
voz más ronca y más endiablada:
— Yo soy Arcaláus el encantador, enemigo mortal de Amadís de Gaula y de toda
su parentela.
Y pasó adelante. Poco desviados de allí hicieron alto estos tres carros, y
cesó el enfadoso ruido de sus ruedas, y luego se oyó otro, no ruido, sino
un son de una suave y concertada música formado, con que Sancho se alegró,
y lo tuvo a buena señal; y así, dijo a la duquesa, de quien un punto ni un
paso se apartaba:
— Señora, donde hay música no puede haber cosa mala.
— Tampoco donde hay luces y claridad —respondió la duquesa.
A lo que replicó Sancho:
— Luz da el fuego y claridad las hogueras, como lo vemos en las que nos
cercan, y bien podría ser que nos abrasasen, pero la música siempre es
indicio de regocijos y de fiestas.
— Ello dirá —dijo don Quijote, que todo lo escuchaba.
Y dijo bien, como se muestra en el capítulo siguiente.
Capítulo XXXV. Donde se prosigue la noticia que tuvo don Quijote del
desencanto de Dulcinea, con otros admirables sucesos
Al compás de la agradable música vieron que hacia ellos venía un carro de
los que llaman triunfales tirado de seis mulas pardas, encubertadas,
empero, de lienzo blanco, y sobre cada una venía un diciplinante de luz,
asimesmo vestido de blanco, con una hacha de cera grande encendida en la
mano. Era el carro dos veces, y aun tres, mayor que los pasados, y los
lados, y encima dél, ocupaban doce otros diciplinantes albos como la nieve,
todos con sus hachas encendidas, vista que admiraba y espantaba juntamente;
y en un levantado trono venía sentada una ninfa, vestida de mil velos de
tela de plata, brillando por todos ellos infinitas hojas de argentería de
oro, que la hacían, si no rica, a lo menos vistosamente vestida. Traía el
rostro cubierto con un transparente y delicado cendal, de modo que, sin
impedirlo sus lizos, por entre ellos se descubría un hermosísimo rostro de
doncella, y las muchas luces daban lugar para distinguir la belleza y los
años, que, al parecer, no llegaban a veinte ni bajaban de diez y siete.
Junto a ella venía una figura vestida de una ropa de las que llaman
rozagantes, hasta los pies, cubierta la cabeza con un velo negro; pero, al
punto que llegó el carro a estar frente a frente de los duques y de don
Quijote, cesó la música de las chirimías, y luego la de las arpas y laúdes
que en el carro sonaban; y, levantándose en pie la figura de la ropa, la
apartó a entrambos lados, y, quitándose el velo del rostro, descubrió
patentemente ser la mesma figura de la muerte, descarnada y fea, de que don
Quijote recibió pesadumbre y Sancho miedo, y los duques hicieron algún
sentimiento temeroso. Alzada y puesta en pie esta muerte viva, con voz algo
dormida y con lengua no muy despierta, comenzó a decir desta manera:
-Yo soy Merlín, aquel que las historias
dicen que tuve por mi padre al diablo
(mentira autorizada de los tiempos),
príncipe de la Mágica y monarca
y archivo de la ciencia zoroástrica,
émulo a las edades y a los siglos
que solapar pretenden las hazañas
de los andantes bravos caballeros
a quien yo tuve y tengo gran cariño.
Y, puesto que es de los encantadores,
de los magos o mágicos contino
dura la condición, áspera y fuerte,
la mía es tierna, blanda y amorosa,
y amiga de hacer bien a todas gentes.
En las cavernas lóbregas de Dite,
donde estaba mi alma entretenida
en formar ciertos rombos y caráteres,
llegó la voz doliente de la bella
y sin par Dulcinea del Toboso.
Supe su encantamento y su desgracia,
y su trasformación de gentil dama
en rústica aldeana; condolíme,
y, encerrando mi espíritu en el hueco
desta espantosa y fiera notomía,
después de haber revuelto cien mil libros
desta mi ciencia endemoniada y torpe,
vengo a dar el remedio que conviene
a tamaño dolor, a mal tamaño.
¡Oh tú, gloria y honor de cuantos visten
las túnicas de acero y de diamante,
luz y farol, sendero, norte y guía
de aquellos que, dejando el torpe sueño
y las ociosas plumas, se acomodan
a usar el ejercicio intolerable
de las sangrientas y pesadas armas!
A ti digo ¡oh varón, como se debe
por jamás alabado!, a ti, valiente
juntamente y discreto don Quijote,
de la Mancha esplendor, de España estrella,
que para recobrar su estado primo
la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso,
es menester que Sancho, tu escudero,
se dé tres mil azotes y trecientos
en ambas sus valientes posaderas,
al aire descubiertas, y de modo
que le escuezan, le amarguen y le enfaden.
Y en esto se resuelven todos cuantos
de su desgracia han sido los autores,
y a esto es mi venida, mis señores.
— ¡Voto a tal! —dijo a esta sazón Sancho—. No digo yo tres mil azotes, pero
así me daré yo tres como tres puñaladas. ¡Válate el diablo por modo de
desencantar! ¡Yo no sé qué tienen que ver mis posas con los encantos! ¡Par
Dios que si el señor Merlín no ha hallado otra manera como desencantar a la
señora Dulcinea del Toboso, encantada se podrá ir a la sepultura!
— Tomaros he yo —dijo don Quijote—, don villano, harto de ajos, y amarraros
he a un árbol, desnudo como vuestra madre os parió; y no digo yo tres mil y
trecientos, sino seis mil y seiscientos azotes os daré, tan bien pegados
que no se os caigan a tres mil y trecientos tirones. Y no me repliquéis
palabra, que os arrancaré el alma.
Oyendo lo cual Merlín, dijo:
— No ha de ser así, porque los azotes que ha de recebir el buen Sancho han
de ser por su voluntad, y no por fuerza, y en el tiempo que él quisiere;
que no se le pone término señalado; pero permítesele que si él quisiere
redemir su vejación por la mitad de este vapulamiento, puede dejar que se
los dé ajena mano, aunque sea algo pesada.
— Ni ajena, ni propia, ni pesada, ni por pesar —replicó Sancho—: a mí no me
ha de tocar alguna mano. ¿Parí yo, por ventura, a la señora Dulcinea del
Toboso, para que paguen mis posas lo que pecaron sus ojos? El señor mi amo
sí, que es parte suya, pues la llama a cada paso mi vida, mi alma, sustento
y arrimo suyo, se puede y debe azotar por ella y hacer todas las
diligencias necesarias para su desencanto; pero, ¿azotarme yo...?
¡Abernuncio!
Apenas acabó de decir esto Sancho, cuando, levantándose en pie la argentada
ninfa que junto al espíritu de Merlín venía, quitándose el sutil velo del
rostro, le descubrió tal, que a todos pareció mas que demasiadamente
hermoso, y, con un desenfado varonil y con una voz no muy adamada, hablando
derechamente con Sancho Panza, dijo:
— ¡Oh malaventurado escudero, alma de cántaro, corazón de alcornoque, de
entrañas guijeñas y apedernaladas! Si te mandaran, ladrón desuellacaras,
que te arrojaras de una alta torre al suelo; si te pidieran, enemigo del
género humano, que te comieras una docena de sapos, dos de lagartos y tres
de culebras; si te persuadieran a que mataras a tu mujer y a tus hijos con
algún truculento y agudo alfanje, no fuera maravilla que te mostraras
melindroso y esquivo; pero hacer caso de tres mil y trecientos azotes, que
no hay niño de la doctrina, por ruin que sea, que no se los lleve cada mes,
admira, adarva, espanta a todas las entrañas piadosas de los que lo
escuchan, y aun las de todos aquellos que lo vinieren a saber con el
discurso del tiempo. Pon, ¡oh miserable y endurecido animal!, pon, digo,
esos tus ojos de machuelo espantadizo en las niñas destos míos, comparados
a rutilantes estrellas, y veráslos llorar hilo a hilo y madeja a madeja,
haciendo surcos, carreras y sendas por los hermosos campos de mis mejillas.
Muévate, socarrón y malintencionado monstro, que la edad tan florida mía,
que aún se está todavía en el diez y... de los años, pues tengo diez y
nueve y no llego a veinte, se consume y marchita debajo de la corteza de
una rústica labradora; y si ahora no lo parezco, es merced particular que
me ha hecho el señor Merlín, que está presente, sólo porque te enternezca
mi belleza; que las lágrimas de una afligida hermosura vuelven en algodón
los riscos, y los tigres en ovejas. Date, date en esas carnazas, bestión
indómito, y saca de harón ese brío, que a sólo comer y más comer te
inclina, y pon en libertad la lisura de mis carnes, la mansedumbre de mi
condición y la belleza de mi faz; y si por mí no quieres ablandarte ni
reducirte a algún razonable término, hazlo por ese pobre caballero que a tu
lado tienes; por tu amo, digo, de quien estoy viendo el alma, que la tiene
atravesada en la garganta, no diez dedos de los labios, que no espera sino
tu rígida o blanda repuesta, o para salirse por la boca, o para volverse al
estómago.
Tentóse, oyendo esto, la garganta don Quijote y dijo, volviéndose al duque:
— Por Dios, señor, que Dulcinea ha dicho la verdad, que aquí tengo el alma
atravesada en la garganta, como una nuez de ballesta.
— ¿Qué decís vos a esto, Sancho? —preguntó la duquesa.
— Digo, señora —respondió Sancho—, lo que tengo dicho: que de los azotes,
abernuncio.
— Abrenuncio habéis de decir, Sancho, y no como decís —dijo el duque.
— Déjeme vuestra grandeza —respondió Sancho—, que no estoy agora para mirar
en sotilezas ni en letras más a menos; porque me tienen tan turbado estos
azotes que me han de dar, o me tengo de dar, que no sé lo que me digo, ni
lo que me hago. Pero querría yo saber de la señora mi señora doña Dulcina
del Toboso adónde aprendió el modo de rogar que tiene: viene a pedirme que
me abra las carnes a azotes, y llámame alma de cántaro y bestión indómito,
con una tiramira de malos nombres, que el diablo los sufra. ¿Por ventura
son mis carnes de bronce, o vame a mí algo en que se desencante o no? ¿Qué
canasta de ropa blanca, de camisas, de tocadores y de escarpines, anque
no los gasto, trae delante de sí para ablandarme, sino un vituperio y otro,
sabiendo aquel refrán que dicen por ahí, que un asno cargado de oro sube
ligero por una montaña, y que dádivas quebrantan peñas, y a Dios rogando y
con el mazo dando, y que más vale un "toma" que dos "te daré"? Pues el
señor mi amo, que había de traerme la mano por el cerro y halagarme para
que yo me hiciese de lana y de algodón cardado, dice que si me coge me
amarrará desnudo a un árbol y me doblará la parada de los azotes; y habían
de considerar estos lastimados señores que no solamente piden que se azote
un escudero, sino un gobernador; como quien dice: "bebe con guindas".
Aprendan, aprendan mucho de enhoramala a saber rogar, y a saber pedir, y a
tener crianza, que no son todos los tiempos unos, ni están los hombres
siempre de un buen humor. Estoy yo ahora reventando de pena por ver mi sayo
verde roto, y vienen a pedirme que me azote de mi voluntad, estando ella
tan ajena dello como de volverme cacique.
— Pues en verdad, amigo Sancho —dijo el duque—, que si no os ablandáis más
que una breva madura, que no habéis de empuñar el gobierno. ¡Bueno sería
que yo enviase a mis insulanos un gobernador cruel, de entrañas
pedernalinas, que no se doblega a las lágrimas de las afligidas doncellas,
ni a los ruegos de discretos, imperiosos y antiguos encantadores y sabios!
En resolución, Sancho, o vos habéis de ser azotado, o os han de azotar, o
no habéis de ser gobernador.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, ¿no se me darían dos días de término para pensar
lo que me está mejor?
— No, en ninguna manera —dijo Merlín—; aquí, en este instante y en este
lugar, ha de quedar asentado lo que ha de ser deste negocio, o Dulcinea
volverá a la cueva de Montesinos y a su prístino estado de labradora, o ya,
en el ser que está, será llevada a los Elíseos Campos, donde estará
esperando se cumpla el número del vápulo.
— Ea, buen Sancho —dijo la duquesa—, buen ánimo y buena correspondencia al
pan que habéis comido del señor don Quijote, a quien todos debemos servir y
agradar, por su buena condición y por sus altas caballerías. Dad el sí,
hijo, desta azotaina, y váyase el diablo para diablo y el temor para
mezquino; que un buen corazón quebranta mala ventura, como vos bien sabéis.
A estas razones respondió con éstas disparatadas Sancho, que, hablando con
Merlín, le preguntó:
— Dígame vuesa merced, señor Merlín: cuando llegó aquí el diablo correo y
dio a mi amo un recado del señor Montesinos, mandándole de su parte que le
esperase aquí, porque venía a dar orden de que la señora doña Dulcinea del
Toboso se desencantase, y hasta agora no hemos visto a Montesinos, ni a sus
semejas.
A lo cual respondió Merlín:
— El Diablo, amigo Sancho, es un ignorante y un grandísimo bellaco: yo le
envié en busca de vuestro amo, pero no con recado de Montesinos, sino mío,
porque Montesinos se está en su cueva entendiendo, o, por mejor decir,
esperando su desencanto, que aún le falta la cola por desollar. Si os debe
algo, o tenéis alguna cosa que negociar con él, yo os lo traeré y pondré
donde vos más quisiéredes. Y, por agora, acabad de dar el sí desta
diciplina, y creedme que os será de mucho provecho, así para el alma como
para el cuerpo: para el alma, por la caridad con que la haréis; para el
cuerpo, porque yo sé que sois de complexión sanguínea, y no os podrá hacer
daño sacaros un poco de sangre.
— Muchos médicos hay en el mundo: hasta los encantadores son médicos
— replicó Sancho—; pero, pues todos me lo dicen, aunque yo no me lo veo,
digo que soy contento de darme los tres mil y trecientos azotes, con
condición que me los tengo de dar cada y cuando que yo quisiere, sin que se
me ponga tasa en los días ni en el tiempo; y yo procuraré salir de la deuda
lo más presto que sea posible, porque goce el mundo de la hermosura de la
señora doña Dulcinea del Toboso, pues, según parece, al revés de lo que yo
pensaba, en efecto es hermosa. Ha de ser también condición que no he de
estar obligado a sacarme sangre con la diciplina, y que si algunos azotes
fueren de mosqueo, se me han de tomar en cuenta. Iten, que si me errare en
el número, el señor Merlín, pues lo sabe todo, ha de tener cuidado de
contarlos y de avisarme los que me faltan o los que me sobran.
— De las sobras no habrá que avisar —respondió Merlín—, porque, llegando al
cabal número, luego quedará de improviso desencantada la señora Dulcinea, y
vendrá a buscar, como agradecida, al buen Sancho, y a darle gracias, y aun
premios, por la buena obra. Así que no hay de qué tener escrúpulo de las
sobras ni de las faltas, ni el cielo permita que yo engañe a nadie, aunque
sea en un pelo de la cabeza.
— ¡Ea, pues, a la mano de Dios! —dijo Sancho—. Yo consiento en mi mala
ventura; digo que yo acepto la penitencia con las condiciones apuntadas.
Apenas dijo estas últimas palabras Sancho, cuando volvió a sonar la música
de las chirimías y se volvieron a disparar infinitos arcabuces, y don
Quijote se colgó del cuello de Sancho, dándole mil besos en la frente y en
las mejillas. La duquesa y el duque y todos los circunstantes dieron
muestras de haber recebido grandísimo contento, y el carro comenzó a
caminar; y, al pasar, la hermosa Dulcinea inclinó la cabeza a los duques y
hizo una gran reverencia a Sancho.
Y ya, en esto, se venía a más andar el alba, alegre y risueña: las
florecillas de los campos se descollaban y erguían, y los líquidos
cristales de los arroyuelos, murmurando por entre blancas y pardas guijas,
iban a dar tributo a los ríos que los esperaban. La tierra alegre, el cielo
claro, el aire limpio, la luz serena, cada uno por sí y todos juntos, daban
manifiestas señales que el día, que al aurora venía pisando las faldas,
había de ser sereno y claro. Y, satisfechos los duques de la caza y de
haber conseguido su intención tan discreta y felicemente, se volvieron a su
castillo, con prosupuesto de segundar en sus burlas, que para ellos no
había veras que más gusto les diesen.
Capítulo XXXVI. Donde se cuenta la estraña y jamás imaginada aventura de la
dueña Dolorida, alias de la condesa Trifaldi, con una carta que Sancho
Panza escribió a su mujer Teresa Panza
Tenía un mayordomo el duque de muy burlesco y desenfadado ingenio, el cual
hizo la figura de Merlín y acomodó todo el aparato de la aventura pasada,
compuso los versos y hizo que un paje hiciese a Dulcinea. Finalmente, con
intervención de sus señores, ordenó otra del más gracioso y estraño
artificio que puede imaginarse.
Preguntó la duquesa a Sancho otro día si había comenzado la tarea de la
penitencia que había de hacer por el desencanto de Dulcinea. Dijo que sí,
y que aquella noche se había dado cinco azotes. Preguntóle la duquesa que
con qué se los había dado. Respondió que con la mano.
— Eso —replicó la duquesa— más es darse de palmadas que de azotes. Yo tengo
para mí que el sabio Merlín no estará contento con tanta blandura; menester
será que el buen Sancho haga alguna diciplina de abrojos, o de las de
canelones, que se dejen sentir; porque la letra con sangre entra, y no se
ha de dar tan barata la libertad de una tan gran señora como lo es Dulcinea
por tan poco precio; y advierta Sancho que las obras de caridad que se
hacen tibia y flojamente no tienen mérito ni valen nada.
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— Déme vuestra señoría alguna diciplina o ramal conveniente, que yo me daré
con él como no me duela demasiado, porque hago saber a vuesa merced que,
aunque soy rústico, mis carnes tienen más de algodón que de esparto, y no
será bien que yo me descríe por el provecho ajeno.
— Sea en buena hora —respondió la duquesa—: yo os daré mañana una diciplina
que os venga muy al justo y se acomode con la ternura de vuestras carnes,
como si fueran sus hermanas propias.
A lo que dijo Sancho:
— Sepa vuestra alteza, señora mía de mi ánima, que yo tengo escrita una
carta a mi mujer Teresa Panza, dándole cuenta de todo lo que me ha sucedido
después que me aparté della; aquí la tengo en el seno, que no le falta más
de ponerle el sobreescrito; querría que vuestra discreción la leyese,
porque me parece que va conforme a lo de gobernador, digo, al modo que
deben de escribir los gobernadores.
— ¿Y quién la notó? —preguntó la duquesa.
— ¿Quién la había de notar sino yo, pecador de mí? —respondió Sancho.
— ¿Y escribístesla vos? —dijo la duquesa.
— Ni por pienso —respondió Sancho—, porque yo no sé leer ni escribir, puesto
que sé firmar.
— Veámosla —dijo la duquesa—, que a buen seguro que vos mostréis en ella la
calidad y suficiencia de vuestro ingenio.
Sacó Sancho una carta abierta del seno, y, tomándola la duquesa, vio que
decía desta manera:
Carta de Sancho Panza a Teresa Panza, su mujer
Si buenos azotes me daban, bien caballero me iba; si buen gobierno me
tengo, buenos azotes me cuesta. Esto no lo entenderás tú, Teresa mía, por
ahora; otra vez lo sabrás. Has de saber, Teresa, que tengo determinado que
andes en coche, que es lo que hace al caso, porque todo otro andar es andar
a gatas. Mujer de un gobernador eres, ¡mira si te roerá nadie los zancajos!
Ahí te envío un vestido verde de cazador, que me dio mi señora la duquesa;
acomódale en modo que sirva de saya y cuerpos a nuestra hija. Don Quijote,
mi amo, según he oído decir en esta tierra, es un loco cuerdo y un
mentecato gracioso, y que yo no le voy en zaga. Hemos estado en la cueva de
Montesinos, y el sabio Merlín ha echado mano de mí para el desencanto de
Dulcinea del Toboso, que por allá se llama Aldonza Lorenzo: con tres mil y
trecientos azotes, menos cinco, que me he de dar, quedará desencantada como
la madre que la parió. No dirás desto nada a nadie, porque pon lo tuyo en
concejo, y unos dirán que es blanco y otros que es negro. De aquí a pocos
días me partiré al gobierno, adonde voy con grandísimo deseo de hacer
dineros, porque me han dicho que todos los gobernadores nuevos van con este
mesmo deseo; tomaréle el pulso, y avisaréte si has de venir a estar conmigo
o no. El rucio está bueno, y se te encomienda mucho; y no le pienso dejar,
aunque me llevaran a ser Gran Turco. La duquesa mi señora te besa mil veces
las manos; vuélvele el retorno con dos mil, que no hay cosa que menos
cueste ni valga más barata, según dice mi amo, que los buenos
comedimientos. No ha sido Dios servido de depararme otra maleta con otros
cien escudos, como la de marras, pero no te dé pena, Teresa mía, que en
salvo está el que repica, y todo saldrá en la colada del gobierno; sino que
me ha dado gran pena que me dicen que si una vez le pruebo, que me tengo de
comer las manos tras él; y si así fuese, no me costaría muy barato, aunque
los estropeados y mancos ya se tienen su calonjía en la limosna que piden;
así que, por una vía o por otra, tú has de ser rica, de buena ventura. Dios
te la dé, como puede, y a mí me guarde para servirte. Deste castillo, a
veinte de julio de 1614.
Tu marido el gobernador,
Sancho Panza.
En acabando la duquesa de leer la carta, dijo a Sancho:
— En dos cosas anda un poco descaminado el buen gobernador: la una, en decir
o dar a entender que este gobierno se le han dado por los azotes que se ha
de dar, sabiendo él, que no lo puede negar, que cuando el duque, mi señor,
se le prometió, no se soñaba haber azotes en el mundo; la otra es que se
muestra en ella muy codicioso, y no querría que orégano fuese, porque la
codicia rompe el saco, y el gobernador codicioso hace la justicia
desgobernada.
— Yo no lo digo por tanto, señora —respondió Sancho—; y si a vuesa merced le
parece que la tal carta no va como ha de ir, no hay sino rasgarla y hacer
otra nueva, y podría ser que fuese peor si me lo dejan a mi caletre.
— No, no —replicó la duquesa—, buena está ésta, y quiero que el duque la
vea.
Con esto se fueron a un jardín, donde habían de comer aquel día. Mostró la
duquesa la carta de Sancho al duque, de que recibió grandísimo contento.
Comieron, y después de alzado los manteles, y después de haberse
entretenido un buen espacio con la sabrosa conversación de Sancho, a
deshora se oyó el son tristísimo de un pífaro y el de un ronco y
destemplado tambor. Todos mostraron alborotarse con la confusa, marcial y
triste armonía, especialmente don Quijote, que no cabía en su asiento de
puro alborotado; de Sancho no hay que decir sino que el miedo le llevó a su
acostumbrado refugio, que era el lado o faldas de la duquesa, porque real y
verdaderamente el son que se escuchaba era tristísimo y malencólico.
Y, estando todos así suspensos, vieron entrar por el jardín adelante dos
hombres vestidos de luto, tan luego y tendido que les arrastraba por el
suelo; éstos venían tocando dos grandes tambores, asimismo cubiertos de
negro. A su lado venía el pífaro, negro y pizmiento como los demás. Seguía
a los tres un personaje de cuerpo agigantado, amantado, no que vestido, con
una negrísima loba, cuya falda era asimismo desaforada de grande. Por
encima de la loba le ceñía y atravesaba un ancho tahelí, también negro, de
quien pendía un desmesurado alfanje de guarniciones y vaina negra. Venía
cubierto el rostro con un trasparente velo negro, por quien se entreparecía
una longísima barba, blanca como la nieve. Movía el paso al son de los
tambores con mucha gravedad y reposo. En fin, su grandeza, su contoneo, su
negrura y su acompañamiento pudiera y pudo suspender a todos aquellos que
sin conocerle le miraron.
Llegó, pues, con el espacio y prosopopeya referida a hincarse de rodillas
ante el duque, que en pie, con los demás que allí estaban, le atendía; pero
el duque en ninguna manera le consintió hablar hasta que se levantase.
Hízolo así el espantajo prodigioso, y, puesto en pie, alzó el antifaz del
rostro y hizo patente la más horrenda, la más larga, la más blanca y más
poblada barba que hasta entonces humanos ojos habían visto, y luego
desencajó y arrancó del ancho y dilatado pecho una voz grave y sonora, y,
poniendo los ojos en el duque, dijo:
— Altísimo y poderoso señor, a mí me llaman Trifaldín el de la Barba Blanca;
soy escudero de la condesa Trifaldi, por otro nombre llamada la Dueña
Dolorida, de parte de la cual traigo a vuestra grandeza una embajada, y es
que la vuestra magnificencia sea servida de darla facultad y licencia para
entrar a decirle su cuita, que es una de las más nuevas y más admirables
que el más cuitado pensamiento del orbe pueda haber pensado. Y primero
quiere saber si está en este vuestro castillo el valeroso y jamás vencido
caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, en cuya busca viene a pie y sin
desayunarse desde el reino de Candaya hasta este vuestro estado, cosa que
se puede y debe tener a milagro o a fuerza de encantamento. Ella queda a la
puerta desta fortaleza o casa de campo, y no aguarda para entrar sino
vuestro beneplácito. Dije.
Y tosió luego y manoseóse la barba de arriba abajo con entrambas manos, y
con mucho sosiego estuvo atendiendo la respuesta del duque, que fue:
— Ya, buen escudero Trifaldín de la Blanca Barba, ha muchos días que tenemos
noticia de la desgracia de mi señora la condesa Trifaldi, a quien los
encantadores la hacen llamar la Dueña Dolorida; bien podéis, estupendo
escudero, decirle que entre y que aquí está el valiente caballero don
Quijote de la Mancha, de cuya condición generosa puede prometerse con
seguridad todo amparo y toda ayuda; y asimismo le podréis decir de mi parte
que si mi favor le fuere necesario, no le ha de faltar, pues ya me tiene
obligado a dársele el ser caballero, a quien es anejo y concerniente
favorecer a toda suerte de mujeres, en especial a las dueñas viudas,
menoscabadas y doloridas, cual lo debe estar su señoría.
Oyendo lo cual Trifaldín, inclinó la rodilla hasta el suelo, y, haciendo al
pífaro y tambores señal que tocasen, al mismo son y al mismo paso que había
entrado, se volvió a salir del jardín, dejando a todos admirados de su
presencia y compostura. Y, volviéndose el duque a don Quijote, le dijo:
— En fin, famoso caballero, no pueden las tinieblas de malicia ni de la
ignorancia encubrir y escurecer la luz del valor y de la virtud. Digo esto
porque apenas ha seis días que la vuestra bondad está en este castillo,
cuando ya os vienen a buscar de lueñas y apartadas tierras, y no en
carrozas ni en dromedarios, sino a pie y en ayunas; los tristes, los
afligidos, confiados que han de hallar en ese fortísimo brazo el remedio de
sus cuitas y trabajos, merced a vuestras grandes hazañas, que corren y
rodean todo lo descubierto de la tierra.
— Quisiera yo, señor duque —respondió don Quijote—, que estuviera aquí
presente aquel bendito religioso que a la mesa el otro día mostró tener tan
mal talante y tan mala ojeriza contra los caballeros andantes, para que
viera por vista de ojos si los tales caballeros son necesarios en el mundo:
tocara, por lo menos, con la mano que los extraordinariamente afligidos y
desconsolados, en casos grandes y en desdichas inormes no van a buscar su
remedio a las casas de los letrados, ni a la de los sacristanes de las
aldeas, ni al caballero que nunca ha acertado a salir de los términos de su
lugar, ni al perezoso cortesano que antes busca nuevas para referirlas y
contarlas, que procura hacer obras y hazañas para que otros las cuenten y
las escriban; el remedio de las cuitas, el socorro de las necesidades, el
amparo de las doncellas, el consuelo de las viudas, en ninguna suerte de
personas se halla mejor que en los caballeros andantes, y de serlo yo doy
infinitas gracias al cielo, y doy por muy bien empleado cualquier desmán y
trabajo que en este tan honroso ejercicio pueda sucederme. Venga esta dueña
y pida lo que quisiere, que yo le libraré su remedio en la fuerza de mi
brazo y en la intrépida resolución de mi animoso espíritu.
Capítulo XXXVII. Donde se prosigue la famosa aventura de la dueña Dolorida
En estremo se holgaron el duque y la duquesa de ver cuán bien iba
respondiendo a su intención don Quijote, y a esta sazón dijo Sancho:
— No querría yo que esta señora dueña pusiese algún tropiezo a la promesa de
mi gobierno, porque yo he oído decir a un boticario toledano que hablaba
como un silguero que donde interviniesen dueñas no podía suceder cosa
buena. ¡Válame Dios, y qué mal estaba con ellas el tal boticario! De lo que
yo saco que, pues todas las dueñas son enfadosas e impertinentes, de
cualquiera calidad y condición que sean, ¿qué serán las que son doloridas,
como han dicho que es esta condesa Tres Faldas, o Tres Colas?; que en mi
tierra faldas y colas, colas y faldas, todo es uno.
— Calla, Sancho amigo —dijo don Quijote—, que, pues esta señora dueña de tan
lueñes tierras viene a buscarme, no debe ser de aquellas que el boticario
tenía en su número, cuanto más que ésta es condesa, y cuando las condesas
sirven de dueñas, será sirviendo a reinas y a emperatrices, que en sus
casas son señorísimas que se sirven de otras dueñas.
A esto respondió doña Rodríguez, que se halló presente:
— Dueñas tiene mi señora la duquesa en su servicio, que pudieran ser
condesas si la fortuna quisiera, pero allá van leyes do quieren reyes; y
nadie diga mal de las dueñas, y más de las antiguas y doncellas; que,
aunque yo no lo soy, bien se me alcanza y se me trasluce la ventaja que
hace una dueña doncella a una dueña viuda; y quien a nosotras trasquiló,
las tijeras le quedaron en la mano.
— Con todo eso —replicó Sancho—, hay tanto que trasquilar en las dueñas,
según mi barbero, cuanto será mejor no menear el arroz, aunque se pegue.
— Siempre los escuderos —respondió doña Rodríguez— son enemigos nuestros;
que, como son duendes de las antesalas y nos veen a cada paso, los ratos
que no rezan, que son muchos, los gastan en murmurar de nosotras,
desenterrándonos los huesos y enterrándonos la fama. Pues mándoles yo a los
leños movibles, que, mal que les pese, hemos de vivir en el mundo, y en las
casas principales, aunque muramos de hambre y cubramos con un negro monjil
nuestras delicadas o no delicadas carnes, como quien cubre o tapa un
muladar con un tapiz en día de procesión. A fe que si me fuera dado, y el
tiempo lo pidiera, que yo diera a entender, no sólo a los presentes, sino a
todo el mundo, cómo no hay virtud que no se encierre en una dueña.
— Yo creo —dijo la duquesa— que mi buena doña Rodríguez tiene razón, y muy
grande; pero conviene que aguarde tiempo para volver por sí y por las demás
dueñas, para confundir la mala opinión de aquel mal boticario, y
desarraigar la que tiene en su pecho el gran Sancho Panza.
A lo que Sancho respondió:
— Después que tengo humos de gobernador se me han quitado los váguidos de
escudero, y no se me da por cuantas dueñas hay un cabrahígo.
Adelante pasaran con el coloquio dueñesco, si no oyeran que el pífaro y los
tambores volvían a sonar, por donde entendieron que la dueña Dolorida
entraba. Preguntó la duquesa al duque si sería bien ir a recebirla, pues
era condesa y persona principal.
— Por lo que tiene de condesa —respondió Sancho, antes que el duque
respondiese—, bien estoy en que vuestras grandezas salgan a recebirla; pero
por lo de dueña, soy de parecer que no se muevan un paso.
— ¿Quién te mete a ti en esto, Sancho? —dijo don Quijote.
— ¿Quién, señor? —respondió Sancho—. Yo me meto, que puedo meterme, como
escudero que ha aprendido los términos de la cortesía en la escuela de
vuesa merced, que es el más cortés y bien criado caballero que hay en toda
la cortesanía; y en estas cosas, según he oído decir a vuesa merced, tanto
se pierde por carta de más como por carta de menos; y al buen entendedor,
pocas palabras.
— Así es, como Sancho dice —dijo el duque—: veremos el talle de la condesa,
y por él tantearemos la cortesía que se le debe.
En esto, entraron los tambores y el pífaro, como la vez primera.
Y aquí, con este breve capítulo, dio fin el autor, y comenzó el otro,
siguiendo la mesma aventura, que es una de las más notables de la historia.
Capítulo XXXVIII. Donde se cuenta la que dio de su mala andanza la dueña
Dolorida
Detrás de los tristes músicos comenzaron a entrar por el jardín adelante
hasta cantidad de doce dueñas, repartidas en dos hileras, todas vestidas de
unos monjiles anchos, al parecer, de anascote batanado, con unas tocas
blancas de delgado canequí, tan luengas que sólo el ribete del monjil
descubrían. Tras ellas venía la condesa Trifaldi, a quien traía de la mano
el escudero Trifaldín de la Blanca Barba, vestida de finísima y negra
bayeta por frisar, que, a venir frisada, descubriera cada grano del grandor
de un garbanzo de los buenos de Martos. La cola, o falda, o como llamarla
quisieren, era de tres puntas, las cuales se sustentaban en las manos de
tres pajes, asimesmo vestidos de luto, haciendo una vistosa y matemática
figura con aquellos tres ángulos acutos que las tres puntas formaban, por
lo cual cayeron todos los que la falda puntiaguda miraron que por ella se
debía llamar la condesa Trifaldi, como si dijésemos la condesa de las Tres
Faldas; y así dice Benengeli que fue verdad, y que de su propio apellido se
llama la condesa Lobuna, a causa que se criaban en su condado muchos lobos,
y que si como eran lobos fueran zorras, la llamaran la condesa Zorruna, por
ser costumbre en aquellas partes tomar los señores la denominación de sus
nombres de la cosa o cosas en que más sus estados abundan; empero esta
condesa, por favorecer la novedad de su falda, dejó el Lobuna y tomó el
Trifaldi.
Venían las doce dueñas y la señora a paso de procesión, cubiertos los
rostros con unos velos negros y no trasparentes como el de Trifaldín, sino
tan apretados que ninguna cosa se traslucían.
Así como acabó de parecer el dueñesco escuadrón, el duque, la duquesa y don
Quijote se pusieron en pie, y todos aquellos que la espaciosa procesión
miraban. Pararon las doce dueñas y hicieron calle, por medio de la cual la
Dolorida se adelantó, sin dejarla de la mano Trifaldín, viendo lo cual el
duque, la duquesa y don Quijote, se adelantaron obra de doce pasos a
recebirla. Ella, puesta las rodillas en el suelo, con voz antes basta y
ronca que sutil y dilicada, dijo:
— Vuestras grandezas sean servidas de no hacer tanta cortesía a este su
criado; digo, a esta su criada, porque, según soy de dolorida, no acertaré
a responder a lo que debo, a causa que mi estraña y jamás vista desdicha me
ha llevado el entendimiento no sé adónde, y debe de ser muy lejos, pues
cuanto más le busco menos le hallo.
— Sin él estaría —respondió el duque—, señora condesa, el que no descubriese
por vuestra persona vuestro valor, el cual, sin más ver, es merecedor de
toda la nata de la cortesía y de toda la flor de las bien criadas
ceremonias.
Y, levantándola de la mano, la llevó a asentar en una silla junto a la
duquesa, la cual la recibió asimismo con mucho comedimiento.
Don Quijote callaba, y Sancho andaba muerto por ver el rostro de la
Trifaldi y de alguna de sus muchas dueñas, pero no fue posible hasta que
ellas de su grado y voluntad se descubrieron.
Sosegados todos y puestos en silencio, estaban esperando quién le había de
romper, y fue la dueña Dolorida con estas palabras:
— Confiada estoy, señor poderosísimo, hermosísima señora y discretísimos
circunstantes, que ha de hallar mi cuitísima en vuestros valerosísimos
pechos acogimiento no menos plácido que generoso y doloroso, porque ella es
tal, que es bastante a enternecer los mármoles, y a ablandar los diamantes,
y a molificar los aceros de los más endurecidos corazones del mundo; pero,
antes que salga a la plaza de vuestros oídos, por no decir orejas, quisiera
que me hicieran sabidora si está en este gremio, corro y compañía el
acendradísimo caballero don Quijote de la Manchísima y su escuderísimo
Panza.
— El Panza —antes que otro respondiese, dijo Sancho— aquí esta, y el don
Quijotísimo asimismo; y así, podréis, dolorosísima dueñísima, decir lo que
quisieridísimis, que todos estamos prontos y aparejadísimos a ser vuestros
servidorísimos.
En esto se levantó don Quijote, y, encaminando sus razones a la Dolorida
dueña, dijo:
— Si vuestras cuitas, angustiada señora, se pueden prometer alguna esperanza
de remedio por algún valor o fuerzas de algún andante caballero, aquí están
las mías, que, aunque flacas y breves, todas se emplearán en vuestro
servicio. Yo soy don Quijote de la Mancha, cuyo asumpto es acudir a toda
suerte de menesterosos, y, siendo esto así, como lo es, no habéis menester,
señora, captar benevolencias ni buscar preámbulos, sino, a la llana y sin
rodeos, decir vuestros males, que oídos os escuchan que sabrán, si no
remediarlos, dolerse dellos.
Oyendo lo cual, la Dolorida dueña hizo señal de querer arrojarse a los pies
de don Quijote, y aun se arrojó, y, pugnando por abrazárselos, decía:
— Ante estos pies y piernas me arrojo, ¡oh caballero invicto!, por ser los
que son basas y colunas de la andante caballería; estos pies quiero besar,
de cuyos pasos pende y cuelga todo el remedio de mi desgracia, ¡oh valeroso
andante, cuyas verdaderas fazañas dejan atrás y escurecen las fabulosas de
los Amadises, Esplandianes y Belianises!
Y, dejando a don Quijote, se volvió a Sancho Panza, y, asiéndole de las
manos, le dijo:
— ¡Oh tú, el más leal escudero que jamás sirvió a caballero andante en los
presentes ni en los pasados siglos, más luengo en bondad que la barba de
Trifaldín, mi acompañador, que está presente!, bien puedes preciarte que en
servir al gran don Quijote sirves en cifra a toda la caterva de caballeros
que han tratado las armas en el mundo. Conjúrote, por lo que debes a tu
bondad fidelísima, me seas buen intercesor con tu dueño, para que luego
favorezca a esta humilísima y desdichadísima condesa.
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— De que sea mi bondad, señoría mía, tan larga y grande como la barba de
vuestro escudero, a mí me hace muy poco al caso; barbada y con bigotes
tenga yo mi alma cuando desta vida vaya, que es lo que importa, que de las
barbas de acá poco o nada me curo; pero, sin esas socaliñas ni plegarias,
yo rogaré a mi amo, que sé que me quiere bien, y más agora que me ha
menester para cierto negocio, que favorezca y ayude a vuesa merced en todo
lo que pudiere. Vuesa merced desembaúle su cuita y cuéntenosla, y deje
hacer, que todos nos entenderemos.
Reventaban de risa con estas cosas los duques, como aquellos que habían
tomado el pulso a la tal aventura, y alababan entre sí la agudeza y
disimulación de la Trifaldi, la cual, volviéndose a sentar, dijo:
— «Del famoso reino de Candaya, que cae entre la gran Trapobana y el mar del
Sur, dos leguas más allá del cabo Comorín, fue señora la reina doña
Maguncia, viuda del rey Archipiela, su señor y marido, de cuyo matrimonio
tuvieron y procrearon a la infanta Antonomasia, heredera del reino, la cual
dicha infanta Antonomasia se crió y creció debajo de mi tutela y doctrina,
por ser yo la más antigua y la más principal dueña de su madre. Sucedió,
pues, que, yendo días y viniendo días, la niña Antonomasia llegó a edad de
catorce años, con tan gran perfeción de hermosura, que no la pudo subir más
de punto la naturaleza. ¡Pues digamos agora que la discreción era mocosa!
Así era discreta como bella, y era la más bella del mundo, y lo es, si ya
los hados invidiosos y las parcas endurecidas no la han cortado la estambre
de la vida. Pero no habrán, que no han de permitir los cielos que se haga
tanto mal a la tierra como sería llevarse en agraz el racimo del más
hermoso veduño del suelo. De esta hermosura, y no como se debe encarecida
de mi torpe lengua, se enamoró un número infinito de príncipes, así
naturales como estranjeros, entre los cuales osó levantar los pensamientos
al cielo de tanta belleza un caballero particular que en la corte estaba,
confiado en su mocedad y en su bizarría, y en sus muchas habilidades y
gracias, y facilidad y felicidad de ingenio; porque hago saber a vuestras
grandezas, si no lo tienen por enojo, que tocaba una guitarra que la hacía
hablar, y más que era poeta y gran bailarín, y sabía hacer una jaula de
pájaros, que solamente a hacerlas pudiera ganar la vida cuando se viera en
estrema necesidad, que todas estas partes y gracias son bastantes a
derribar una montaña, no que una delicada doncella. Pero toda su gentileza
y buen donaire y todas sus gracias y habilidades fueran poca o ninguna
parte para rendir la fortaleza de mi niña, si el ladrón desuellacaras no
usara del remedio de rendirme a mí primero. Primero quiso el malandrín y
desalmado vagamundo granjearme la voluntad y cohecharme el gusto, para que
yo, mal alcaide, le entregase las llaves de la fortaleza que guardaba. En
resolución: él me aduló el entendimiento y me rindió la voluntad con no sé
qué dijes y brincos que me dio, pero lo que más me hizo postrar y dar
conmigo por el suelo fueron unas coplas que le oí cantar una noche desde
una reja que caía a una callejuela donde él estaba, que, si mal no me
acuerdo, decían:
De la dulce mi enemiga
nace un mal que al alma hiere,
y, por más tormento, quiere
que se sienta y no se diga.
Parecióme la trova de perlas, y su voz de almíbar, y después acá, digo,
desde entonces, viendo el mal en que caí por estos y otros semejantes
versos, he considerado que de las buenas y concertadas repúblicas se habían
de desterrar los poetas, como aconsejaba Platón, a lo menos, los lascivos,
porque escriben unas coplas, no como las del marqués de Mantua, que
entretienen y hacen llorar los niños y a las mujeres, sino unas agudezas
que, a modo de blandas espinas, os atraviesan el alma, y como rayos os
hieren en ella, dejando sano el vestido. Y otra vez cantó:
Ven, muerte, tan escondida
que no te sienta venir,
porque el placer del morir
no me torne a dar la vida.
Y deste jaez otras coplitas y estrambotes, que cantados encantan y escritos
suspenden. Pues, ¿qué cuando se humillan a componer un género de verso que
en Candaya se usaba entonces, a quien ellos llamaban seguidillas? Allí era
el brincar de las almas, el retozar de la risa, el desasosiego de los
cuerpos y, finalmente, el azogue de todos los sentidos. Y así, digo,
señores míos, que los tales trovadores con justo título los debían
desterrar a las islas de los Lagartos. Pero no tienen ellos la culpa, sino
los simples que los alaban y las bobas que los creen; y si yo fuera la
buena dueña que debía, no me habían de mover sus trasnochados conceptos, ni
había de creer ser verdad aquel decir: "Vivo muriendo, ardo en el yelo,
tiemblo en el fuego, espero sin esperanza, pártome y quédome", con otros
imposibles desta ralea, de que están sus escritos llenos. Pues, ¿qué cuando
prometen el fénix de Arabia, la corona de Aridiana, los caballos del Sol,
del Sur las perlas, de Tíbar el oro y de Pancaya el bálsamo? Aquí es donde
ellos alargan más la pluma, como les cuesta poco prometer lo que jamás
piensan ni pueden cumplir. Pero, ¿dónde me divierto? ¡Ay de mí, desdichada!
¿Qué locura o qué desatino me lleva a contar las ajenas faltas, teniendo
tanto que decir de las mías? ¡Ay de mí, otra vez, sin ventura!, que no me
rindieron los versos, sino mi simplicidad; no me ablandaron las músicas,
sino mi liviandad: mi mucha ignorancia y mi poco advertimiento abrieron el
camino y desembarazaron la senda a los pasos de don Clavijo, que éste es el
nombre del referido caballero; y así, siendo yo la medianera, él se halló
una y muy muchas veces en la estancia de la por mí, y no por él, engañada
Antonomasia, debajo del título de verdadero esposo; que, aunque pecadora,
no consintiera que sin ser su marido la llegara a la vira de la suela de
sus zapatillas. ¡No, no, eso no: el matrimonio ha de ir adelante en
cualquier negocio destos que por mí se tratare! Solamente hubo un daño en
este negocio, que fue el de la desigualdad, por ser don Clavijo un
caballero particular, y la infanta Antonomasia heredera, como ya he dicho,
del reino. Algunos días estuvo encubierta y solapada en la sagacidad de mi
recato esta maraña, hasta que me pareció que la iba descubriendo a más
andar no sé qué hinchazón del vientre de Antonomasia, cuyo temor nos hizo
entrar en bureo a los tres, y salió dél que, antes que se saliese a luz el
mal recado, don Clavijo pidiese ante el vicario por su mujer a Antonomasia,
en fe de una cédula que de ser su esposa la infanta le había hecho, notada
por mi ingenio, con tanta fuerza, que las de Sansón no pudieran romperla.
Hiciéronse las diligencias, vio el vicario la cédula, tomó el tal vicario
la confesión a la señora, confesó de plano, mandóla depositar en casa de un
alguacil de corte muy honrado...»
A esta sazón, dijo Sancho:
— También en Candaya hay alguaciles de corte, poetas y seguidillas, por lo
que puedo jurar que imagino que todo el mundo es uno. Pero dése vuesa
merced priesa, señora Trifaldi, que es tarde y ya me muero por saber el fin
desta tan larga historia.
— Sí haré —respondió la condesa.
Capítulo XXXIX. Donde la Trifaldi prosigue su estupenda y memorable
historia
De cualquiera palabra que Sancho decía, la duquesa gustaba tanto como se
desesperaba don Quijote; y, mandándole que callase, la Dolorida prosiguió
diciendo:
— «En fin, al cabo de muchas demandas y respuestas, como la infanta se
estaba siempre en sus trece, sin salir ni variar de la primera declaración,
el vicario sentenció en favor de don Clavijo, y se la entregó por su
legítima esposa, de lo que recibió tanto enojo la reina doña Maguncia,
madre de la infanta Antonomasia, que dentro de tres días la enterramos.»
— Debió de morir, sin duda —dijo Sancho.
— ¡Claro está! —respondió Trifaldín—, que en Candaya no se entierran las
personas vivas, sino las muertas.
— Ya se ha visto, señor escudero —replicó Sancho—, enterrar un desmayado
creyendo ser muerto, y parecíame a mí que estaba la reina Maguncia obligada
a desmayarse antes que a morirse; que con la vida muchas cosas se remedian,
y no fue tan grande el disparate de la infanta que obligase a sentirle
tanto. Cuando se hubiera casado esa señora con algún paje suyo, o con otro
criado de su casa, como han hecho otras muchas, según he oído decir, fuera
el daño sin remedio; pero el haberse casado con un caballero tan
gentilhombre y tan entendido como aquí nos le han pintado, en verdad en
verdad que, aunque fue necedad, no fue tan grande como se piensa; porque,
según las reglas de mi señor, que está presente y no me dejará mentir, así
como se hacen de los hombres letrados los obispos, se pueden hacer de los
caballeros, y más si son andantes, los reyes y los emperadores.
— Razón tienes, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, porque un caballero andante, como
tenga dos dedos de ventura, está en potencia propincua de ser el mayor
señor del mundo. Pero, pase adelante la señora Dolorida, que a mí se me
trasluce que le falta por contar lo amargo desta hasta aquí dulce historia.
— Y ¡cómo si queda lo amargo! —respondió la condesa—, y tan amargo que en su
comparación son dulces las tueras y sabrosas las adelfas. «Muerta, pues, la
reina, y no desmayada, la enterramos; y, apenas la cubrimos con la tierra
y apenas le dimos el último vale, cuando,
quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis?,
puesto sobre un caballo de madera, pareció encima de la sepultura de la
reina el gigante Malambruno, primo cormano de Maguncia, que junto con ser
cruel era encantador, el cual con sus artes, en venganza de la muerte de su
cormana, y por castigo del atrevimiento de don Clavijo, y por despecho de
la demasía de Antonomasia, los dejó encantados sobre la mesma sepultura: a
ella, convertida en una jimia de bronce, y a él, en un espantoso cocodrilo
de un metal no conocido, y entre los dos está un padrón, asimismo de metal,
y en él escritas en lengua siríaca unas letras que, habiéndose declarado en
la candayesca, y ahora en la castellana, encierran esta sentencia: "No
cobrarán su primera forma estos dos atrevidos amantes hasta que el valeroso
manchego venga conmigo a las manos en singular batalla, que para solo su
gran valor guardan los hados esta nunca vista aventura". Hecho esto, sacó
de la vaina un ancho y desmesurado alfanje, y, asiéndome a mí por los
cabellos, hizo finta de querer segarme la gola y cortarme cercen la cabeza.
Turbéme, pegóseme la voz a la garganta, quedé mohína en todo estremo, pero,
con todo, me esforcé lo más que pude, y, con voz tembladora y doliente, le
dije tantas y tales cosas, que le hicieron suspender la ejecución de tan
riguroso castigo. Finalmente, hizo traer ante sí todas las dueñas de
palacio, que fueron estas que están presentes, y, después de haber
exagerado nuestra culpa y vituperado las condiciones de las dueñas, sus
malas mañas y peores trazas, y cargando a todas la culpa que yo sola tenía,
dijo que no quería con pena capital castigarnos, sino con otras penas
dilatadas, que nos diesen una muerte civil y continua; y, en aquel mismo
momento y punto que acabó de decir esto, sentimos todas que se nos abrían
los poros de la cara, y que por toda ella nos punzaban como con puntas de
agujas. Acudimos luego con las manos a los rostros, y hallámonos de la
manera que ahora veréis.»
Y luego la Dolorida y las demás dueñas alzaron los antifaces con que
cubiertas venían, y descubrieron los rostros, todos poblados de barbas,
cuáles rubias, cuáles negras, cuáles blancas y cuáles albarrazadas, de cuya
vista mostraron quedar admirados el duque y la duquesa, pasmados don
Quijote y Sancho, y atónitos todos los presentes.
Y la Trifaldi prosiguió:
— «Desta manera nos castigó aquel follón y malintencionado de Malambruno,
cubriendo la blandura y morbidez de nuestros rostros con la aspereza destas
cerdas, que pluguiera al cielo que antes con su desmesurado alfanje nos
hubiera derribado las testas, que no que nos asombrara la luz de nuestras
caras con esta borra que nos cubre; porque si entramos en cuenta, señores
míos (y esto que voy a decir agora lo quisiera decir hechos mis ojos
fuentes, pero la consideración de nuestra desgracia, y los mares que hasta
aquí han llovido, los tienen sin humor y secos como aristas, y así, lo diré
sin lágrimas), digo, pues, que ¿adónde podrá ir una dueña con barbas? ¿Qué
padre o qué madre se dolerá della? ¿Quién la dará ayuda? Pues, aun cuando
tiene la tez lisa y el rostro martirizado con mil suertes de menjurjes y
mudas, apenas halla quien bien la quiera, ¿qué hará cuando descubra hecho
un bosque su rostro? ¡Oh dueñas y compañeras mías, en desdichado punto
nacimos, en hora menguada nuestros padres nos engendraron!»
Y, diciendo esto, dio muestras de desmayarse.
Capítulo XL. De cosas que atañen y tocan a esta aventura y a esta
memorable historia
Real y verdaderamente, todos los que gustan de semejantes historias como
ésta deben de mostrarse agradecidos a Cide Hamete, su autor primero, por la
curiosidad que tuvo en contarnos las semínimas della, sin dejar cosa, por
menuda que fuese, que no la sacase a luz distintamente: pinta los
pensamientos, descubre las imaginaciones, responde a las tácitas, aclara
las dudas, resuelve los argumentos; finalmente, los átomos del más curioso
deseo manifiesta. ¡Oh autor celebérrimo! ¡Oh don Quijote dichoso! ¡Oh
Dulcinea famosa! ¡Oh Sancho Panza gracioso! Todos juntos y cada uno de por
sí viváis siglos infinitos, para gusto y general pasatiempo de los
vivientes.
Dice, pues, la historia que, así como Sancho vio desmayada a la Dolorida,
dijo:
— Por la fe de hombre de bien, juro, y por el siglo de todos mis pasados los
Panzas, que jamás he oído ni visto, ni mi amo me ha contado, ni en su
pensamiento ha cabido, semejante aventura como ésta. Válgate mil satanases,
por no maldecirte por encantador y gigante, Malambruno; y ¿no hallaste otro
género de castigo que dar a estas pecadoras sino el de barbarlas? ¿Cómo y
no fuera mejor, y a ellas les estuviera más a cuento, quitarles la mitad de
las narices de medio arriba, aunque hablaran gangoso, que no ponerles
barbas? Apostaré yo que no tienen hacienda para pagar a quien las rape.
— Así es la verdad, señor —respondió una de las doce—, que no tenemos
hacienda para mondarnos; y así, hemos tomado algunas de nosotras por
remedio ahorrativo de usar de unos pegotes o parches pegajosos, y
aplicándolos a los rostros, y tirando de golpe, quedamos rasas y lisas como
fondo de mortero de piedra; que, puesto que hay en Candaya mujeres que
andan de casa en casa a quitar el vello y a pulir las cejas y hacer otros
menjurjes tocantes a mujeres, nosotras las dueñas de mi señora por jamás
quisimos admitirlas, porque las más oliscan a terceras, habiendo dejado de
ser primas; y si por el señor don Quijote no somos remediadas, con barbas
nos llevarán a la sepultura.
— Yo me pelaría las mías —dijo don Quijote— en tierra de moros, si no
remediase las vuestras.
A este punto, volvió de su desmayo la Trifaldi y dijo:
— El retintín desa promesa, valeroso caballero, en medio de mi desmayo llegó
a mis oídos, y ha sido parte para que yo dél vuelva y cobre todos mis
sentidos; y así, de nuevo os suplico, andante ínclito y señor indomable,
vuestra graciosa promesa se convierta en obra.
— Por mí no quedará —respondió don Quijote—: ved, señora, qué es lo que
tengo de hacer, que el ánimo está muy pronto para serviros.
— Es el caso —respondió la Dolorida —que desde aquí al reino de Candaya, si
se va por tierra, hay cinco mil leguas, dos más a menos; pero si se va por
el aire y por la línea recta, hay tres mil y docientas y veinte y siete. Es
también de saber que Malambruno me dijo que cuando la suerte me deparase al
caballero nuestro libertador, que él le enviaría una cabalgadura harto
mejor y con menos malicias que las que son de retorno, porque ha de ser
aquel mesmo caballo de madera sobre quien llevó el valeroso Pierres robada
a la linda Magalona, el cual caballo se rige por una clavija que tiene en
la frente, que le sirve de freno, y vuela por el aire con tanta ligereza
que parece que los mesmos diablos le llevan. Este tal caballo, según es
tradición antigua, fue compuesto por aquel sabio Merlín; prestósele a
Pierres, que era su amigo, con el cual hizo grandes viajes, y robó, como se
ha dicho, a la linda Magalona, llevándola a las ancas por el aire, dejando
embobados a cuantos desde la tierra los miraban; y no le prestaba sino a
quien él quería, o mejor se lo pagaba; y desde el gran Pierres hasta
ahora no sabemos que haya subido alguno en él. De allí le ha sacado
Malambruno con sus artes, y le tiene en su poder, y se sirve dél en sus
viajes, que los hace por momentos, por diversas partes del mundo, y hoy
está aquí y mañana en Francia y otro día en Potosí; y es lo bueno que el
tal caballo ni come, ni duerme ni gasta herraduras, y lleva un portante por
los aires, sin tener alas, que el que lleva encima puede llevar una taza
llena de agua en la mano sin que se le derrame gota, según camina llano y
reposado; por lo cual la linda Magalona se holgaba mucho de andar caballera
en él.
A esto dijo Sancho:
— Para andar reposado y llano, mi rucio, puesto que no anda por los aires;
pero por la tierra, yo le cutiré con cuantos portantes hay en el mundo.
Riéronse todos, y la Dolorida prosiguió:
— Y este tal caballo, si es que Malambruno quiere dar fin a nuestra
desgracia, antes que sea media hora entrada la noche, estará en nuestra
presencia, porque él me significó que la señal que me daría por donde yo
entendiese que había hallado el caballero que buscaba, sería enviarme el
caballo, donde fuese con comodidad y presteza.
— Y ¿cuántos caben en ese caballo? —preguntó Sancho.
La Dolorida respondió:
— Dos personas: la una en la silla y la otra en las ancas; y, por la mayor
parte, estas tales dos personas son caballero y escudero, cuando falta
alguna robada doncella.
— Querría yo saber, señora Dolorida —dijo Sancho—, qué nombre tiene ese
caballo.
— El nombre —respondió la Dolorida— no es como el caballo de Belorofonte,
que se llamaba Pegaso, ni como el del Magno Alejandro, llamado Bucéfalo, ni
como el del furioso Orlando, cuyo nombre fue Brilladoro, ni menos Bayarte,
que fue el de Reinaldos de Montalbán, ni Frontino, como el de Rugero, ni
Bootes ni Peritoa, como dicen que se llaman los del Sol, ni tampoco se
llama Orelia, como el caballo en que el desdichado Rodrigo, último rey de
los godos, entró en la batalla donde perdió la vida y el reino.
— Yo apostaré —dijo Sancho— que, pues no le han dado ninguno desos famosos
nombres de caballos tan conocidos, que tampoco le habrán dado el de mi amo,
Rocinante, que en ser propio excede a todos los que se han nombrado.
— Así es —respondió la barbada condesa—, pero todavía le cuadra mucho,
porque se llama Clavileño el Alígero, cuyo nombre conviene con el ser de
leño, y con la clavija que trae en la frente, y con la ligereza con que
camina; y así, en cuanto al nombre, bien puede competir con el famoso
Rocinante.
— No me descontenta el nombre —replicó Sancho—, pero ¿con qué freno o con
qué jáquima se gobierna?
— Ya he dicho —respondió la Trifaldi— que con la clavija, que, volviéndola a
una parte o a otra, el caballero que va encima le hace caminar como quiere,
o ya por los aires, o ya rastreando y casi barriendo la tierra, o por el
medio, que es el que se busca y se ha de tener en todas las acciones bien
ordenadas.
— Ya lo querría ver —respondió Sancho—, pero pensar que tengo de subir en
él, ni en la silla ni en las ancas, es pedir peras al olmo. ¡Bueno es que
apenas puedo tenerme en mi rucio, y sobre un albarda más blanda que la
mesma seda, y querrían ahora que me tuviese en unas ancas de tabla, sin
cojín ni almohada alguna! Pardiez, yo no me pienso moler por quitar las
barbas a nadie: cada cual se rape como más le viniere a cuento, que yo no
pienso acompañar a mi señor en tan largo viaje. Cuanto más, que yo no debo
de hacer al caso para el rapamiento destas barbas como lo soy para el
desencanto de mi señora Dulcinea.
— Sí sois, amigo —respondió la Trifaldi—, y tanto, que, sin vuestra
presencia, entiendo que no haremos nada.
— ¡Aquí del rey! —dijo Sancho—: ¿qué tienen que ver los escuderos con las
aventuras de sus señores? ¿Hanse de llevar ellos la fama de las que acaban,
y hemos de llevar nosotros el trabajo? ¡Cuerpo de mí! Aun si dijesen los
historiadores: "El tal caballero acabó la tal y tal aventura, pero con
ayuda de fulano, su escudero, sin el cual fuera imposible el acabarla".
Pero, ¡que escriban a secas: "Don Paralipomenón de las Tres Estrellas acabó
la aventura de los seis vestiglos", sin nombrar la persona de su
escudero, que se halló presente a todo, como si no fuera en el mundo!
Ahora, señores, vuelvo a decir que mi señor se puede ir solo, y buen
provecho le haga, que yo me quedaré aquí, en compañía de la duquesa mi
señora, y podría ser que cuando volviese hallase mejorada la causa de la
señora Dulcinea en tercio y quinto; porque pienso, en los ratos ociosos y
desocupados, darme una tanda de azotes que no me la cubra pelo.
— Con todo eso, le habéis de acompañar si fuere necesario, buen Sancho,
porque os lo rogarán buenos; que no han de quedar por vuestro inútil temor
tan poblados los rostros destas señoras; que, cierto, sería mal caso.
— ¡Aquí del rey otra vez! —replicó Sancho—. Cuando esta caridad se hiciera
por algunas doncellas recogidas, o por algunas niñas de la doctrina,
pudiera el hombre aventurarse a cualquier trabajo, pero que lo sufra por
quitar las barbas a dueñas, ¡mal año! Mas que las viese yo a todas con
barbas, desde la mayor hasta la menor, y de la más melindrosa hasta la más
repulgada.
— Mal estáis con las dueñas, Sancho amigo —dijo la duquesa—: mucho os vais
tras la opinión del boticario toledano. Pues a fe que no tenéis razón; que
dueñas hay en mi casa que pueden ser ejemplo de dueñas, que aquí está mi
doña Rodríguez, que no me dejará decir otra cosa.
— Mas que la diga vuestra excelencia —dijo Rodríguez—, que Dios sabe la
verdad de todo, y buenas o malas, barbadas o lampiñas que seamos las
dueñas, también nos parió nuestra madre como a las otras mujeres; y, pues
Dios nos echó en el mundo, Él sabe para qué, y a su misericordia me atengo,
y no a las barbas de nadie.
— Ahora bien, señora Rodríguez —dijo don Quijote—, y señora Trifaldi y
compañía, yo espero en el cielo que mirará con buenos ojos vuestras cuitas,
que Sancho hará lo que yo le mandare, ya viniese Clavileño y ya me viese
con Malambruno; que yo sé que no habría navaja que con más facilidad rapase
a vuestras mercedes como mi espada raparía de los hombros la cabeza de
Malambruno; que Dios sufre a los malos, pero no para siempre.
— ¡Ay! —dijo a esta sazón la Dolorida—, con benignos ojos miren a vuestra
grandeza, valeroso caballero, todas las estrellas de las regiones celestes,
e infundan en vuestro ánimo toda prosperidad y valentía para ser escudo y
amparo del vituperoso y abatido género dueñesco, abominado de boticarios,
murmurado de escuderos y socaliñado de pajes; que mal haya la bellaca que
en la flor de su edad no se metió primero a ser monja que a dueña.
¡Desdichadas de nosotras las dueñas, que, aunque vengamos por línea recta,
de varón en varón, del mismo Héctor el troyano, no dejaran de echaros un
vos nuestras señoras, si pensasen por ello ser reinas! ¡Oh gigante
Malambruno, que, aunque eres encantador, eres certísimo en tus promesas!,
envíanos ya al sin par Clavileño, para que nuestra desdicha se acabe, que
si entra el calor y estas nuestras barbas duran, ¡guay de nuestra ventura!
Dijo esto con tanto sentimiento la Trifaldi, que sacó las lágrimas de los
ojos de todos los circunstantes, y aun arrasó los de Sancho, y propuso en
su corazón de acompañar a su señor hasta las últimas partes del mundo, si
es que en ello consistiese quitar la lana de aquellos venerables rostros.
Capítulo XLI. De la venida de Clavileño, con el fin desta dilatada aventura
Llegó en esto la noche, y con ella el punto determinado en que el famoso
caballo Clavileño viniese, cuya tardanza fatigaba ya a don Quijote,
pareciéndole que, pues Malambruno se detenía en enviarle, o que él no era
el caballero para quien estaba guardada aquella aventura, o que Malambruno
no osaba venir con él a singular batalla. Pero veis aquí cuando a deshora
entraron por el jardín cuatro salvajes, vestidos todos de verde yedra, que
sobre sus hombros traían un gran caballo de madera. Pusiéronle de pies en
el suelo, y uno de los salvajes dijo:
— Suba sobre esta máquina el que tuviere ánimo para ello.
— Aquí —dijo Sancho— yo no subo, porque ni tengo ánimo ni soy caballero.
Y el salvaje prosiguió diciendo:
— Y ocupe las ancas el escudero, si es que lo tiene, y fíese del valeroso
Malambruno, que si no fuere de su espada, de ninguna otra, ni de otra
malicia, será ofendido; y no hay más que torcer esta clavija que sobre el
cuello trae puesta, que él los llevará por los aires adonde los atiende
Malambruno; pero, porque la alteza y sublimidad del camino no les cause
váguidos, se han de cubrir los ojos hasta que el caballo relinche, que será
señal de haber dado fin a su viaje.
Esto dicho, dejando a Clavileño, con gentil continente se volvieron por
donde habían venido. La Dolorida, así como vio al caballo, casi con
lágrimas dijo a don Quijote:
— Valeroso caballero, las promesas de Malambruno han sido ciertas: el
caballo está en casa, nuestras barbas crecen, y cada una de nosotras y con
cada pelo dellas te suplicamos nos rapes y tundas, pues no está en más sino
en que subas en él con tu escudero y des felice principio a vuestro nuevo
viaje.
— Eso haré yo, señora condesa Trifaldi, de muy buen grado y de mejor
talante, sin ponerme a tomar cojín, ni calzarme espuelas, por no detenerme:
tanta es la gana que tengo de veros a vos, señora, y a todas estas dueñas
rasas y mondas.
— Eso no haré yo —dijo Sancho—, ni de malo ni de buen talante, en ninguna
manera; y si es que este rapamiento no se puede hacer sin que yo suba a las
ancas, bien puede buscar mi señor otro escudero que le acompañe, y estas
señoras otro modo de alisarse los rostros; que yo no soy brujo, para gustar
de andar por los aires. Y ¿qué dirán mis insulanos cuando sepan que su
gobernador se anda paseando por los vientos? Y otra cosa más: que habiendo
tres mil y tantas leguas de aquí a Candaya, si el caballo se cansa o el
gigante se enoja, tardaremos en dar la vuelta media docena de años, y ya ni
habrá ínsula ni ínsulos en el mundo que me conozan; y, pues se dice
comúnmente que en la tardanza va el peligro, y que cuando te dieren la
vaquilla acudas con la soguilla, perdónenme las barbas destas señoras, que
bien se está San Pedro en Roma; quiero decir que bien me estoy en esta
casa, donde tanta merced se me hace y de cuyo dueño tan gran bien espero
como es verme gobernador.
A lo que el duque dijo:
— Sancho amigo, la ínsula que yo os he prometido no es movible ni fugitiva:
raíces tiene tan hondas, echadas en los abismos de la tierra, que no la
arrancarán ni mudarán de donde está a tres tirones; y, pues vos sabéis que
sé yo que no hay ninguno género de oficio destos de mayor cantía que no se
granjee con alguna suerte de cohecho, cuál más, cuál menos, el que yo
quiero llevar por este gobierno es que vais con vuestro señor don Quijote a
dar cima y cabo a esta memorable aventura; que ahora volváis sobre
Clavileño con la brevedad que su ligereza promete, ora la contraria fortuna
os traiga y vuelva a pie, hecho romero, de mesón en mesón y de venta en
venta, siempre que volviéredes hallaréis vuestra ínsula donde la dejáis, y
a vuestros insulanos con el mesmo deseo de recebiros por su gobernador que
siempre han tenido, y mi voluntad será la mesma; y no pongáis duda en esta
verdad, señor Sancho, que sería hacer notorio agravio al deseo que de
serviros tengo.
— No más, señor —dijo Sancho—: yo soy un pobre escudero y no puedo llevar a
cuestas tantas cortesías; suba mi amo, tápenme estos ojos y encomiéndenme a
Dios, y avísenme si cuando vamos por esas altanerías podré encomendarme a
Nuestro Señor o invocar los ángeles que me favorezcan.
A lo que respondió Trifaldi:
— Sancho, bien podéis encomendaros a Dios o a quien quisiéredes, que
Malambruno, aunque es encantador, es cristiano, y hace sus encantamentos
con mucha sagacidad y con mucho tiento, sin meterse con nadie.
— ¡Ea, pues —dijo Sancho—, Dios me ayude y la Santísima Trinidad de Gaeta!
— Desde la memorable aventura de los batanes —dijo don Quijote—, nunca he
visto a Sancho con tanto temor como ahora, y si yo fuera tan agorero como
otros, su pusilanimidad me hiciera algunas cosquillas en el ánimo. Pero
llegaos aquí, Sancho, que con licencia destos señores os quiero hablar
aparte dos palabras.
Y, apartando a Sancho entre unos árboles del jardín y asiéndole ambas las
manos, le dijo:
— Ya vees, Sancho hermano, el largo viaje que nos espera, y que sabe Dios
cuándo volveremos dél, ni la comodidad y espacio que nos darán los
negocios; así, querría que ahora te retirases en tu aposento, como que vas
a buscar alguna cosa necesaria para el camino, y, en un daca las pajas,
te dieses, a buena cuenta de los tres mil y trecientos azotes a que estás
obligado, siquiera quinientos, que dados te los tendrás, que el comenzar
las cosas es tenerlas medio acabadas.
— ¡Par Dios —dijo Sancho—, que vuestra merced debe de ser menguado! Esto es
como aquello que dicen: "¡en priesa me vees y doncellez me demandas!"
¿Ahora que tengo de ir sentado en una tabla rasa, quiere vuestra merced que
me lastime las posas? En verdad en verdad que no tiene vuestra merced
razón. Vamos ahora a rapar estas dueñas, que a la vuelta yo le prometo a
vuestra merced, como quien soy, de darme tanta priesa a salir de mi
obligación, que vuestra merced se contente, y no le digo más.
Y don Quijote respondió:
— Pues con esa promesa, buen Sancho, voy consolado, y creo que la cumplirás,
porque, en efecto, aunque tonto, eres hombre verídico.
— No soy verde, sino moreno —dijo Sancho—, pero aunque fuera de mezcla,
cumpliera mi palabra.
Y con esto se volvieron a subir en Clavileño, y al subir dijo don Quijote:
— Tapaos, Sancho, y subid, Sancho, que quien de tan lueñes tierras envía por
nosotros no será para engañarnos, por la poca gloria que le puede redundar
de engañar a quien dél se fía; y, puesto que todo sucediese al revés de lo
que imagino, la gloria de haber emprendido esta hazaña no la podrá
escurecer malicia alguna.
— Vamos, señor —dijo Sancho—, que las barbas y lágrimas destas señoras las
tengo clavadas en el corazón, y no comeré bocado que bien me sepa hasta
verlas en su primera lisura. Suba vuesa merced y tápese primero, que si yo
tengo de ir a las ancas, claro está que primero sube el de la silla.
— Así es la verdad —replicó don Quijote.
Y, sacando un pañuelo de la faldriquera, pidió a la Dolorida que le
cubriese muy bien los ojos, y, habiéndoselos cubierto, se volvió a
descubrir y dijo:
— Si mal no me acuerdo, yo he leído en Virgilio aquello del Paladión de
Troya, que fue un caballo de madera que los griegos presentaron a la diosa
Palas, el cual iba preñado de caballeros armados, que después fueron la
total ruina de Troya; y así, será bien ver primero lo que Clavileño trae en
su estómago.
— No hay para qué —dijo la Dolorida—, que yo le fío y sé que Malambruno no
tiene nada de malicioso ni de traidor; vuesa merced, señor don Quijote,
suba sin pavor alguno, y a mi daño si alguno le sucediere.
Parecióle a don Quijote que cualquiera cosa que replicase acerca de su
seguridad sería poner en detrimento su valentía; y así, sin más altercar,
subió sobre Clavileño y le tentó la clavija, que fácilmente se rodeaba; y,
como no tenía estribos y le colgaban las piernas, no parecía sino figura de
tapiz flamenco pintada o tejida en algún romano triunfo. De mal talante y
poco a poco llegó a subir Sancho, y, acomodándose lo mejor que pudo en las
ancas, las halló algo duras y no nada blandas, y pidió al duque que, si
fuese posible, le acomodasen de algún cojín o de alguna almohada, aunque
fuese del estrado de su señora la duquesa, o del lecho de algún paje,
porque las ancas de aquel caballo más parecían de mármol que de leño.
A esto dijo la Trifaldi que ningún jaez ni ningún género de adorno sufría
sobre sí Clavileño; que lo que podía hacer era ponerse a mujeriegas, y que
así no sentiría tanto la dureza. Hízolo así Sancho, y, diciendo ''a Dios'',
se dejó vendar los ojos, y, ya después de vendados, se volvió a descubrir,
y, mirando a todos los del jardín tiernamente y con lágrimas, dijo que le
ayudasen en aquel trance con sendos paternostres y sendas avemarías, porque
Dios deparase quien por ellos los dijese cuando en semejantes trances se
viesen. A lo que dijo don Quijote:
— Ladrón, ¿estás puesto en la horca por ventura, o en el último término de
la vida, para usar de semejantes plegarias? ¿No estás, desalmada y cobarde
criatura, en el mismo lugar que ocupó la linda Magalona, del cual decendió,
no a la sepultura, sino a ser reina de Francia, si no mienten las
historias? Y yo, que voy a tu lado, ¿no puedo ponerme al del valeroso
Pierres, que oprimió este mismo lugar que yo ahora oprimo? Cúbrete,
cúbrete, animal descorazonado, y no te salga a la boca el temor que tienes,
a lo menos en presencia mía.
— Tápenme —respondió Sancho—; y, pues no quieren que me encomiende a Dios ni
que sea encomendado, ¿qué mucho que tema no ande por aquí alguna región de
diablos que den con nosotros en Peralvillo?
Cubriéronse, y, sintiendo don Quijote que estaba como había de estar, tentó
la clavija, y, apenas hubo puesto los dedos en ella, cuando todas las
dueñas y cuantos estaban presentes levantaron las voces, diciendo:
— ¡Dios te guíe, valeroso caballero!
— ¡Dios sea contigo, escudero intrépido!
— ¡Ya, ya vais por esos aires, rompiéndolos con más velocidad que una saeta!
— ¡Ya comenzáis a suspender y admirar a cuantos desde la tierra os están
mirando!
— ¡Tente, valeroso Sancho, que te bamboleas! ¡Mira no cayas, que será peor
tu caída que la del atrevido mozo que quiso regir el carro del Sol, su
padre!
Oyó Sancho las voces, y, apretándose con su amo y ciñiéndole con los
brazos, le dijo:
— Señor, ¿cómo dicen éstos que vamos tan altos, si alcanzan acá sus voces, y
no parecen sino que están aquí hablando junto a nosotros?
— No repares en eso, Sancho, que, como estas cosas y estas volaterías van
fuera de los cursos ordinarios, de mil leguas verás y oirás lo que
quisieres. Y no me aprietes tanto, que me derribas; y en verdad que no sé
de qué te turbas ni te espantas, que osaré jurar que en todos los días de
mi vida he subido en cabalgadura de paso más llano: no parece sino que no
nos movemos de un lugar. Destierra, amigo, el miedo, que, en efecto, la
cosa va como ha de ir y el viento llevamos en popa.
— Así es la verdad —respondió Sancho—, que por este lado me da un viento tan
recio, que parece que con mil fuelles me están soplando.
Y así era ello, que unos grandes fuelles le estaban haciendo aire: tan bien
trazada estaba la tal aventura por el duque y la duquesa y su mayordomo,
que no le faltó requisito que la dejase de hacer perfecta.
Sintiéndose, pues, soplar don Quijote, dijo:
— Sin duda alguna, Sancho, que ya debemos de llegar a la segunda región del
aire, adonde se engendra el granizo, las nieves; los truenos, los
relámpagos y los rayos se engendran en la tercera región, y si es que desta
manera vamos subiendo, presto daremos en la región del fuego, y no sé yo
cómo templar esta clavija para que no subamos donde nos abrasemos.
En esto, con unas estopas ligeras de encenderse y apagarse, desde lejos,
pendientes de una caña, les calentaban los rostros. Sancho, que sintió el
calor, dijo:
— Que me maten si no estamos ya en el lugar del fuego, o bien cerca, porque
una gran parte de mi barba se me ha chamuscado, y estoy, señor, por
descubrirme y ver en qué parte estamos.
— No hagas tal —respondió don Quijote—, y acuérdate del verdadero cuento del
licenciado Torralba, a quien llevaron los diablos en volandas por el aire,
caballero en una caña, cerrados los ojos, y en doce horas llegó a Roma, y
se apeó en Torre de Nona, que es una calle de la ciudad, y vio todo el
fracaso y asalto y muerte de Borbón, y por la mañana ya estaba de vuelta en
Madrid, donde dio cuenta de todo lo que había visto; el cual asimismo dijo
que cuando iba por el aire le mandó el diablo que abriese los ojos, y los
abrió, y se vio tan cerca, a su parecer, del cuerpo de la luna, que la
pudiera asir con la mano, y que no osó mirar a la tierra por no
desvanecerse. Así que, Sancho, no hay para qué descubrirnos; que, el que
nos lleva a cargo, él dará cuenta de nosotros, y quizá vamos tomando puntas
y subiendo en alto para dejarnos caer de una sobre el reino de Candaya,
como hace el sacre o neblí sobre la garza para cogerla, por más que se
remonte; y, aunque nos parece que no ha media hora que nos partimos del
jardín, creéme que debemos de haber hecho gran camino.
— No sé lo que es —respondió Sancho Panza—, sólo sé decir que si la señora
Magallanes o Magalona se contentó destas ancas, que no debía de ser muy
tierna de carnes.
Todas estas pláticas de los dos valientes oían el duque y la duquesa y los
del jardín, de que recibían estraordinario contento; y, queriendo dar
remate a la estraña y bien fabricada aventura, por la cola de Clavileño le
pegaron fuego con unas estopas, y al punto, por estar el caballo lleno de
cohetes tronadores, voló por los aires, con estraño ruido, y dio con don
Quijote y con Sancho Panza en el suelo, medio chamuscados.
En este tiempo ya se habían desparecido del jardín todo el barbado
escuadrón de las dueñas y la Trifaldi y todo, y los del jardín quedaron
como desmayados, tendidos por el suelo. Don Quijote y Sancho se levantaron
maltrechos, y, mirando a todas partes, quedaron atónitos de verse en el
mesmo jardín de donde habían partido y de ver tendido por tierra tanto
número de gente; y creció más su admiración cuando a un lado del jardín
vieron hincada una gran lanza en el suelo y pendiente della y de dos
cordones de seda verde un pergamino liso y blanco, en el cual, con grandes
letras de oro, estaba escrito lo siguiente:
El ínclito caballero don Quijote de la Mancha feneció y acabó la aventura
de la condesa Trifaldi, por otro nombre llamada la dueña Dolorida, y
compañía, con sólo intentarla.
Malambruno se da por contento y satisfecho a toda su voluntad, y las barbas
de las dueñas ya quedan lisas y mondas, y los reyes don Clavijo y
Antonomasia en su prístino estado. Y, cuando se cumpliere el escuderil
vápulo, la blanca paloma se verá libre de los pestíferos girifaltes que la
persiguen, y en brazos de su querido arrullador; que así está ordenado por
el sabio Merlín, protoencantador de los encantadores.
Habiendo, pues, don Quijote leído las letras del pergamino, claro entendió
que del desencanto de Dulcinea hablaban; y, dando muchas gracias al cielo
de que con tan poco peligro hubiese acabado tan gran fecho, reduciendo a su
pasada tez los rostros de las venerables dueñas, que ya no parecían, se fue
adonde el duque y la duquesa aún no habían vuelto en sí, y, trabando de la
mano al duque, le dijo:
— ¡Ea, buen señor, buen ánimo; buen ánimo, que todo es nada! La aventura es
ya acabada sin daño de barras, como lo muestra claro el escrito que en
aquel padrón está puesto.
El duque, poco a poco, y como quien de un pesado sueño recuerda, fue
volviendo en sí, y por el mismo tenor la duquesa y todos los que por el
jardín estaban caídos, con tales muestras de maravilla y espanto, que casi
se podían dar a entender haberles acontecido de veras lo que tan bien
sabían fingir de burlas. Leyó el duque el cartel con los ojos medio
cerrados, y luego, con los brazos abiertos, fue a abrazar a don Quijote,
diciéndole ser el más buen caballero que en ningún siglo se hubiese visto.
Sancho andaba mirando por la Dolorida, por ver qué rostro tenía sin las
barbas, y si era tan hermosa sin ellas como su gallarda disposición
prometía, pero dijéronle que, así como Clavileño bajó ardiendo por los
aires y dio en el suelo, todo el escuadrón de las dueñas, con la Trifaldi,
había desaparecido, y que ya iban rapadas y sin cañones. Preguntó la
duquesa a Sancho que cómo le había ido en aquel largo viaje. A lo cual
Sancho respondió:
— Yo, señora, sentí que íbamos, según mi señor me dijo, volando por la
región del fuego, y quise descubrirme un poco los ojos, pero mi amo, a
quien pedí licencia para descubrirme, no la consintió; mas yo, que tengo no
sé qué briznas de curioso y de desear saber lo que se me estorba y impide,
bonitamente y sin que nadie lo viese, por junto a las narices aparté tanto
cuanto el pañizuelo que me tapaba los ojos, y por allí miré hacia la
tierra, y parecióme que toda ella no era mayor que un grano de mostaza, y
los hombres que andaban sobre ella, poco mayores que avellanas; porque se
vea cuán altos debíamos de ir entonces.
A esto dijo la duquesa:
— Sancho amigo, mirad lo que decís, que, a lo que parece, vos no vistes la
tierra, sino los hombres que andaban sobre ella; y está claro que si la
tierra os pareció como un grano de mostaza, y cada hombre como una
avellana, un hombre solo había de cubrir toda la tierra.
— Así es verdad —respondió Sancho—, pero, con todo eso, la descubrí por un
ladito, y la vi toda.
— Mirad, Sancho —dijo la duquesa—, que por un ladito no se vee el todo de lo
que se mira.
— Yo no sé esas miradas —replicó Sancho—: sólo sé que será bien que vuestra
señoría entienda que, pues volábamos por encantamento, por encantamento
podía yo ver toda la tierra y todos los hombres por doquiera que los
mirara; y si esto no se me cree, tampoco creerá vuestra merced cómo,
descubriéndome por junto a las cejas, me vi tan junto al cielo que no había
de mí a él palmo y medio, y por lo que puedo jurar, señora mía, que es muy
grande además. Y sucedió que íbamos por parte donde están las siete
cabrillas; y en Dios y en mi ánima que, como yo en mi niñez fui en mi
tierra cabrerizo, que así como las vi, ¡me dio una gana de entretenerme con
ellas un rato...! Y si no le cumpliera me parece que reventara. Vengo,
pues, y tomo, y ¿qué hago? Sin decir nada a nadie, ni a mi señor tampoco,
bonita y pasitamente me apeé de Clavileño, y me entretuve con las
cabrillas, que son como unos alhelíes y como unas flores, casi tres cuartos
de hora, y Clavileño no se movió de un lugar, ni pasó adelante.
— Y, en tanto que el buen Sancho se entretenía con las cabras —preguntó el
duque—, ¿en qué se entretenía el señor don Quijote?
A lo que don Quijote respondió:
— Como todas estas cosas y estos tales sucesos van fuera del orden natural,
no es mucho que Sancho diga lo que dice. De mí sé decir que ni me descubrí
por alto ni por bajo, ni vi el cielo ni la tierra, ni la mar ni las arenas.
Bien es verdad que sentí que pasaba por la región del aire, y aun que
tocaba a la del fuego; pero que pasásemos de allí no lo puedo creer, pues,
estando la región del fuego entre el cielo de la luna y la última región
del aire, no podíamos llegar al cielo donde están las siete cabrillas que
Sancho dice, sin abrasarnos; y, pues no nos asuramos, o Sancho miente o
Sancho sueña.
— Ni miento ni sueño —respondió Sancho—: si no, pregúntenme las señas de las
tales cabras, y por ellas verán si digo verdad o no.
— Dígalas, pues, Sancho —dijo la duquesa.
— Son —respondió Sancho— las dos verdes, las dos encarnadas, las dos azules,
y la una de mezcla.
— Nueva manera de cabras es ésa —dijo el duque—, y por esta nuestra región
del suelo no se usan tales colores; digo, cabras de tales colores.
— Bien claro está eso —dijo Sancho—; sí, que diferencia ha de haber de las
cabras del cielo a las del suelo.
— Decidme, Sancho —preguntó el duque—: ¿vistes allá en entre esas cabras
algún cabrón?
— No, señor —respondió Sancho—, pero oí decir que ninguno pasaba de los
cuernos de la luna.
No quisieron preguntarle más de su viaje, porque les pareció que llevaba
Sancho hilo de pasearse por todos los cielos, y dar nuevas de cuanto allá
pasaba, sin haberse movido del jardín.
En resolución, éste fue el fin de la aventura de la dueña Dolorida, que dio
que reír a los duques, no sólo aquel tiempo, sino el de toda su vida, y que
contar a Sancho siglos, si los viviera; y, llegándose don Quijote a Sancho,
al oído le dijo:
— Sancho, pues vos queréis que se os crea lo que habéis visto en el cielo,
yo quiero que vos me creáis a mí lo que vi en la cueva de Montesinos; y no
os digo más.
Capítulo XLII. De los consejos que dio don Quijote a Sancho Panza antes que
fuese a gobernar la ínsula, con otras cosas bien consideradas
Con el felice y gracioso suceso de la aventura de la Dolorida, quedaron tan
contentos los duques, que determinaron pasar con las burlas adelante,
viendo el acomodado sujeto que tenían para que se tuviesen por veras; y
así, habiendo dado la traza y órdenes que sus criados y sus vasallos habían
de guardar con Sancho en el gobierno de la ínsula prometida, otro día, que
fue el que sucedió al vuelo de Clavileño, dijo el duque a Sancho que se
adeliñase y compusiese para ir a ser gobernador, que ya sus insulanos le
estaban esperando como el agua de mayo. Sancho se le humilló y le dijo:
— Después que bajé del cielo, y después que desde su alta cumbre miré la
tierra y la vi tan pequeña, se templó en parte en mí la gana que tenía tan
grande de ser gobernador; porque, ¿qué grandeza es mandar en un grano de
mostaza, o qué dignidad o imperio el gobernar a media docena de hombres
tamaños como avellanas, que, a mi parecer, no había más en toda la tierra?
Si vuestra señoría fuese servido de darme una tantica parte del cielo,
aunque no fuese más de media legua, la tomaría de mejor gana que la mayor
ínsula del mundo.
— Mirad, amigo Sancho —respondió el duque—: yo no puedo dar parte del cielo
a nadie, aunque no sea mayor que una uña, que a solo Dios están reservadas
esas mercedes y gracias. Lo que puedo dar os doy, que es una ínsula hecha y
derecha, redonda y bien proporcionada, y sobremanera fértil y abundosa,
donde si vos os sabéis dar maña, podéis con las riquezas de la tierra
granjear las del cielo.
— Ahora bien —respondió Sancho—, venga esa ínsula, que yo pugnaré por ser
tal gobernador que, a pesar de bellacos, me vaya al cielo; y esto no es por
codicia que yo tenga de salir de mis casillas ni de levantarme a mayores,
sino por el deseo que tengo de probar a qué sabe el ser gobernador.
— Si una vez lo probáis, Sancho —dijo el duque—, comeros heis las manos tras
el gobierno, por ser dulcísima cosa el mandar y ser obedecido. A buen
seguro que cuando vuestro dueño llegue a ser emperador, que lo será sin
duda, según van encaminadas sus cosas, que no se lo arranquen comoquiera, y
que le duela y le pese en la mitad del alma del tiempo que hubiere dejado
de serlo.
— Señor —replicó Sancho—, yo imagino que es bueno mandar, aunque sea a un
hato de ganado.
— Con vos me entierren, Sancho, que sabéis de todo —respondió el duque—, y
yo espero que seréis tal gobernador como vuestro juicio promete, y quédese
esto aquí y advertid que mañana en ese mesmo día habéis de ir al gobierno
de la ínsula, y esta tarde os acomodarán del traje conveniente que habéis
de llevar y de todas las cosas necesarias a vuestra partida.
— Vístanme —dijo Sancho— como quisieren, que de cualquier manera que vaya
vestido seré Sancho Panza.
— Así es verdad —dijo el duque—, pero los trajes se han de acomodar con el
oficio o dignidad que se profesa, que no sería bien que un jurisperito se
vistiese como soldado, ni un soldado como un sacerdote. Vos, Sancho, iréis
vestido parte de letrado y parte de capitán, porque en la ínsula que os doy
tanto son menester las armas como las letras, y las letras como las armas.
— Letras —respondió Sancho—, pocas tengo, porque aún no sé el A, B, C; pero
bástame tener el Christus en la memoria para ser buen gobernador. De las
armas manejaré las que me dieren, hasta caer, y Dios delante.
— Con tan buena memoria —dijo el duque—, no podrá Sancho errar en nada.
En esto llegó don Quijote, y, sabiendo lo que pasaba y la celeridad con que
Sancho se había de partir a su gobierno, con licencia del duque le tomó por
la mano y se fue con él a su estancia, con intención de aconsejarle cómo se
había de haber en su oficio.
Entrados, pues, en su aposento, cerró tras sí la puerta, y hizo casi por
fuerza que Sancho se sentase junto a él, y con reposada voz le dijo:
— Infinitas gracias doy al cielo, Sancho amigo, de que, antes y primero que
yo haya encontrado con alguna buena dicha, te haya salido a ti a recebir y
a encontrar la buena ventura. Yo, que en mi buena suerte te tenía librada
la paga de tus servicios, me veo en los principios de aventajarme, y tú,
antes de tiempo, contra la ley del razonable discurso, te vees premiado de
tus deseos. Otros cohechan, importunan, solicitan, madrugan, ruegan,
porfían, y no alcanzan lo que pretenden; y llega otro, y sin saber cómo ni
cómo no, se halla con el cargo y oficio que otros muchos pretendieron; y
aquí entra y encaja bien el decir que hay buena y mala fortuna en las
pretensiones. Tú, que para mí, sin duda alguna, eres un porro, sin madrugar
ni trasnochar y sin hacer diligencia alguna, con solo el aliento que te ha
tocado de la andante caballería, sin más ni más te vees gobernador de una
ínsula, como quien no dice nada. Todo esto digo, ¡oh Sancho!, para que no
atribuyas a tus merecimientos la merced recebida, sino que des gracias al
cielo, que dispone suavemente las cosas, y después las darás a la grandeza
que en sí encierra la profesión de la caballería andante. Dispuesto, pues,
el corazón a creer lo que te he dicho, está, ¡oh hijo!, atento a este tu
Catón, que quiere aconsejarte y ser norte y guía que te encamine y saque a
seguro puerto deste mar proceloso donde vas a engolfarte; que los oficios y
grandes cargos no son otra cosa sino un golfo profundo de confusiones.
Primeramente, ¡oh hijo!, has de temer a Dios, porque en el temerle está la
sabiduría, y siendo sabio no podrás errar en nada. Lo segundo, has de poner
los ojos en quien eres, procurando conocerte a ti mismo, que es el más
difícil conocimiento que puede imaginarse. Del conocerte saldrá el no
hincharte como la rana que quiso igualarse con el buey, que si esto haces,
vendrá a ser feos pies de la rueda de tu locura la consideración de haber
guardado puercos en tu tierra.
— Así es la verdad —respondió Sancho—, pero fue cuando muchacho; pero
después, algo hombrecillo, gansos fueron los que guardé, que no puercos;
pero esto paréceme a mí que no hace al caso, que no todos los que gobiernan
vienen de casta de reyes.
— Así es verdad —replicó don Quijote—, por lo cual los no de principios
nobles deben acompañar la gravedad del cargo que ejercitan con una blanda
suavidad que, guiada por la prudencia, los libre de la murmuración
maliciosa, de quien no hay estado que se escape. Haz gala, Sancho, de la
humildad de tu linaje, y no te desprecies de decir que vienes de
labradores; porque, viendo que no te corres, ninguno se pondrá a correrte;
y préciate más de ser humilde virtuoso que pecador soberbio. Inumerables
son aquellos que, de baja estirpe nacidos, han subido a la suma dignidad
pontificia e imperatoria; y desta verdad te pudiera traer tantos ejemplos,
que te cansaran. Mira, Sancho: si tomas por medio a la virtud, y te precias
de hacer hechos virtuosos, no hay para qué tener envidia a los que los
tienen de príncipes y señores, porque la sangre se hereda y la virtud se
aquista, y la virtud vale por sí sola lo que la sangre no vale. Siendo esto
así, como lo es, que si acaso viniere a verte cuando estés en tu ínsula
alguno de tus parientes, no le deseches ni le afrentes; antes le has de
acoger, agasajar y regalar, que con esto satisfarás al cielo, que gusta que
nadie se desprecie de lo que él hizo, y corresponderás a lo que debes a la
naturaleza bien concertada. Si trujeres a tu mujer contigo (porque no es
bien que los que asisten a gobiernos de mucho tiempo estén sin las
propias), enséñala, doctrínala y desbástala de su natural rudeza, porque
todo lo que suele adquirir un gobernador discreto suele perder y derramar
una mujer rústica y tonta. Si acaso enviudares, cosa que puede suceder, y
con el cargo mejorares de consorte, no la tomes tal, que te sirva de
anzuelo y de caña de pescar, y del no quiero de tu capilla, porque en
verdad te digo que de todo aquello que la mujer del juez recibiere ha de
dar cuenta el marido en la residencia universal, donde pagará con el cuatro
tanto en la muerte las partidas de que no se hubiere hecho cargo en la
vida. Nunca te guíes por la ley del encaje, que suele tener mucha cabida
con los ignorantes que presumen de agudos. Hallen en ti más compasión las
lágrimas del pobre, pero no más justicia, que las informaciones del rico.
Procura descubrir la verdad por entre las promesas y dádivas del rico, como
por entre los sollozos e importunidades del pobre. Cuando pudiere y debiere
tener lugar la equidad, no cargues todo el rigor de la ley al delincuente,
que no es mejor la fama del juez riguroso que la del compasivo. Si acaso
doblares la vara de la justicia, no sea con el peso de la dádiva, sino con
el de la misericordia. Cuando te sucediere juzgar algún pleito de algún tu
enemigo, aparta las mientes de tu injuria y ponlas en la verdad del caso.
No te ciegue la pasión propia en la causa ajena, que los yerros que en ella
hicieres, las más veces, serán sin remedio; y si le tuvieren, será a costa
de tu crédito, y aun de tu hacienda. Si alguna mujer hermosa veniere a
pedirte justicia, quita los ojos de sus lágrimas y tus oídos de sus
gemidos, y considera de espacio la sustancia de lo que pide, si no quieres
que se anegue tu razón en su llanto y tu bondad en sus suspiros. Al que has
de castigar con obras no trates mal con palabras, pues le basta al
desdichado la pena del suplicio, sin la añadidura de las malas razones. Al
culpado que cayere debajo de tu juridición considérale hombre miserable,
sujeto a las condiciones de la depravada naturaleza nuestra, y en todo
cuanto fuere de tu parte, sin hacer agravio a la contraria, muéstratele
piadoso y clemente, porque, aunque los atributos de Dios todos son iguales,
más resplandece y campea a nuestro ver el de la misericordia que el de la
justicia. Si estos preceptos y estas reglas sigues, Sancho, serán luengos
tus días, tu fama será eterna, tus premios colmados, tu felicidad
indecible, casarás tus hijos como quisieres, títulos tendrán ellos y tus
nietos, vivirás en paz y beneplácito de las gentes, y en los últimos pasos
de la vida te alcanzará el de la muerte, en vejez suave y madura, y
cerrarán tus ojos las tiernas y delicadas manos de tus terceros netezuelos.
Esto que hasta aquí te he dicho son documentos que han de adornar tu alma;
escucha ahora los que han de servir para adorno del cuerpo.
Capítulo XLIII. De los consejos segundos que dio don Quijote a Sancho Panza
¿Quién oyera el pasado razonamiento de don Quijote que no le tuviera por
persona muy cuerda y mejor intencionada? Pero, como muchas veces en el
progreso desta grande historia queda dicho, solamente disparaba en
tocándole en la caballería, y en los demás discursos mostraba tener claro y
desenfadado entendimiento, de manera que a cada paso desacreditaban sus
obras su juicio, y su juicio sus obras; pero en ésta destos segundos
documentos que dio a Sancho, mostró tener gran donaire, y puso su
discreción y su locura en un levantado punto.
Atentísimamente le escuchaba Sancho, y procuraba conservar en la memoria
sus consejos, como quien pensaba guardarlos y salir por ellos a buen parto
de la preñez de su gobierno. Prosiguió, pues, don Quijote, y dijo:
— En lo que toca a cómo has de gobernar tu persona y casa, Sancho, lo
primero que te encargo es que seas limpio, y que te cortes las uñas, sin
dejarlas crecer, como algunos hacen, a quien su ignorancia les ha dado a
entender que las uñas largas les hermosean las manos, como si aquel
escremento y añadidura que se dejan de cortar fuese uña, siendo antes
garras de cernícalo lagartijero: puerco y extraordinario abuso. No andes,
Sancho, desceñido y flojo, que el vestido descompuesto da indicios de ánimo
desmazalado, si ya la descompostura y flojedad no cae debajo de
socarronería, como se juzgó en la de Julio César. Toma con discreción el
pulso a lo que pudiere valer tu oficio, y si sufriere que des librea a tus
criados, dásela honesta y provechosa más que vistosa y bizarra, y repártela
entre tus criados y los pobres: quiero decir que si has de vestir seis
pajes, viste tres y otros tres pobres, y así tendrás pajes para el cielo y
para el suelo; y este nuevo modo de dar librea no la alcanzan los
vanagloriosos. No comas ajos ni cebollas, porque no saquen por el olor tu
villanería. Anda despacio; habla con reposo, pero no de manera que parezca
que te escuchas a ti mismo, que toda afectación es mala. Come poco y cena
más poco, que la salud de todo el cuerpo se fragua en la oficina del
estómago. Sé templado en el beber, considerando que el vino demasiado ni
guarda secreto ni cumple palabra. Ten cuenta, Sancho, de no mascar a dos
carrillos, ni de erutar delante de nadie.
— Eso de erutar no entiendo —dijo Sancho.
Y don Quijote le dijo:
— Erutar, Sancho, quiere decir regoldar, y éste es uno de los más torpes
vocablos que tiene la lengua castellana, aunque es muy sinificativo; y así,
la gente curiosa se ha acogido al latín, y al regoldar dice erutar, y a los
regüeldos, erutaciones; y, cuando algunos no entienden estos términos,
importa poco, que el uso los irá introduciendo con el tiempo, que con
facilidad se entiendan; y esto es enriquecer la lengua, sobre quien tiene
poder el vulgo y el uso.
— En verdad, señor —dijo Sancho—, que uno de los consejos y avisos que
pienso llevar en la memoria ha de ser el de no regoldar, porque lo suelo
hacer muy a menudo.
— Erutar, Sancho, que no regoldar —dijo don Quijote.
— Erutar diré de aquí adelante —respondió Sancho—, y a fee que no se me
olvide.
— También, Sancho, no has de mezclar en tus pláticas la muchedumbre de
refranes que sueles; que, puesto que los refranes son sentencias breves,
muchas veces los traes tan por los cabellos, que más parecen disparates que
sentencias.
— Eso Dios lo puede remediar —respondió Sancho—, porque sé más refranes que
un libro, y viénenseme tantos juntos a la boca cuando hablo, que riñen por
salir unos con otros, pero la lengua va arrojando los primeros que
encuentra, aunque no vengan a pelo. Mas yo tendré cuenta de aquí adelante
de decir los que convengan a la gravedad de mi cargo, que en casa llena
presto se guisa la cena, y quien destaja no baraja, y a buen salvo está el
que repica, y el dar y el tener seso ha menester.
— ¡Eso sí, Sancho! —dijo don Quijote—: ¡encaja, ensarta, enhila refranes,
que nadie te va a la mano! ¡Castígame mi madre, y yo trómpogelas! Estoyte
diciendo que escuses refranes, y en un instante has echado aquí una letanía
dellos, que así cuadran con lo que vamos tratando como por los cerros de
Úbeda. Mira, Sancho, no te digo yo que parece mal un refrán traído a
propósito, pero cargar y ensartar refranes a troche moche hace la plática
desmayada y baja. Cuando subieres a caballo, no vayas echando el cuerpo
sobre el arzón postrero, ni lleves las piernas tiesas y tiradas y desviadas
de la barriga del caballo, ni tampoco vayas tan flojo que parezca que vas
sobre el rucio: que el andar a caballo a unos hace caballeros; a otros,
caballerizos. Sea moderado tu sueño, que el que no madruga con el sol, no
goza del día; y advierte, ¡oh Sancho!, que la diligencia es madre de la
buena ventura, y la pereza, su contraria, jamás llegó al término que pide
un buen deseo. Este último consejo que ahora darte quiero, puesto que no
sirva para adorno del cuerpo, quiero que le lleves muy en la memoria, que
creo que no te será de menos provecho que los que hasta aquí te he dado; y
es que jamás te pongas a disputar de linajes, a lo menos, comparándolos
entre sí, pues, por fuerza, en los que se comparan uno ha de ser el mejor,
y del que abatieres serás aborrecido, y del que levantares en ninguna
manera premiado. Tu vestido será calza entera, ropilla larga, herreruelo un
poco más largo; greguescos, ni por pienso, que no les están bien ni a los
caballeros ni a los gobernadores. Por ahora, esto se me ha ofrecido,
Sancho, que aconsejarte; andará el tiempo, y, según las ocasiones, así
serán mis documentos, como tú tengas cuidado de avisarme el estado en que
te hallares.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, bien veo que todo cuanto vuestra merced me ha
dicho son cosas buenas, santas y provechosas, pero ¿de qué han de servir,
si de ninguna me acuerdo? Verdad sea que aquello de no dejarme crecer las
uñas y de casarme otra vez, si se ofreciere, no se me pasará del magín,
pero esotros badulaques y enredos y revoltillos, no se me acuerda ni
acordará más dellos que de las nubes de antaño, y así, será menester que se
me den por escrito, que, puesto que no sé leer ni escribir, yo se los daré
a mi confesor para que me los encaje y recapacite cuando fuere menester.
— ¡Ah, pecador de mí —respondió don Quijote—, y qué mal parece en los
gobernadores el no saber leer ni escribir!; porque has de saber, ¡oh
Sancho!, que no saber un hombre leer, o ser zurdo, arguye una de dos cosas:
o que fue hijo de padres demasiado de humildes y bajos, o él tan travieso
y malo que no pudo entrar en el buen uso ni la buena doctrina. Gran falta
es la que llevas contigo, y así, querría que aprendieses a firmar siquiera.
— Bien sé firmar mi nombre —respondió Sancho—, que cuando fui prioste en mi
lugar, aprendí a hacer unas letras como de marca de fardo, que decían que
decía mi nombre; cuanto más, que fingiré que tengo tullida la mano derecha,
y haré que firme otro por mí; que para todo hay remedio, si no es para la
muerte; y, teniendo yo el mando y el palo, haré lo que quisiere; cuanto
más, que el que tiene el padre alcalde... Y, siendo yo gobernador, que es
más que ser alcalde, ¡llegaos, que la dejan ver! No, sino popen y
calóñenme, que vendrán por lana y volverán trasquilados; y a quien Dios
quiere bien, la casa le sabe; y las necedades del rico por sentencias pasan
en el mundo; y, siéndolo yo, siendo gobernador y juntamente liberal, como
lo pienso ser, no habrá falta que se me parezca. No, sino haceos miel, y
paparos han moscas; tanto vales cuanto tienes, decía una mi agüela, y del
hombre arraigado no te verás vengado.
— ¡Oh, maldito seas de Dios, Sancho! —dijo a esta sazón don Quijote—.
¡Sesenta mil satanases te lleven a ti y a tus refranes! Una hora ha que los
estás ensartando y dándome con cada uno tragos de tormento. Yo te aseguro
que estos refranes te han de llevar un día a la horca; por ellos te han de
quitar el gobierno tus vasallos, o ha de haber entre ellos comunidades.
Dime, ¿dónde los hallas, ignorante, o cómo los aplicas, mentecato, que para
decir yo uno y aplicarle bien, sudo y trabajo como si cavase?
— Por Dios, señor nuestro amo —replicó Sancho—, que vuesa merced se queja de
bien pocas cosas. ¿A qué diablos se pudre de que yo me sirva de mi
hacienda, que ninguna otra tengo, ni otro caudal alguno, sino refranes y
más refranes? Y ahora se me ofrecen cuatro que venían aquí pintiparados, o
como peras en tabaque, pero no los diré, porque al buen callar llaman
Sancho.
— Ese Sancho no eres tú —dijo don Quijote—, porque no sólo no eres buen
callar, sino mal hablar y mal porfiar; y, con todo eso, querría saber qué
cuatro refranes te ocurrían ahora a la memoria que venían aquí a propósito,
que yo ando recorriendo la mía, que la tengo buena, y ninguno se me ofrece.
— ¿Qué mejores —dijo Sancho— que "entre dos muelas cordales nunca pongas tus
pulgares", y "a idos de mi casa y qué queréis con mi mujer, no hay
responder", y "si da el cántaro en la piedra o la piedra en el cántaro, mal
para el cántaro", todos los cuales vienen a pelo? Que nadie se tome con su
gobernador ni con el que le manda, porque saldrá lastimado, como el que
pone el dedo entre dos muelas cordales, y aunque no sean cordales, como
sean muelas, no importa; y a lo que dijere el gobernador no hay que
replicar, como al "salíos de mi casa y qué queréis con mi mujer". Pues lo
de la piedra en el cántaro un ciego lo verá. Así que, es menester que el
que vee la mota en el ojo ajeno, vea la viga en el suyo, porque no se diga
por él: "espantóse la muerta de la degollada", y vuestra merced sabe bien
que más sabe el necio en su casa que el cuerdo en la ajena.
— Eso no, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que el necio en su casa ni en la
ajena sabe nada, a causa que sobre el aumento de la necedad no asienta
ningún discreto edificio. Y dejemos esto aquí, Sancho, que si mal
gobernares, tuya será la culpa, y mía la vergüenza; mas consuélome que he
hecho lo que debía en aconsejarte con las veras y con la discreción a mí
posible: con esto salgo de mi obligación y de mi promesa. Dios te guíe,
Sancho, y te gobierne en tu gobierno, y a mí me saque del escrúpulo que me
queda que has de dar con toda la ínsula patas arriba, cosa que pudiera yo
escusar con descubrir al duque quién eres, diciéndole que toda esa gordura
y esa personilla que tienes no es otra cosa que un costal lleno de refranes
y de malicias.
— Señor —replicó Sancho—, si a vuestra merced le parece que no soy de pro
para este gobierno, desde aquí le suelto, que más quiero un solo negro de
la uña de mi alma que a todo mi cuerpo; y así me sustentaré Sancho a secas
con pan y cebolla, como gobernador con perdices y capones; y más que,
mientras se duerme, todos son iguales, los grandes y los menores, los
pobres y los ricos; y si vuestra merced mira en ello, verá que sólo vuestra
merced me ha puesto en esto de gobernar: que yo no sé más de gobiernos de
ínsulas que un buitre; y si se imagina que por ser gobernador me ha de
llevar el diablo, más me quiero ir Sancho al cielo que gobernador al
infierno.
— Por Dios, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que, por solas estas últimas razones
que has dicho, juzgo que mereces ser gobernador de mil ínsulas: buen
natural tienes, sin el cual no hay ciencia que valga; encomiéndate a Dios,
y procura no errar en la primera intención; quiero decir que siempre tengas
intento y firme propósito de acertar en cuantos negocios te ocurrieren,
porque siempre favorece el cielo los buenos deseos. Y vámonos a comer, que
creo que ya estos señores nos aguardan.
Capítulo XLIV. Cómo Sancho Panza fue llevado al gobierno, y de la estraña
aventura que en el castillo sucedió a don Quijote
Dicen que en el propio original desta historia se lee que, llegando Cide
Hamete a escribir este capítulo, no le tradujo su intérprete como él le
había escrito, que fue un modo de queja que tuvo el moro de sí mismo, por
haber tomado entre manos una historia tan seca y tan limitada como esta de
don Quijote, por parecerle que siempre había de hablar dél y de Sancho, sin
osar estenderse a otras digresiones y episodios más graves y más
entretenidos; y decía que el ir siempre atenido el entendimiento, la mano y
la pluma a escribir de un solo sujeto y hablar por las bocas de pocas
personas era un trabajo incomportable, cuyo fruto no redundaba en el de su
autor, y que, por huir deste inconveniente, había usado en la primera parte
del artificio de algunas novelas, como fueron la del Curioso impertinente y
la del Capitán cautivo, que están como separadas de la historia, puesto que
las demás que allí se cuentan son casos sucedidos al mismo don Quijote, que
no podían dejar de escribirse. También pensó, como él dice, que muchos,
llevados de la atención que piden las hazañas de don Quijote, no la darían
a las novelas, y pasarían por ellas, o con priesa o con enfado, sin
advertir la gala y artificio que en sí contienen, el cual se mostrara bien
al descubierto cuando, por sí solas, sin arrimarse a las locuras de don
Quijote ni a las sandeces de Sancho, salieran a luz. Y así, en esta segunda
parte no quiso ingerir novelas sueltas ni pegadizas, sino algunos episodios
que lo pareciesen, nacidos de los mesmos sucesos que la verdad ofrece; y
aun éstos, limitadamente y con solas las palabras que bastan a
declararlos; y, pues se contiene y cierra en los estrechos límites de la
narración, teniendo habilidad, suficiencia y entendimiento para tratar del
universo todo, pide no se desprecie su trabajo, y se le den alabanzas, no
por lo que escribe, sino por lo que ha dejado de escribir.
Y luego prosigue la historia diciendo que, en acabando de comer don
Quijote, el día que dio los consejos a Sancho, aquella tarde se los dio
escritos, para que él buscase quien se los leyese; pero, apenas se los hubo
dado, cuando se le cayeron y vinieron a manos del duque, que los comunicó
con la duquesa, y los dos se admiraron de nuevo de la locura y del ingenio
de don Quijote; y así, llevando adelante sus burlas, aquella tarde enviaron
a Sancho con mucho acompañamiento al lugar que para él había de ser ínsula.
Acaeció, pues, que el que le llevaba a cargo era un mayordomo del duque,
muy discreto y muy gracioso —que no puede haber gracia donde no hay
discreción—, el cual había hecho la persona de la condesa Trifaldi, con el
donaire que queda referido; y con esto, y con ir industriado de sus
señores de cómo se había de haber con Sancho, salió con su intento
maravillosamente. Digo, pues, que acaeció que, así como Sancho vio al tal
mayordomo, se le figuró en su rostro el mesmo de la Trifaldi, y,
volviéndose a su señor, le dijo:
— Señor, o a mí me ha de llevar el diablo de aquí de donde estoy, en justo
y en creyente, o vuestra merced me ha de confesar que el rostro deste
mayordomo del duque, que aquí está, es el mesmo de la Dolorida.
Miró don Quijote atentamente al mayordomo, y, habiéndole mirado, dijo a
Sancho:
— No hay para qué te lleve el diablo, Sancho, ni en justo ni en creyente,
que no sé lo que quieres decir; que el rostro de la Dolorida es el del
mayordomo, pero no por eso el mayordomo es la Dolorida; que, a serlo,
implicaría contradición muy grande, y no es tiempo ahora de hacer estas
averiguaciones, que sería entrarnos en intricados laberintos. Créeme,
amigo, que es menester rogar a Nuestro Señor muy de veras que nos libre a
los dos de malos hechiceros y de malos encantadores.
— No es burla, señor —replicó Sancho—, sino que denantes le oí hablar, y no
pareció sino que la voz de la Trifaldi me sonaba en los oídos. Ahora bien,
yo callaré, pero no dejaré de andar advertido de aquí adelante, a ver si
descubre otra señal que confirme o desfaga mi sospecha.
— Así lo has de hacer, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, y darásme aviso de todo lo
que en este caso descubrieres y de todo aquello que en el gobierno te
sucediere.
Salió, en fin, Sancho, acompañado de mucha gente, vestido a lo letrado, y
encima un gabán muy ancho de chamelote de aguas leonado, con una montera de
lo mesmo, sobre un macho a la jineta, y detrás dél, por orden del duque,
iba el rucio con jaeces y ornamentos jumentiles de seda y flamantes. Volvía
Sancho la cabeza de cuando en cuando a mirar a su asno, con cuya compañía
iba tan contento que no se trocara con el emperador de Alemaña.
Al despedirse de los duques, les besó las manos, y tomó la bendición de su
señor, que se la dio con lágrimas, y Sancho la recibió con pucheritos.
Deja, lector amable, ir en paz y en hora buena al buen Sancho, y espera dos
fanegas de risa, que te ha de causar el saber cómo se portó en su cargo, y,
en tanto, atiende a saber lo que le pasó a su amo aquella noche; que si con
ello no rieres, por lo menos desplegarás los labios con risa de jimia,
porque los sucesos de don Quijote, o se han de celebrar con admiración, o
con risa.
Cuéntase, pues, que, apenas se hubo partido Sancho, cuando don Quijote
sintió su soledad; y si le fuera posible revocarle la comisión y quitarle
el gobierno, lo hiciera. Conoció la duquesa su melancolía, y preguntóle que
de qué estaba triste; que si era por la ausencia de Sancho, que escuderos,
dueñas y doncellas había en su casa que le servirían muy a satisfación de
su deseo.
— Verdad es, señora mía —respondió don Quijote—, que siento la ausencia de
Sancho, pero no es ésa la causa principal que me hace parecer que estoy
triste, y, de los muchos ofrecimientos que vuestra excelencia me hace,
solamente acepto y escojo el de la voluntad con que se me hacen, y, en lo
demás, suplico a Vuestra Excelencia que dentro de mi aposento consienta y
permita que yo solo sea el que me sirva.
— En verdad —dijo la duquesa—, señor don Quijote, que no ha de ser así: que
le han de servir cuatro doncellas de las mías, hermosas como unas flores.
— Para mí —respondió don Quijote— no serán ellas como flores, sino como
espinas que me puncen el alma. Así entrarán ellas en mi aposento, ni cosa
que lo parezca, como volar. Si es que vuestra grandeza quiere llevar
adelante el hacerme merced sin yo merecerla, déjeme que yo me las haya
conmigo, y que yo me sirva de mis puertas adentro, que yo ponga una muralla
en medio de mis deseos y de mi honestidad; y no quiero perder esta
costumbre por la liberalidad que vuestra alteza quiere mostrar conmigo. Y,
en resolución, antes dormiré vestido que consentir que nadie me desnude.
— No más, no más, señor don Quijote —replicó la duquesa—. Por mí digo que
daré orden que ni aun una mosca entre en su estancia, no que una doncella;
no soy yo persona, que por mí se ha de descabalar la decencia del señor don
Quijote; que, según se me ha traslucido, la que más campea entre sus muchas
virtudes es la de la honestidad. Desnúdese vuesa merced y vístase a sus
solas y a su modo, como y cuando quisiere, que no habrá quien lo impida,
pues dentro de su aposento hallará los vasos necesarios al menester del que
duerme a puerta cerrada, porque ninguna natural necesidad le obligue a que
la abra. Viva mil siglos la gran Dulcinea del Toboso, y sea su nombre
estendido por toda la redondez de la tierra, pues mereció ser amada de tan
valiente y tan honesto caballero, y los benignos cielos infundan en el
corazón de Sancho Panza, nuestro gobernador, un deseo de acabar presto sus
diciplinas, para que vuelva a gozar el mundo de la belleza de tan gran
señora.
A lo cual dijo don Quijote:
— Vuestra altitud ha hablado como quien es, que en la boca de las buenas
señoras no ha de haber ninguna que sea mala; y más venturosa y más conocida
será en el mundo Dulcinea por haberla alabado vuestra grandeza, que por
todas las alabanzas que puedan darle los más elocuentes de la tierra.
— Agora bien, señor don Quijote —replicó la duquesa—, la hora de cenar se
llega, y el duque debe de esperar: venga vuesa merced y cenemos, y
acostaráse temprano, que el viaje que ayer hizo de Candaya no fue tan corto
que no haya causado algún molimiento.
— No siento ninguno, señora —respondió don Quijote—, porque osaré jurar a
Vuestra Excelencia que en mi vida he subido sobre bestia más reposada ni de
mejor paso que Clavileño; y no sé yo qué le pudo mover a Malambruno para
deshacerse de tan ligera y tan gentil cabalgadura, y abrasarla así, sin más
ni más.
— A eso se puede imaginar —respondió la duquesa— que, arrepentido del mal
que había hecho a la Trifaldi y compañía, y a otras personas, y de las
maldades que como hechicero y encantador debía de haber cometido, quiso
concluir con todos los instrumentos de su oficio, y, como a principal y que
más le traía desasosegado, vagando de tierra en tierra, abrasó a Clavileño;
que con sus abrasadas cenizas y con el trofeo del cartel queda eterno el
valor del gran don Quijote de la Mancha.
De nuevo nuevas gracias dio don Quijote a la duquesa, y, en cenando, don
Quijote se retiró en su aposento solo, sin consentir que nadie entrase con
él a servirle: tanto se temía de encontrar ocasiones que le moviesen o
forzasen a perder el honesto decoro que a su señora Dulcinea guardaba,
siempre puesta en la imaginación la bondad de Amadís, flor y espejo de los
andantes caballeros. Cerró tras sí la puerta, y a la luz de dos velas de
cera se desnudó, y al descalzarse —¡oh desgracia indigna de tal persona!—
se le soltaron, no suspiros, ni otra cosa, que desacreditasen la limpieza
de su policía, sino hasta dos docenas de puntos de una media, que quedó
hecha celosía. Afligióse en estremo el buen señor, y diera él por tener
allí un adarme de seda verde una onza de plata; digo seda verde porque las
medias eran verdes.
Aquí exclamó Benengeli, y, escribiendo, dijo ''¡Oh pobreza, pobreza! ¡No sé
yo con qué razón se movió aquel gran poeta cordobés a llamarte
dádiva santa desagradecida!
Yo, aunque moro, bien sé, por la comunicación que he tenido con cristianos,
que la santidad consiste en la caridad, humildad, fee, obediencia y
pobreza; pero, con todo eso, digo que ha de tener mucho de Dios el que se
viniere a contentar con ser pobre, si no es de aquel modo de pobreza de
quien dice uno de sus mayores santos: "Tened todas las cosas como si no las
tuviésedes"; y a esto llaman pobreza de espíritu; pero tú, segunda pobreza,
que eres de la que yo hablo, ¿por qué quieres estrellarte con los hidalgos
y bien nacidos más que con la otra gente? ¿Por qué los obligas a dar
pantalia a los zapatos, y a que los botones de sus ropillas unos sean de
seda, otros de cerdas, y otros de vidro? ¿Por qué sus cuellos, por la mayor
parte, han de ser siempre escarolados, y no abiertos con molde?'' Y en esto
se echará de ver que es antiguo el uso del almidón y de los cuellos
abiertos. Y prosiguió: ''¡Miserable del bien nacido que va dando pistos a
su honra, comiendo mal y a puerta cerrada, haciendo hipócrita al palillo de
dientes con que sale a la calle después de no haber comido cosa que le
obligue a limpiárselos! ¡Miserable de aquel, digo, que tiene la honra
espantadiza, y piensa que desde una legua se le descubre el remiendo del
zapato, el trasudor del sombrero, la hilaza del herreruelo y la hambre de
su estómago!''
Todo esto se le renovó a don Quijote en la soltura de sus puntos, pero
consolóse con ver que Sancho le había dejado unas botas de camino, que
pensó ponerse otro día. Finalmente, él se recostó pensativo y pesaroso, así
de la falta que Sancho le hacía como de la inreparable desgracia de sus
medias, a quien tomara los puntos, aunque fuera con seda de otra color, que
es una de las mayores señales de miseria que un hidalgo puede dar en el
discurso de su prolija estrecheza. Mató las velas; hacía calor y no podía
dormir; levantóse del lecho y abrió un poco la ventana de una reja que daba
sobre un hermoso jardín, y, al abrirla, sintió y oyó que andaba y hablaba
gente en el jardín. Púsose a escuchar atentamente. Levantaron la voz los de
abajo, tanto, que pudo oír estas razones:
— No me porfíes, ¡oh Emerencia!, que cante, pues sabes que, desde el punto
que este forastero entró en este castillo y mis ojos le miraron, yo no sé
cantar, sino llorar; cuanto más, que el sueño de mi señora tiene más de
ligero que de pesado, y no querría que nos hallase aquí por todo el tesoro
del mundo. Y, puesto caso que durmiese y no despertase, en vano sería mi
canto si duerme y no despierta para oírle este nuevo Eneas, que ha llegado
a mis regiones para dejarme escarnida.
— No des en eso, Altisidora amiga —respondieron—, que sin duda la duquesa y
cuantos hay en esa casa duermen, si no es el señor de tu corazón y el
despertador de tu alma, porque ahora sentí que abría la ventana de la reja
de su estancia, y sin duda debe de estar despierto; canta, lastimada mía,
en tono bajo y suave al son de tu arpa, y, cuando la duquesa nos sienta, le
echaremos la culpa al calor que hace.
— No está en eso el punto, ¡oh Emerencia! —respondió la Altisidora—, sino en
que no querría que mi canto descubriese mi corazón y fuese juzgada de los
que no tienen noticia de las fuerzas poderosas de amor por doncella
antojadiza y liviana. Pero venga lo que viniere, que más vale vergüenza en
cara que mancilla en corazón.
Y, en esto, sintió tocar una arpa suavísimamente. Oyendo lo cual, quedó don
Quijote pasmado, porque en aquel instante se le vinieron a la memoria las
infinitas aventuras semejantes a aquélla, de ventanas, rejas y jardines,
músicas, requiebros y desvanecimientos que en los sus desvanecidos libros
de caballerías había leído. Luego imaginó que alguna doncella de la duquesa
estaba dél enamorada, y que la honestidad la forzaba a tener secreta su
voluntad; temió no le rindiese, y propuso en su pensamiento el no dejarse
vencer; y, encomendándose de todo buen ánimo y buen talante a su señora
Dulcinea del Toboso, determinó de escuchar la música; y, para dar a
entender que allí estaba, dio un fingido estornudo, de que no poco se
alegraron las doncellas, que otra cosa no deseaban sino que don Quijote las
oyese. Recorrida, pues, y afinada la arpa, Altisidora dio principio a este
romance:
-¡Oh, tú, que estás en tu lecho,
entre sábanas de holanda,
durmiendo a pierna tendida
de la noche a la mañana,
caballero el más valiente
que ha producido la Mancha,
más honesto y más bendito
que el oro fino de Arabia!
Oye a una triste doncella,
bien crecida y mal lograda,
que en la luz de tus dos soles
se siente abrasar el alma.
Tú buscas tus aventuras,
y ajenas desdichas hallas;
das las feridas, y niegas
el remedio de sanarlas.
Dime, valeroso joven,
que Dios prospere tus ansias,
si te criaste en la Libia,
o en las montañas de Jaca;
si sierpes te dieron leche;
si, a dicha, fueron tus amas
la aspereza de las selvas
y el horror de las montañas.
Muy bien puede Dulcinea,
doncella rolliza y sana,
preciarse de que ha rendido
a una tigre y fiera brava.
Por esto será famosa
desde Henares a Jarama,
desde el Tajo a Manzanares,
desde Pisuerga hasta Arlanza.
Trocáreme yo por ella,
y diera encima una saya
de las más gayadas mías,
que de oro le adornan franjas.
¡Oh, quién se viera en tus brazos,
o si no, junto a tu cama,
rascándote la cabeza
y matándote la caspa!
Mucho pido, y no soy digna
de merced tan señalada:
los pies quisiera traerte,
que a una humilde esto le basta.
¡Oh, qué de cofias te diera,
qué de escarpines de plata,
qué de calzas de damasco,
qué de herreruelos de holanda!
¡Qué de finísimas perlas,
cada cual como una agalla,
que, a no tener compañeras,
Las solas fueran llamadas!
No mires de tu Tarpeya
este incendio que me abrasa,
Nerón manchego del mundo,
ni le avives con tu saña.
Niña soy, pulcela tierna,
mi edad de quince no pasa:
catorce tengo y tres meses,
te juro en Dios y en mi ánima.
No soy renca, ni soy coja,
ni tengo nada de manca;
los cabellos, como lirios,
que, en pie, por el suelo arrastran.
Y, aunque es mi boca aguileña
y la nariz algo chata,
ser mis dientes de topacios
mi belleza al cielo ensalza.
Mi voz, ya ves, si me escuchas,
que a la que es más dulce iguala,
y soy de disposición
algo menos que mediana.
Estas y otras gracias mías,
son despojos de tu aljaba;
desta casa soy doncella,
y Altisidora me llaman.
Aquí dio fin el canto de la malferida Altisidora, y comenzó el asombro del
requirido don Quijote, el cual, dando un gran suspiro, dijo entre sí:
— ¡Que tengo de ser tan desdichado andante, que no ha de haber doncella que
me mire que de mí no se enamore...! ¡Que tenga de ser tan corta de ventura
la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso, que no la han de dejar a solas gozar de la
incomparable firmeza mía...! ¿Qué la queréis, reinas? ¿A qué la perseguís,
emperatrices? ¿Para qué la acosáis, doncellas de a catorce a quince años?
Dejad, dejad a la miserable que triunfe, se goce y ufane con la suerte que
Amor quiso darle en rendirle mi corazón y entregarle mi alma. Mirad,
caterva enamorada, que para sola Dulcinea soy de masa y de alfenique, y
para todas las demás soy de pedernal; para ella soy miel, y para vosotras
acíbar; para mí sola Dulcinea es la hermosa, la discreta, la honesta, la
gallarda y la bien nacida, y las demás, las feas, las necias, las livianas
y las de peor linaje; para ser yo suyo, y no de otra alguna, me arrojó la
naturaleza al mundo. Llore o cante Altisidora; desespérese Madama, por
quien me aporrearon en el castillo del moro encantado, que yo tengo de ser
de Dulcinea, cocido o asado, limpio, bien criado y honesto, a pesar de
todas las potestades hechiceras de la tierra.
Y, con esto, cerró de golpe la ventana, y, despechado y pesaroso, como si
le hubiera acontecido alguna gran desgracia, se acostó en su lecho, donde
le dejaremos por ahora, porque nos está llamando el gran Sancho Panza, que
quiere dar principio a su famoso gobierno.
Capítulo XLV. De cómo el gran Sancho Panza tomó la posesión de su ínsula, y
del modo que comenzó a gobernar
¡Oh perpetuo descubridor de los antípodas, hacha del mundo, ojo del cielo,
meneo dulce de las cantimploras, Timbrio aquí, Febo allí, tirador acá,
médico acullá, padre de la Poesía, inventor de la Música: tú que siempre
sales, y, aunque lo parece, nunca te pones! A ti digo, ¡oh sol, con cuya
ayuda el hombre engendra al hombre!; a ti digo que me favorezcas, y
alumbres la escuridad de mi ingenio, para que pueda discurrir por sus
puntos en la narración del gobierno del gran Sancho Panza; que sin ti, yo
me siento tibio, desmazalado y confuso.
Digo, pues, que con todo su acompañamiento llegó Sancho a un lugar de hasta
mil vecinos, que era de los mejores que el duque tenía. Diéronle a entender
que se llamaba la ínsula Barataria, o ya porque el lugar se llamaba
Baratario, o ya por el barato con que se le había dado el gobierno. Al
llegar a las puertas de la villa, que era cercada, salió el regimiento del
pueblo a recebirle; tocaron las campanas, y todos los vecinos dieron
muestras de general alegría, y con mucha pompa le llevaron a la iglesia
mayor a dar gracias a Dios, y luego, con algunas ridículas ceremonias, le
entregaron las llaves del pueblo, y le admitieron por perpetuo gobernador
de la ínsula Barataria.
El traje, las barbas, la gordura y pequeñez del nuevo gobernador tenía
admirada a toda la gente que el busilis del cuento no sabía, y aun a todos
los que lo sabían, que eran muchos. Finalmente, en sacándole de la iglesia,
le llevaron a la silla del juzgado y le sentaron en ella; y el mayordomo
del duque le dijo:
— Es costumbre antigua en esta ínsula, señor gobernador, que el que viene a
tomar posesión desta famosa ínsula está obligado a responder a una pregunta
que se le hiciere, que sea algo intricada y dificultosa, de cuya respuesta
el pueblo toma y toca el pulso del ingenio de su nuevo gobernador; y así, o
se alegra o se entristece con su venida.
En tanto que el mayordomo decía esto a Sancho, estaba él mirando unas
grandes y muchas letras que en la pared frontera de su silla estaban
escritas; y, como él no sabía leer, preguntó que qué eran aquellas pinturas
que en aquella pared estaban. Fuele respondido:
— Señor, allí esta escrito y notado el día en que Vuestra Señoría tomó
posesión desta ínsula, y dice el epitafio: Hoy día, a tantos de tal mes y
de tal año, tomó la posesión desta ínsula el señor don Sancho Panza, que
muchos años la goce.
— Y ¿a quién llaman don Sancho Panza? —preguntó Sancho.
— A vuestra señoría —respondió el mayordomo—, que en esta ínsula no ha
entrado otro Panza sino el que está sentado en esa silla.
— Pues advertid, hermano —dijo Sancho—, que yo no tengo don, ni en todo mi
linaje le ha habido: Sancho Panza me llaman a secas, y Sancho se llamó mi
padre, y Sancho mi agüelo, y todos fueron Panzas, sin añadiduras de dones
ni donas; y yo imagino que en esta ínsula debe de haber más dones que
piedras; pero basta: Dios me entiende, y podrá ser que, si el gobierno me
dura cuatro días, yo escardaré estos dones, que, por la muchedumbre, deben
de enfadar como los mosquitos. Pase adelante con su pregunta el señor
mayordomo, que yo responderé lo mejor que supiere, ora se entristezca o no
se entristezca el pueblo.
A este instante entraron en el juzgado dos hombres, el uno vestido de
labrador y el otro de sastre, porque traía unas tijeras en la mano, y el
sastre dijo:
— Señor gobernador, yo y este hombre labrador venimos ante vuestra merced en
razón que este buen hombre llegó a mi tienda ayer (que yo, con perdón de
los presentes, soy sastre examinado, que Dios sea bendito), y, poniéndome
un pedazo de paño en las manos, me preguntó: ''Señor, ¿habría en esto
paño harto para hacerme una caperuza?'' Yo, tanteando el paño, le respondí
que sí; él debióse de imaginar, a lo que yo imagino, e imaginé bien, que
sin duda yo le quería hurtar alguna parte del paño, fundándose en su
malicia y en la mala opinión de los sastres, y replicóme que mirase si
habría para dos; adivinéle el pensamiento y díjele que sí; y él, caballero
en su dañada y primera intención, fue añadiendo caperuzas, y yo añadiendo
síes, hasta que llegamos a cinco caperuzas, y ahora en este punto acaba de
venir por ellas: yo se las doy, y no me quiere pagar la hechura, antes me
pide que le pague o vuelva su paño.
— ¿Es todo esto así, hermano? —preguntó Sancho.
— Sí, señor —respondió el hombre—, pero hágale vuestra merced que muestre
las cinco caperuzas que me ha hecho.
— De buena gana —respondió el sastre.
Y, sacando encontinente la mano debajo del herreruelo, mostró en ella cinco
caperuzas puestas en las cinco cabezas de los dedos de la mano, y dijo:
— He aquí las cinco caperuzas que este buen hombre me pide, y en Dios y en
mi conciencia que no me ha quedado nada del paño, y yo daré la obra a vista
de veedores del oficio.
Todos los presentes se rieron de la multitud de las caperuzas y del nuevo
pleito. Sancho se puso a considerar un poco, y dijo:
— Paréceme que en este pleito no ha de haber largas dilaciones, sino juzgar
luego a juicio de buen varón; y así, yo doy por sentencia que el sastre
pierda las hechuras, y el labrador el paño, y las caperuzas se lleven a los
presos de la cárcel, y no haya más.
Si la sentencia pasada de la bolsa del ganadero movió a admiración a los
circunstantes, ésta les provocó a risa; pero, en fin, se hizo lo que mandó
el gobernador; ante el cual se presentaron dos hombres ancianos; el uno
traía una cañaheja por báculo, y el sin báculo dijo:
— Señor, a este buen hombre le presté días ha diez escudos de oro en oro,
por hacerle placer y buena obra, con condición que me los volviese cuando
se los pidiese; pasáronse muchos días sin pedírselos, por no ponerle en
mayor necesidad de volvérmelos que la que él tenía cuando yo se los presté;
pero, por parecerme que se descuidaba en la paga, se los he pedido una y
muchas veces, y no solamente no me los vuelve, pero me los niega y dice que
nunca tales diez escudos le presté, y que si se los presté, que ya me los
ha vuelto. Yo no tengo testigos ni del prestado ni de la vuelta, porque no
me los ha vuelto; querría que vuestra merced le tomase juramento, y si
jurare que me los ha vuelto, yo se los perdono para aquí y para delante de
Dios.
— ¿Qué decís vos a esto, buen viejo del báculo? —dijo Sancho.
A lo que dijo el viejo:
— Yo, señor, confieso que me los prestó, y baje vuestra merced esa vara; y,
pues él lo deja en mi juramento, yo juraré como se los he vuelto y pagado
real y verdaderamente.
Bajó el gobernador la vara, y, en tanto, el viejo del báculo dio el báculo
al otro viejo, que se le tuviese en tanto que juraba, como si le embarazara
mucho, y luego puso la mano en la cruz de la vara, diciendo que era verdad
que se le habían prestado aquellos diez escudos que se le pedían; pero que
él se los había vuelto de su mano a la suya, y que por no caer en ello se
los volvía a pedir por momentos. Viendo lo cual el gran gobernador,
preguntó al acreedor qué respondía a lo que decía su contrario; y dijo que
sin duda alguna su deudor debía de decir verdad, porque le tenía por hombre
de bien y buen cristiano, y que a él se le debía de haber olvidado el cómo
y cuándo se los había vuelto, y que desde allí en adelante jamás le pidiría
nada. Tornó a tomar su báculo el deudor, y, bajando la cabeza, se salió del
juzgado. Visto lo cual Sancho, y que sin más ni más se iba, y viendo
también la paciencia del demandante, inclinó la cabeza sobre el pecho, y,
poniéndose el índice de la mano derecha sobre las cejas y las narices,
estuvo como pensativo un pequeño espacio, y luego alzó la cabeza y mandó
que le llamasen al viejo del báculo, que ya se había ido. Trujéronsele, y,
en viéndole Sancho, le dijo:
— Dadme, buen hombre, ese báculo, que le he menester.
— De muy buena gana —respondió el viejo—: hele aquí, señor.
Y púsosele en la mano. Tomóle Sancho, y, dándosele al otro viejo, le dijo:
— Andad con Dios, que ya vais pagado.
— ¿Yo, señor? —respondió el viejo—. Pues, ¿vale esta cañaheja diez escudos
de oro?
— Sí —dijo el gobernador—; o si no, yo soy el mayor porro del mundo. Y ahora
se verá si tengo yo caletre para gobernar todo un reino.
Y mandó que allí, delante de todos, se rompiese y abriese la caña. Hízose
así, y en el corazón della hallaron diez escudos en oro. Quedaron todos
admirados, y tuvieron a su gobernador por un nuevo Salomón.
Preguntáronle de dónde había colegido que en aquella cañaheja estaban
aquellos diez escudos, y respondió que de haberle visto dar el viejo que
juraba, a su contrario, aquel báculo, en tanto que hacía el juramento, y
jurar que se los había dado real y verdaderamente, y que, en acabando de
jurar, le tornó a pedir el báculo, le vino a la imaginación que dentro dél
estaba la paga de lo que pedían. De donde se podía colegir que los que
gobiernan, aunque sean unos tontos, tal vez los encamina Dios en sus
juicios; y más, que él había oído contar otro caso como aquél al cura de su
lugar, y que él tenía tan gran memoria, que, a no olvidársele todo aquello
de que quería acordarse, no hubiera tal memoria en toda la ínsula.
Finalmente, el un viejo corrido y el otro pagado, se fueron, y los
presentes quedaron admirados, y el que escribía las palabras, hechos y
movimientos de Sancho no acababa de determinarse si le tendría y pondría
por tonto o por discreto.
Luego, acabado este pleito, entró en el juzgado una mujer asida fuertemente
de un hombre vestido de ganadero rico, la cual venía dando grandes voces,
diciendo:
— ¡Justicia, señor gobernador, justicia, y si no la hallo en la tierra, la
iré a buscar al cielo! Señor gobernador de mi ánima, este mal hombre me ha
cogido en la mitad dese campo, y se ha aprovechado de mi cuerpo como si
fuera trapo mal lavado, y, ¡desdichada de mí!, me ha llevado lo que yo
tenía guardado más de veinte y tres años ha, defendiéndolo de moros y
cristianos, de naturales y estranjeros; y yo, siempre dura como un
alcornoque, conservándome entera como la salamanquesa en el fuego, o como
la lana entre las zarzas, para que este buen hombre llegase ahora con sus
manos limpias a manosearme.
— Aun eso está por averiguar: si tiene limpias o no las manos este galán
— dijo Sancho.
Y, volviéndose al hombre, le dijo qué decía y respondía a la querella de
aquella mujer. El cual, todo turbado, respondió:
— Señores, yo soy un pobre ganadero de ganado de cerda, y esta mañana salía
deste lugar de vender, con perdón sea dicho, cuatro puercos, que me
llevaron de alcabalas y socaliñas poco menos de lo que ellos valían;
volvíame a mi aldea, topé en el camino a esta buena dueña, y el diablo, que
todo lo añasca y todo lo cuece, hizo que yogásemos juntos; paguéle lo
soficiente, y ella, mal contenta, asió de mí, y no me ha dejado hasta
traerme a este puesto. Dice que la forcé, y miente, para el juramento que
hago o pienso hacer; y ésta es toda la verdad, sin faltar meaja.
Entonces el gobernador le preguntó si traía consigo algún dinero en plata;
él dijo que hasta veinte ducados tenía en el seno, en una bolsa de cuero.
Mandó que la sacase y se la entregase, así como estaba, a la querellante;
él lo hizo temblando; tomóla la mujer, y, haciendo mil zalemas a todos y
rogando a Dios por la vida y salud del señor gobernador, que así miraba por
las huérfanas menesterosas y doncellas; y con esto se salió del juzgado,
llevando la bolsa asida con entrambas manos, aunque primero miró si era de
plata la moneda que llevaba dentro.
Apenas salió, cuando Sancho dijo al ganadero, que ya se le saltaban las
lágrimas, y los ojos y el corazón se iban tras su bolsa:
— Buen hombre, id tras aquella mujer y quitadle la bolsa, aunque no quiera,
y volved aquí con ella.
Y no lo dijo a tonto ni a sordo, porque luego partió como un rayo y fue a
lo que se le mandaba. Todos los presentes estaban suspensos, esperando el
fin de aquel pleito, y de allí a poco volvieron el hombre y la mujer más
asidos y aferrados que la vez primera: ella la saya levantada y en el
regazo puesta la bolsa, y el hombre pugnando por quitársela; mas no era
posible, según la mujer la defendía, la cual daba voces diciendo:
— ¡Justicia de Dios y del mundo! Mire vuestra merced, señor gobernador, la
poca vergüenza y el poco temor deste desalmado, que, en mitad de poblado y
en mitad de la calle, me ha querido quitar la bolsa que vuestra merced
mandó darme.
— Y ¿háosla quitado? —preguntó el gobernador.
— ¿Cómo quitar? —respondió la mujer—. Antes me dejara yo quitar la vida que
me quiten la bolsa. ¡Bonita es la niña! ¡Otros gatos me han de echar a las
barbas, que no este desventurado y asqueroso! ¡Tenazas y martillos, mazos y
escoplos no serán bastantes a sacármela de las uñas, ni aun garras de
leones: antes el ánima de en mitad en mitad de las carnes!
— Ella tiene razón —dijo el hombre—, y yo me doy por rendido y sin fuerzas,
y confieso que las mías no son bastantes para quitársela, y déjola.
Entonces el gobernador dijo a la mujer:
— Mostrad, honrada y valiente, esa bolsa.
Ella se la dio luego, y el gobernador se la volvió al hombre, y dijo a la
esforzada y no forzada:
— Hermana mía, si el mismo aliento y valor que habéis mostrado para defender
esta bolsa le mostrárades, y aun la mitad menos, para defender vuestro
cuerpo, las fuerzas de Hércules no os hicieran fuerza. Andad con Dios, y
mucho de enhoramala, y no paréis en toda esta ínsula ni en seis leguas a la
redonda, so pena de docientos azotes. ¡Andad luego digo, churrillera,
desvergonzada y embaidora!
Espantóse la mujer y fuese cabizbaja y mal contenta, y el gobernador dijo
al hombre:
— Buen hombre, andad con Dios a vuestro lugar con vuestro dinero, y de aquí
adelante, si no le queréis perder, procurad que no os venga en voluntad de
yogar con nadie.
El hombre le dio las gracias lo peor que supo, y fuese, y los circunstantes
quedaron admirados de nuevo de los juicios y sentencias de su nuevo
gobernador. Todo lo cual, notado de su coronista, fue luego escrito al
duque, que con gran deseo lo estaba esperando.
Y quédese aquí el buen Sancho, que es mucha la priesa que nos da su amo,
alborozado con la música de Altisidora.
Capítulo XLVI. Del temeroso espanto cencerril y gatuno que recibió don
Quijote en el discurso de los amores de la enamorada Altisidora
Dejamos al gran don Quijote envuelto en los pensamientos que le habían
causado la música de la enamorada doncella Altisidora. Acostóse con ellos,
y, como si fueran pulgas, no le dejaron dormir ni sosegar un punto, y
juntábansele los que le faltaban de sus medias; pero, como es ligero el
tiempo, y no hay barranco que le detenga, corrió caballero en las horas, y
con mucha presteza llegó la de la mañana. Lo cual visto por don Quijote,
dejó las blandas plumas, y, no nada perezoso, se vistió su acamuzado
vestido y se calzó sus botas de camino, por encubrir la desgracia de sus
medias; arrojóse encima su mantón de escarlata y púsose en la cabeza una
montera de terciopelo verde, guarnecida de pasamanos de plata; colgó el
tahelí de sus hombros con su buena y tajadora espada, asió un gran rosario
que consigo contino traía, y con gran prosopopeya y contoneo salió a la
antesala, donde el duque y la duquesa estaban ya vestidos y como
esperándole; y, al pasar por una galería, estaban aposta esperándole
Altisidora y la otra doncella su amiga, y, así como Altisidora vio a don
Quijote, fingió desmayarse, y su amiga la recogió en sus faldas, y con gran
presteza la iba a desabrochar el pecho. Don Quijote, que lo vio, llegándose
a ellas, dijo:
— Ya sé yo de qué proceden estos accidentes.
— No sé yo de qué —respondió la amiga—, porque Altisidora es la doncella más
sana de toda esta casa, y yo nunca la he sentido un ¡ay! en cuanto ha que
la conozco, que mal hayan cuantos caballeros andantes hay en el mundo, si
es que todos son desagradecidos. Váyase vuesa merced, señor don Quijote,
que no volverá en sí esta pobre niña en tanto que vuesa merced aquí
estuviere.
A lo que respondió don Quijote:
— Haga vuesa merced, señora, que se me ponga un laúd esta noche en mi
aposento, que yo consolaré lo mejor que pudiere a esta lastimada doncella;
que en los principios amorosos los desengaños prestos suelen ser remedios
calificados.
Y con esto se fue, porque no fuese notado de los que allí le viesen. No se
hubo bien apartado, cuando, volviendo en sí la desmayada Altisidora, dijo a
su compañera:
— Menester será que se le ponga el laúd, que sin duda don Quijote quiere
darnos música, y no será mala, siendo suya.
Fueron luego a dar cuenta a la duquesa de lo que pasaba y del laúd que
pedía don Quijote, y ella, alegre sobremodo, concertó con el duque y con
sus doncellas de hacerle una burla que fuese más risueña que dañosa, y con
mucho contento esperaban la noche, que se vino tan apriesa como se había
venido el día, el cual pasaron los duques en sabrosas pláticas con don
Quijote. Y la duquesa aquel día real y verdaderamente despachó a un paje
suyo, que había hecho en la selva la figura encantada de Dulcinea, a Teresa
Panza, con la carta de su marido Sancho Panza, y con el lío de ropa que
había dejado para que se le enviase, encargándole le trujese buena
relación de todo lo que con ella pasase.
Hecho esto, y llegadas las once horas de la noche, halló don Quijote una
vihuela en su aposento; templóla, abrió la reja, y sintió que andaba gente
en el jardín; y, habiendo recorrido los trastes de la vihuela y afinándola
lo mejor que supo, escupió y remondóse el pecho, y luego, con una voz
ronquilla, aunque entonada, cantó el siguiente romance, que él mismo aquel
día había compuesto:
-Suelen las fuerzas de amor
sacar de quicio a las almas,
tomando por instrumento
la ociosidad descuidada.
Suele el coser y el labrar,
y el estar siempre ocupada,
ser antídoto al veneno
de las amorosas ansias.
Las doncellas recogidas
que aspiran a ser casadas,
la honestidad es la dote
y voz de sus alabanzas.
Los andantes caballeros,
y los que en la corte andan,
requiébranse con las libres,
con las honestas se casan.
Hay amores de levante,
que entre huéspedes se tratan,
que llegan presto al poniente,
porque en el partirse acaban.
El amor recién venido,
que hoy llegó y se va mañana,
las imágines no deja
bien impresas en el alma.
Pintura sobre pintura
ni se muestra ni señala;
y do hay primera belleza,
la segunda no hace baza.
Dulcinea del Toboso
del alma en la tabla rasa
tengo pintada de modo
que es imposible borrarla.
La firmeza en los amantes
es la parte más preciada,
por quien hace amor milagros,
y asimesmo los levanta.
Aquí llegaba don Quijote de su canto, a quien estaban escuchando el duque y
la duquesa, Altisidora y casi toda la gente del castillo, cuando de
improviso, desde encima de un corredor que sobre la reja de don Quijote a
plomo caía, descolgaron un cordel donde venían más de cien cencerros
asidos, y luego, tras ellos, derramaron un gran saco de gatos, que asimismo
traían cencerros menores atados a las colas. Fue tan grande el ruido de los
cencerros y el mayar de los gatos, que, aunque los duques habían sido
inventores de la burla, todavía les sobresaltó; y, temeroso, don Quijote
quedó pasmado. Y quiso la suerte que dos o tres gatos se entraron por la
reja de su estancia, y, dando de una parte a otra, parecía que una región
de diablos andaba en ella. Apagaron las velas que en el aposento ardían, y
andaban buscando por do escaparse. El descolgar y subir del cordel de los
grandes cencerros no cesaba; la mayor parte de la gente del castillo, que
no sabía la verdad del caso, estaba suspensa y admirada.
Levantóse don Quijote en pie, y, poniendo mano a la espada, comenzó a tirar
estocadas por la reja y a decir a grandes voces:
— ¡Afuera, malignos encantadores! ¡Afuera, canalla hechiceresca, que yo soy
don Quijote de la Mancha, contra quien no valen ni tienen fuerza vuestras
malas intenciones!
Y, volviéndose a los gatos que andaban por el aposento, les tiró muchas
cuchilladas; ellos acudieron a la reja, y por allí se salieron, aunque uno,
viéndose tan acosado de las cuchilladas de don Quijote, le saltó al rostro
y le asió de las narices con las uñas y los dientes, por cuyo dolor don
Quijote comenzó a dar los mayores gritos que pudo. Oyendo lo cual el duque
y la duquesa, y considerando lo que podía ser, con mucha presteza acudieron
a su estancia, y, abriendo con llave maestra, vieron al pobre caballero
pugnando con todas sus fuerzas por arrancar el gato de su rostro. Entraron
con luces y vieron la desigual pelea; acudió el duque a despartirla, y don
Quijote dijo a voces:
— ¡No me le quite nadie! ¡Déjenme mano a mano con este demonio, con este
hechicero, con este encantador, que yo le daré a entender de mí a él quién
es don Quijote de la Mancha!
Pero el gato, no curándose destas amenazas, gruñía y apretaba. Mas, en fin,
el duque se le desarraigó y le echó por la reja.
Quedó don Quijote acribado el rostro y no muy sanas las narices, aunque muy
despechado porque no le habían dejado fenecer la batalla que tan trabada
tenía con aquel malandrín encantador. Hicieron traer aceite de Aparicio, y
la misma Altisidora, con sus blanquísimas manos, le puso unas vendas por
todo lo herido; y, al ponérselas, con voz baja le dijo:
— Todas estas malandanzas te suceden, empedernido caballero, por el pecado
de tu dureza y pertinacia; y plega a Dios que se le olvide a Sancho tu
escudero el azotarse, porque nunca salga de su encanto esta tan amada tuya
Dulcinea, ni tú lo goces, ni llegues a tálamo con ella, a lo menos viviendo
yo, que te adoro.
A todo esto no respondió don Quijote otra palabra si no fue dar un profundo
suspiro, y luego se tendió en su lecho, agradeciendo a los duques la
merced, no porque él tenía temor de aquella canalla gatesca, encantadora y
cencerruna, sino porque había conocido la buena intención con que habían
venido a socorrerle. Los duques le dejaron sosegar, y se fueron, pesarosos
del mal suceso de la burla; que no creyeron que tan pesada y costosa le
saliera a don Quijote aquella aventura, que le costó cinco días de
encerramiento y de cama, donde le sucedió otra aventura más gustosa que la
pasada, la cual no quiere su historiador contar ahora, por acudir a Sancho
Panza, que andaba muy solícito y muy gracioso en su gobierno.
Capítulo XLVII. Donde se prosigue cómo se portaba Sancho Panza en su
gobierno
Cuenta la historia que desde el juzgado llevaron a Sancho Panza a un
suntuoso palacio, adonde en una gran sala estaba puesta una real y
limpísima mesa; y, así como Sancho entró en la sala, sonaron chirimías, y
salieron cuatro pajes a darle aguamanos, que Sancho recibió con mucha
gravedad.
Cesó la música, sentóse Sancho a la cabecera de la mesa, porque no había
más de aquel asiento, y no otro servicio en toda ella. Púsose a su lado en
pie un personaje, que después mostró ser médico, con una varilla de ballena
en la mano. Levantaron una riquísima y blanca toalla con que estaban
cubiertas las frutas y mucha diversidad de platos de diversos manjares; uno
que parecía estudiante echó la bendición, y un paje puso un babador randado
a Sancho; otro que hacía el oficio de maestresala, llegó un plato de fruta
delante; pero, apenas hubo comido un bocado, cuando el de la varilla
tocando con ella en el plato, se le quitaron de delante con grandísima
celeridad; pero el maestresala le llegó otro de otro manjar. Iba a probarle
Sancho; pero, antes que llegase a él ni le gustase, ya la varilla había
tocado en él, y un paje alzádole con tanta presteza como el de la fruta.
Visto lo cual por Sancho, quedó suspenso, y, mirando a todos, preguntó si
se había de comer aquella comida como juego de maesecoral. A lo cual
respondió el de la vara:
— No se ha de comer, señor gobernador, sino como es uso y costumbre en las
otras ínsulas donde hay gobernadores. Yo, señor, soy médico, y estoy
asalariado en esta ínsula para serlo de los gobernadores della, y miro por
su salud mucho más que por la mía, estudiando de noche y de día, y
tanteando la complexión del gobernador, para acertar a curarle cuando
cayere enfermo; y lo principal que hago es asistir a sus comidas y cenas, y
a dejarle comer de lo que me parece que le conviene, y a quitarle lo que
imagino que le ha de hacer daño y ser nocivo al estómago; y así, mandé
quitar el plato de la fruta, por ser demasiadamente húmeda, y el plato del
otro manjar también le mandé quitar, por ser demasiadamente caliente y
tener muchas especies, que acrecientan la sed; y el que mucho bebe mata y
consume el húmedo radical, donde consiste la vida.
— Desa manera, aquel plato de perdices que están allí asadas, y, a mi
parecer, bien sazonadas, no me harán algún daño.
A lo que el médico respondió:
— Ésas no comerá el señor gobernador en tanto que yo tuviere vida.
— Pues, ¿por qué? —dijo Sancho.
Y el médico respondió:
— Porque nuestro maestro Hipócrates, norte y luz de la medicina, en un
aforismo suyo, dice: Omnis saturatio mala, perdices autem pessima. Quiere
decir: "Toda hartazga es mala; pero la de las perdices, malísima".
— Si eso es así —dijo Sancho—, vea el señor doctor de cuantos manjares hay
en esta mesa cuál me hará más provecho y cuál menos daño, y déjeme comer
dél sin que me le apalee; porque, por vida del gobernador, y así Dios me le
deje gozar, que me muero de hambre, y el negarme la comida, aunque le pese
al señor doctor y él más me diga, antes será quitarme la vida que
aumentármela.
— Vuestra merced tiene razón, señor gobernador —respondió el médico—; y así,
es mi parecer que vuestra merced no coma de aquellos conejos guisados que
allí están, porque es manjar peliagudo. De aquella ternera, si no fuera
asada y en adobo, aún se pudiera probar, pero no hay para qué.
Y Sancho dijo:
— Aquel platonazo que está más adelante vahando me parece que es olla
podrida, que por la diversidad de cosas que en las tales ollas podridas
hay, no podré dejar de topar con alguna que me sea de gusto y de provecho.
— Absit! —dijo el médico—. Vaya lejos de nosotros tan mal pensamiento: no
hay cosa en el mundo de peor mantenimiento que una olla podrida. Allá las
ollas podridas para los canónigos, o para los retores de colegios, o para
las bodas labradorescas, y déjennos libres las mesas de los gobernadores,
donde ha de asistir todo primor y toda atildadura; y la razón es porque
siempre y a doquiera y de quienquiera son más estimadas las medicinas
simples que las compuestas, porque en las simples no se puede errar y en
las compuestas sí, alterando la cantidad de las cosas de que son
compuestas; mas lo que yo sé que ha de comer el señor gobernador ahora,
para conservar su salud y corroborarla, es un ciento de cañutillos de
suplicaciones y unas tajadicas subtiles de carne de membrillo, que le
asienten el estómago y le ayuden a la digestión.
Oyendo esto Sancho, se arrimó sobre el espaldar de la silla y miró de hito
en hito al tal médico, y con voz grave le preguntó cómo se llamaba y dónde
había estudiado. A lo que él respondió:
— Yo, señor gobernador, me llamo el doctor Pedro Recio de Agüero, y soy
natural de un lugar llamado Tirteafuera, que está entre Caracuel y
Almodóvar del Campo, a la mano derecha, y tengo el grado de doctor por la
universidad de Osuna.
A lo que respondió Sancho, todo encendido en cólera:
— Pues, señor doctor Pedro Recio de Mal Agüero, natural de Tirteafuera,
lugar que está a la derecha mano como vamos de Caracuel a Almodóvar del
Campo, graduado en Osuna, quíteseme luego delante, si no, voto al sol que
tome un garrote y que a garrotazos, comenzando por él, no me ha de quedar
médico en toda la ínsula, a lo menos de aquellos que yo entienda que son
ignorantes; que a los médicos sabios, prudentes y discretos los pondré
sobre mi cabeza y los honraré como a personas divinas. Y vuelvo a decir que
se me vaya, Pedro Recio, de aquí; si no, tomaré esta silla donde estoy
sentado y se la estrellaré en la cabeza; y pídanmelo en residencia, que yo
me descargaré con decir que hice servicio a Dios en matar a un mal médico,
verdugo de la república. Y denme de comer, o si no, tómense su gobierno,
que oficio que no da de comer a su dueño no vale dos habas.
Alborotóse el doctor, viendo tan colérico al gobernador, y quiso hacer
tirteafuera de la sala, sino que en aquel instante sonó una corneta de
posta en la calle, y, asomándose el maestresala a la ventana, volvió
diciendo:
— Correo viene del duque mi señor; algún despacho debe de traer de
importancia.
Entró el correo sudando y asustado, y, sacando un pliego del seno, le puso
en las manos del gobernador, y Sancho le puso en las del mayordomo, a quien
mandó leyese el sobreescrito, que decía así: A don Sancho Panza, gobernador
de la ínsula Barataria, en su propia mano o en las de su secretario. Oyendo
lo cual, Sancho dijo:
— ¿Quién es aquí mi secretario?
Y uno de los que presentes estaban respondió:
— Yo, señor, porque sé leer y escribir, y soy vizcaíno.
— Con esa añadidura —dijo Sancho—, bien podéis ser secretario del mismo
emperador. Abrid ese pliego, y mirad lo que dice.
Hízolo así el recién nacido secretario, y, habiendo leído lo que decía,
dijo que era negocio para tratarle a solas. Mandó Sancho despejar la sala,
y que no quedasen en ella sino el mayordomo y el maestresala, y los demás y
el médico se fueron; y luego el secretario leyó la carta, que así decía:
A mi noticia ha llegado, señor don Sancho Panza, que unos enemigos míos y
desa ínsula la han de dar un asalto furioso, no sé qué noche; conviene
velar y estar alerta, porque no le tomen desapercebido. Sé también, por
espías verdaderas, que han entrado en ese lugar cuatro personas disfrazadas
para quitaros la vida, porque se temen de vuestro ingenio; abrid el ojo, y
mirad quién llega a hablaros, y no comáis de cosa que os presentaren. Yo
tendré cuidado de socorreros si os viéredes en trabajo, y en todo haréis
como se espera de vuestro entendimiento. Deste lugar, a 16 de agosto, a las
cuatro de la mañana.
Vuestro amigo,
El Duque.
Quedó atónito Sancho, y mostraron quedarlo asimismo los circunstantes; y,
volviéndose al mayordomo, le dijo:
— Lo que agora se ha de hacer, y ha de ser luego, es meter en un calabozo al
doctor Recio; porque si alguno me ha de matar, ha de ser él, y de muerte
adminícula y pésima, como es la de la hambre.
— También —dijo el maestresala— me parece a mí que vuesa merced no coma de
todo lo que está en esta mesa, porque lo han presentado unas monjas, y,
como suele decirse, detrás de la cruz está el diablo.
— No lo niego —respondió Sancho—, y por ahora denme un pedazo de pan y obra
de cuatro libras de uvas, que en ellas no podrá venir veneno; porque, en
efecto, no puedo pasar sin comer, y si es que hemos de estar prontos para
estas batallas que nos amenazan, menester será estar bien mantenidos,
porque tripas llevan corazón, que no corazón tripas. Y vos, secretario,
responded al duque mi señor y decidle que se cumplirá lo que manda como lo
manda, sin faltar punto; y daréis de mi parte un besamanos a mi señora la
duquesa, y que le suplico no se le olvide de enviar con un propio mi carta
y mi lío a mi mujer Teresa Panza, que en ello recibiré mucha merced, y
tendré cuidado de servirla con todo lo que mis fuerzas alcanzaren; y de
camino podéis encajar un besamanos a mi señor don Quijote de la Mancha,
porque vea que soy pan agradecido; y vos, como buen secretario y como buen
vizcaíno, podéis añadir todo lo que quisiéredes y más viniere a cuento. Y
álcense estos manteles, y denme a mí de comer, que yo me avendré con
cuantas espías y matadores y encantadores vinieren sobre mí y sobre mi
ínsula.
En esto entró un paje, y dijo:
— Aquí está un labrador negociante que quiere hablar a Vuestra Señoría en un
negocio, según él dice, de mucha importancia.
— Estraño caso es éste —dijo Sancho— destos negociantes. ¿Es posible que
sean tan necios, que no echen de ver que semejantes horas como éstas no son
en las que han de venir a negociar? ¿Por ventura los que gobernamos, los
que somos jueces, no somos hombres de carne y de hueso, y que es menester
que nos dejen descansar el tiempo que la necesidad pide, sino que quieren
que seamos hechos de piedra marmol? Por Dios y en mi conciencia que si me
dura el gobierno (que no durará, según se me trasluce), que yo ponga en
pretina a más de un negociante. Agora decid a ese buen hombre que entre;
pero adviértase primero no sea alguno de los espías, o matador mío.
— No, señor —respondió el paje—, porque parece una alma de cántaro, y yo sé
poco, o él es tan bueno como el buen pan.
— No hay que temer —dijo el mayordomo—, que aquí estamos todos.
— ¿Sería posible —dijo Sancho—, maestresala, que agora que no está aquí el
doctor Pedro Recio, que comiese yo alguna cosa de peso y de sustancia,
aunque fuese un pedazo de pan y una cebolla?
— Esta noche, a la cena, se satisfará la falta de la comida, y quedará
Vuestra Señoría satisfecho y pagado —dijo el maestresala.
— Dios lo haga —respondió Sancho.
Y, en esto, entró el labrador, que era de muy buena presencia, y de mil
leguas se le echaba de ver que era bueno y buena alma. Lo primero que dijo
fue:
— ¿Quién es aquí el señor gobernador?
— ¿Quién ha de ser —respondió el secretario—, sino el que está sentado en la
silla?
— Humíllome, pues, a su presencia —dijo el labrador.
Y, poniéndose de rodillas, le pidió la mano para besársela. Negósela
Sancho, y mandó que se levantase y dijese lo que quisiese. Hízolo así el
labrador, y luego dijo:
— Yo, señor, soy labrador, natural de Miguel Turra, un lugar que está dos
leguas de Ciudad Real.
— ¡Otro Tirteafuera tenemos! —dijo Sancho—. Decid, hermano, que lo que yo os
sé decir es que sé muy bien a Miguel Turra, y que no está muy lejos de mi
pueblo.
— Es, pues, el caso, señor —prosiguió el labrador—, que yo, por la
misericordia de Dios, soy casado en paz y en haz de la Santa Iglesia
Católica Romana; tengo dos hijos estudiantes que el menor estudia para
bachiller y el mayor para licenciado; soy viudo, porque se murió mi mujer,
o, por mejor decir, me la mató un mal médico, que la purgó estando preñada,
y si Dios fuera servido que saliera a luz el parto, y fuera hijo, yo le
pusiere a estudiar para doctor, porque no tuviera invidia a sus hermanos el
bachiller y el licenciado.
— De modo —dijo Sancho— que si vuestra mujer no se hubiera muerto, o la
hubieran muerto, vos no fuérades agora viudo.
— No, señor, en ninguna manera —respondió el labrador.
— ¡Medrados estamos! —replicó Sancho—. Adelante, hermano, que es hora de
dormir más que de negociar.
— Digo, pues —dijo el labrador—, que este mi hijo que ha de ser bachiller se
enamoró en el mesmo pueblo de una doncella llamada Clara Perlerina, hija de
Andrés Perlerino, labrador riquísimo; y este nombre de Perlerines no les
viene de abolengo ni otra alcurnia, sino porque todos los deste linaje son
perláticos, y por mejorar el nombre los llaman Perlerines; aunque, si va
decir la verdad, la doncella es como una perla oriental, y, mirada por el
lado derecho, parece una flor del campo; por el izquierdo no tanto, porque
le falta aquel ojo, que se le saltó de viruelas; y, aunque los hoyos del
rostro son muchos y grandes, dicen los que la quieren bien que aquéllos no
son hoyos, sino sepulturas donde se sepultan las almas de sus amantes. Es
tan limpia que, por no ensuciar la cara, trae las narices, como dicen,
arremangadas, que no parece sino que van huyendo de la boca; y, con todo
esto, parece bien por estremo, porque tiene la boca grande, y, a no
faltarle diez o doce dientes y muelas, pudiera pasar y echar raya entre las
más bien formadas. De los labios no tengo qué decir, porque son tan sutiles
y delicados que, si se usaran aspar labios, pudieran hacer dellos una
madeja; pero, como tienen diferente color de la que en los labios se usa
comúnmente, parecen milagrosos, porque son jaspeados de azul y verde y
aberenjenado; y perdóneme el señor gobernador si por tan menudo voy
pintando las partes de la que al fin al fin ha de ser mi hija, que la
quiero bien y no me parece mal.
— Pintad lo que quisiéredes —dijo Sancho—, que yo me voy recreando en la
pintura, y si hubiera comido, no hubiera mejor postre para mí que vuestro
retrato.
— Eso tengo yo por servir —respondió el labrador—, pero tiempo vendrá en que
seamos, si ahora no somos. Y digo, señor, que si pudiera pintar su
gentileza y la altura de su cuerpo, fuera cosa de admiración; pero no puede
ser, a causa de que ella está agobiada y encogida, y tiene las rodillas con
la boca, y, con todo eso, se echa bien de ver que si se pudiera levantar,
diera con la cabeza en el techo; y ya ella hubiera dado la mano de esposa a
mi bachiller, sino que no la puede estender, que está añudada; y, con todo,
en las uñas largas y acanaladas se muestra su bondad y buena hechura.
— Está bien —dijo Sancho—, y haced cuenta, hermano, que ya la habéis pintado
de los pies a la cabeza. ¿Qué es lo que queréis ahora? Y venid al punto sin
rodeos ni callejuelas, ni retazos ni añadiduras.
— Querría, señor —respondió el labrador—, que vuestra merced me hiciese
merced de darme una carta de favor para mi consuegro, suplicándole sea
servido de que este casamiento se haga, pues no somos desiguales en los
bienes de fortuna, ni en los de la naturaleza; porque, para decir la
verdad, señor gobernador, mi hijo es endemoniado, y no hay día que tres o
cuatro veces no le atormenten los malignos espíritus; y de haber caído una
vez en el fuego, tiene el rostro arrugado como pergamino, y los ojos algo
llorosos y manantiales; pero tiene una condición de un ángel, y si no es
que se aporrea y se da de puñadas él mesmo a sí mesmo, fuera un bendito.
— ¿Queréis otra cosa, buen hombre? —replicó Sancho.
— Otra cosa querría —dijo el labrador—, sino que no me atrevo a decirlo;
pero vaya, que, en fin, no se me ha de podrir en el pecho, pegue o no
pegue. Digo, señor, que querría que vuesa merced me diese trecientos o
seiscientos ducados para ayuda a la dote de mi bachiller; digo para ayuda
de poner su casa, porque, en fin, han de vivir por sí, sin estar sujetos a
las impertinencias de los suegros.
— Mirad si queréis otra cosa —dijo Sancho—, y no la dejéis de decir por
empacho ni por vergüenza.
— No, por cierto —respondió el labrador.
Y, apenas dijo esto, cuando, levantándose en pie el gobernador, asió de la
silla en que estaba sentado y dijo:
— ¡Voto a tal, don patán rústico y mal mirado, que si no os apartáis y
ascondéis luego de mi presencia, que con esta silla os rompa y abra la
cabeza! Hideputa bellaco, pintor del mesmo demonio, ¿y a estas horas te
vienes a pedirme seiscientos ducados?; y ¿dónde los tengo yo, hediondo?; y
¿por qué te los había de dar, aunque los tuviera, socarrón y mentecato?; y
¿qué se me da a mí de Miguel Turra, ni de todo el linaje de los Perlerines?
¡Va de mí, digo; si no, por vida del duque mi señor, que haga lo que tengo
dicho! Tú no debes de ser de Miguel Turra, sino algún socarrón que, para
tentarme, te ha enviado aquí el infierno. Dime, desalmado, aún no ha día y
medio que tengo el gobierno, y ¿ya quieres que tenga seiscientos ducados?
Hizo de señas el maestresala al labrador que se saliese de la sala, el cual
lo hizo cabizbajo y, al parecer, temeroso de que el gobernador no ejecutase
su cólera, que el bellacón supo hacer muy bien su oficio.
Pero dejemos con su cólera a Sancho, y ándese la paz en el corro, y
volvamos a don Quijote, que le dejamos vendado el rostro y curado de las
gatescas heridas, de las cuales no sanó en ocho días, en uno de los cuales
le sucedió lo que Cide Hamete promete de contar con la puntualidad y
verdad que suele contar las cosas desta historia, por mínimas que sean.
Capítulo XLVIII. De lo que le sucedió a don Quijote con doña Rodríguez, la
dueña de la duquesa, con otros acontecimientos dignos de escritura y de
memoria eterna
Además estaba mohíno y malencólico el mal ferido don Quijote, vendado el
rostro y señalado, no por la mano de Dios, sino por las uñas de un gato,
desdichas anejas a la andante caballería. Seis días estuvo sin salir en
público, en una noche de las cuales, estando despierto y desvelado,
pensando en sus desgracias y en el perseguimiento de Altisidora, sintió que
con una llave abrían la puerta de su aposento, y luego imaginó que la
enamorada doncella venía para sobresaltar su honestidad y ponerle en
condición de faltar a la fee que guardar debía a su señora Dulcinea del
Toboso.
— No —dijo creyendo a su imaginación, y esto, con voz que pudiera ser oída—;
no ha de ser parte la mayor hermosura de la tierra para que yo deje de
adorar la que tengo grabada y estampada en la mitad de mi corazón y en lo
más escondido de mis entrañas, ora estés, señora mía, transformada en
cebolluda labradora, ora en ninfa del dorado Tajo, tejiendo telas de oro y
sirgo compuestas, ora te tenga Merlín, o Montesinos, donde ellos quisieren;
que, adondequiera eres mía, y adoquiera he sido yo, y he de ser, tuyo.
El acabar estas razones y el abrir de la puerta fue todo uno. Púsose en pie
sobre la cama, envuelto de arriba abajo en una colcha de raso amarillo, una
galocha en la cabeza, y el rostro y los bigotes vendados: el rostro, por
los aruños; los bigotes, porque no se le desmayasen y cayesen; en el cual
traje parecía la más extraordinaria fantasma que se pudiera pensar.
Clavó los ojos en la puerta, y, cuando esperaba ver entrar por ella a la
rendida y lastimada Altisidora, vio entrar a una reverendísima dueña con
unas tocas blancas repulgadas y luengas, tanto, que la cubrían y enmantaban
desde los pies a la cabeza. Entre los dedos de la mano izquierda traía una
media vela encendida, y con la derecha se hacía sombra, porque no le diese
la luz en los ojos, a quien cubrían unos muy grandes antojos. Venía pisando
quedito, y movía los pies blandamente.
Miróla don Quijote desde su atalaya, y cuando vio su adeliño y notó su
silencio, pensó que alguna bruja o maga venía en aquel traje a hacer en él
alguna mala fechuría, y comenzó a santiguarse con mucha priesa. Fuese
llegando la visión, y, cuando llegó a la mitad del aposento, alzó los ojos
y vio la priesa con que se estaba haciendo cruces don Quijote; y si él
quedó medroso en ver tal figura, ella quedó espantada en ver la suya,
porque, así como le vio tan alto y tan amarillo, con la colcha y con las
vendas, que le desfiguraban, dio una gran voz, diciendo:
— ¡Jesús! ¿Qué es lo que veo?
Y con el sobresalto se le cayó la vela de las manos; y, viéndose a escuras,
volvió las espaldas para irse, y con el miedo tropezó en sus faldas y dio
consigo una gran caída. Don Quijote, temeroso, comenzó a decir:
— Conjúrote, fantasma, o lo que eres, que me digas quién eres, y que me
digas qué es lo que de mí quieres. Si eres alma en pena, dímelo, que yo
haré por ti todo cuanto mis fuerzas alcanzaren, porque soy católico
cristiano y amigo de hacer bien a todo el mundo; que para esto tomé la
orden de la caballería andante que profeso, cuyo ejercicio aun hasta hacer
bien a las ánimas de purgatorio se estiende.
La brumada dueña, que oyó conjurarse, por su temor coligió el de don
Quijote, y con voz afligida y baja le respondió:
— Señor don Quijote, si es que acaso vuestra merced es don Quijote, yo no
soy fantasma, ni visión, ni alma de purgatorio, como vuestra merced debe de
haber pensado, sino doña Rodríguez, la dueña de honor de mi señora la
duquesa, que, con una necesidad de aquellas que vuestra merced suele
remediar, a vuestra merced vengo.
— Dígame, señora doña Rodríguez —dijo don Quijote—: ¿por ventura viene
vuestra merced a hacer alguna tercería? Porque le hago saber que no soy de
provecho para nadie, merced a la sin par belleza de mi señora Dulcinea del
Toboso. Digo, en fin, señora doña Rodríguez, que, como vuestra merced salve
y deje a una parte todo recado amoroso, puede volver a encender su vela, y
vuelva, y departiremos de todo lo que más mandare y más en gusto le
viniere, salvando, como digo, todo incitativo melindre.
— ¿Yo recado de nadie, señor mío? —respondió la dueña—. Mal me conoce
vuestra merced; sí, que aún no estoy en edad tan prolongada que me acoja a
semejantes niñerías, pues, Dios loado, mi alma me tengo en las carnes, y
todos mis dientes y muelas en la boca, amén de unos pocos que me han
usurpado unos catarros, que en esta tierra de Aragón son tan ordinarios.
Pero espéreme vuestra merced un poco; saldré a encender mi vela, y volveré
en un instante a contar mis cuitas, como a remediador de todas las del
mundo.
Y, sin esperar respuesta, se salió del aposento, donde quedó don Quijote
sosegado y pensativo esperándola; pero luego le sobrevinieron mil
pensamientos acerca de aquella nueva aventura, y parecíale ser mal hecho y
peor pensado ponerse en peligro de romper a su señora la fee prometida, y
decíase a sí mismo:
— ¿Quién sabe si el diablo, que es sutil y mañoso, querrá engañarme agora
con una dueña, lo que no ha podido con emperatrices, reinas, duquesas,
marquesas ni condesas? Que yo he oído decir muchas veces y a muchos
discretos que, si él puede, antes os la dará roma que aguileña. Y ¿quién
sabe si esta soledad, esta ocasión y este silencio despertará mis deseos
que duermen, y harán que al cabo de mis años venga a caer donde nunca he
tropezado? Y, en casos semejantes, mejor es huir que esperar la batalla.
Pero yo no debo de estar en mi juicio, pues tales disparates digo y pienso;
que no es posible que una dueña toquiblanca, larga y antojuna pueda mover
ni levantar pensamiento lascivo en el más desalmado pecho del mundo. ¿Por
ventura hay dueña en la tierra que tenga buenas carnes? ¿Por ventura hay
dueña en el orbe que deje de ser impertinente, fruncida y melindrosa?
¡Afuera, pues, caterva dueñesca, inútil para ningún humano regalo! ¡Oh,
cuán bien hacía aquella señora de quien se dice que tenía dos dueñas de
bulto con sus antojos y almohadillas al cabo de su estrado, como que
estaban labrando, y tanto le servían para la autoridad de la sala aquellas
estatuas como las dueñas verdaderas!
Y, diciendo esto, se arrojó del lecho, con intención de cerrar la puerta y
no dejar entrar a la señora Rodríguez; mas, cuando la llegó a cerrar, ya la
señora Rodríguez volvía, encendida una vela de cera blanca, y cuando ella
vio a don Quijote de más cerca, envuelto en la colcha, con las vendas,
galocha o becoquín, temió de nuevo, y, retirándose atrás como dos pasos,
dijo:
— ¿Estamos seguras, señor caballero? Porque no tengo a muy honesta señal
haberse vuesa merced levantado de su lecho.
— Eso mesmo es bien que yo pregunte, señora —respondió don Quijote—; y así,
pregunto si estaré yo seguro de ser acometido y forzado.
— ¿De quién o a quién pedís, señor caballero, esa seguridad? —respondió la
dueña.
— A vos y de vos la pido —replicó don Quijote—, porque ni yo soy de mármol
ni vos de bronce, ni ahora son las diez del día, sino media noche, y aun un
poco más, según imagino, y en una estancia más cerrada y secreta que lo
debió de ser la cueva donde el traidor y atrevido Eneas gozó a la hermosa y
piadosa Dido. Pero dadme, señora, la mano, que yo no quiero otra seguridad
mayor que la de mi continencia y recato, y la que ofrecen esas
reverendísimas tocas.
Y, diciendo esto, besó su derecha mano, y le asió de la suya, que ella le
dio con las mesmas ceremonias.
Aquí hace Cide Hamete un paréntesis, y dice que por Mahoma que diera, por
ver ir a los dos así asidos y trabados desde la puerta al lecho, la mejor
almalafa de dos que tenía.
Entróse, en fin, don Quijote en su lecho, y quedóse doña Rodríguez sentada
en una silla, algo desviada de la cama, no quitándose los antojos ni la
vela. Don Quijote se acorrucó y se cubrió todo, no dejando más de el rostro
descubierto; y, habiéndose los dos sosegado, el primero que rompió el
silencio fue don Quijote, diciendo:
— Puede vuesa merced ahora, mi señora doña Rodríguez, descoserse y desbuchar
todo aquello que tiene dentro de su cuitado corazón y lastimadas entrañas,
que será de mí escuchada con castos oídos, y socorrida con piadosas obras.
— Así lo creo yo —respondió la dueña—, que de la gentil y agradable
presencia de vuesa merced no se podía esperar sino tan cristiana respuesta.
«Es, pues, el caso, señor don Quijote, que, aunque vuesa merced me vee
sentada en esta silla y en la mitad del reino de Aragón, y en hábito de
dueña aniquilada y asendereada, soy natural de las Asturias de Oviedo, y de
linaje que atraviesan por él muchos de los mejores de aquella provincia;
pero mi corta suerte y el descuido de mis padres, que empobrecieron antes
de tiempo, sin saber cómo ni cómo no, me trujeron a la corte, a Madrid,
donde por bien de paz y por escusar mayores desventuras, mis padres me
acomodaron a servir de doncella de labor a una principal señora; y quiero
hacer sabidor a vuesa merced que en hacer vainillas y labor blanca ninguna
me ha echado el pie adelante en toda la vida. Mis padres me dejaron
sirviendo y se volvieron a su tierra, y de allí a pocos años se debieron de
ir al cielo, porque eran además buenos y católicos cristianos. Quedé
huérfana, y atenida al miserable salario y a las angustiadas mercedes que
a las tales criadas se suele dar en palacio; y, en este tiempo, sin que
diese yo ocasión a ello, se enamoró de mi un escudero de casa, hombre ya en
días, barbudo y apersonado, y, sobre todo, hidalgo como el rey, porque era
montañés. No tratamos tan secretamente nuestros amores que no viniesen a
noticia de mi señora, la cual, por escusar dimes y diretes, nos casó en paz
y en haz de la Santa Madre Iglesia Católica Romana, de cuyo matrimonio
nació una hija para rematar con mi ventura, si alguna tenía; no porque yo
muriese del parto, que le tuve derecho y en sazón, sino porque desde allí a
poco murió mi esposo de un cierto espanto que tuvo, que, a tener ahora
lugar para contarle, yo sé que vuestra merced se admirara.»
Y, en esto, comenzó a llorar tiernamente, y dijo:
— Perdóneme vuestra merced, señor don Quijote, que no va más en mi mano,
porque todas las veces que me acuerdo de mi mal logrado se me arrasan los
ojos de lágrimas. ¡Válame Dios, y con qué autoridad llevaba a mi señora a
las ancas de una poderosa mula, negra como el mismo azabache! Que entonces
no se usaban coches ni sillas, como agora dicen que se usan, y las señoras
iban a las ancas de sus escuderos. Esto, a lo menos, no puedo dejar de
contarlo, porque se note la crianza y puntualidad de mi buen marido. «Al
entrar de la calle de Santiago, en Madrid, que es algo estrecha, venía a
salir por ella un alcalde de corte con dos alguaciles delante, y, así como
mi buen escudero le vio, volvió las riendas a la mula, dando señal de
volver a acompañarle. Mi señora, que iba a las ancas, con voz baja le
decía: ''—¿Qué hacéis, desventurado? ¿No veis que voy aquí?'' El alcalde,
de comedido, detuvo la rienda al caballo y díjole: ''—Seguid, señor,
vuestro camino, que yo soy el que debo acompañar a mi señora doña
Casilda'', que así era el nombre de mi ama. Todavía porfiaba mi marido, con
la gorra en la mano, a querer ir acompañando al alcalde, viendo lo cual mi
señora, llena de cólera y enojo, sacó un alfiler gordo, o creo que un
punzón, del estuche, y clavósele por los lomos, de manera que mi marido dio
una gran voz y torció el cuerpo, de suerte que dio con su señora en el
suelo. Acudieron dos lacayos suyos a levantarla, y lo mismo hizo el alcalde
y los alguaciles; alborotóse la Puerta de Guadalajara, digo, la gente
baldía que en ella estaba; vínose a pie mi ama, y mi marido acudió en casa
de un barbero diciendo que llevaba pasadas de parte a parte las entrañas.
Divulgóse la cortesía de mi esposo, tanto, que los muchachos le corrían por
las calles, y por esto y porque él era algún tanto corto de vista, mi
señora la duquesa le despidió, de cuyo pesar, sin duda alguna, tengo para
mí que se le causó el mal de la muerte. Quedé yo viuda y desamparada, y con
hija a cuestas, que iba creciendo en hermosura como la espuma de la mar.
Finalmente, como yo tuviese fama de gran labrandera, mi señora la duquesa,
que estaba recién casada con el duque mi señor, quiso traerme consigo a
este reino de Aragón y a mi hija ni más ni menos, adonde, yendo días y
viniendo días, creció mi hija, y con ella todo el donaire del mundo: canta
como una calandria, danza como el pensamiento, baila como una perdida, lee
y escribe como un maestro de escuela, y cuenta como un avariento. De su
limpieza no digo nada: que el agua que corre no es más limpia, y debe de
tener agora, si mal no me acuerdo, diez y seis años, cinco meses y tres
días, uno más a menos. En resolución: de esta mi muchacha se enamoró un
hijo de un labrador riquísimo que está en una aldea del duque mi señor, no
muy lejos de aquí. En efecto, no sé cómo ni cómo no, ellos se juntaron, y,
debajo de la palabra de ser su esposo, burló a mi hija, y no se la quiere
cumplir; y, aunque el duque mi señor lo sabe, porque yo me he quejado a él,
no una, sino muchas veces, y pedídole mande que el tal labrador se case con
mi hija, hace orejas de mercader y apenas quiere oírme; y es la causa que,
como el padre del burlador es tan rico y le presta dineros, y le sale por
fiador de sus trampas por momentos, no le quiere descontentar ni dar
pesadumbre en ningún modo.» Querría, pues, señor mío, que vuesa merced
tomase a cargo el deshacer este agravio, o ya por ruegos, o ya por armas,
pues, según todo el mundo dice, vuesa merced nació en él para deshacerlos y
para enderezar los tuertos y amparar los miserables; y póngasele a vuesa
merced por delante la orfandad de mi hija, su gentileza, su mocedad, con
todas las buenas partes que he dicho que tiene; que en Dios y en mi
conciencia que de cuantas doncellas tiene mi señora, que no hay ninguna que
llegue a la suela de su zapato, y que una que llaman Altisidora, que es la
que tienen por más desenvuelta y gallarda, puesta en comparación de mi
hija, no la llega con dos leguas. Porque quiero que sepa vuesa merced,
señor mío, que no es todo oro lo que reluce; porque esta Altisidorilla
tiene más de presunción que de hermosura, y más de desenvuelta que de
recogida, además que no está muy sana: que tiene un cierto allento cansado,
que no hay sufrir el estar junto a ella un momento. Y aun mi señora la
duquesa... Quiero callar, que se suele decir que las paredes tienen oídos.
— ¿Qué tiene mi señora la duquesa, por vida mía, señora doña Rodríguez?
— preguntó don Quijote.
— Con ese conjuro —respondió la dueña—, no puedo dejar de responder a lo que
se me pregunta con toda verdad. ¿Vee vuesa merced, señor don Quijote, la
hermosura de mi señora la duquesa, aquella tez de rostro, que no parece
sino de una espada acicalada y tersa, aquellas dos mejillas de leche y de
carmín, que en la una tiene el sol y en la otra la luna, y aquella
gallardía con que va pisando y aun despreciando el suelo, que no parece
sino que va derramando salud donde pasa? Pues sepa vuesa merced que lo
puede agradecer, primero, a Dios, y luego, a dos fuentes que tiene en las
dos piernas, por donde se desagua todo el mal humor de quien dicen los
médicos que está llena.
— ¡Santa María! —dijo don Quijote—. Y ¿es posible que mi señora la duquesa
tenga tales desaguaderos? No lo creyera si me lo dijeran frailes descalzos;
pero, pues la señora doña Rodríguez lo dice, debe de ser así. Pero tales
fuentes, y en tales lugares, no deben de manar humor, sino ámbar líquido.
Verdaderamente que ahora acabo de creer que esto de hacerse fuentes debe de
ser cosa importante para salud.
Apenas acabó don Quijote de decir esta razón, cuando con un gran golpe
abrieron las puertas del aposento, y del sobresalto del golpe se le cayó a
doña Rodríguez la vela de la mano, y quedó la estancia como boca de lobo,
como suele decirse. Luego sintió la pobre dueña que la asían de la garganta
con dos manos, tan fuertemente que no la dejaban gañir, y que otra persona,
con mucha presteza, sin hablar palabra, le alzaba las faldas, y con una, al
parecer, chinela, le comenzó a dar tantos azotes, que era una compasión; y,
aunque don Quijote se la tenía, no se meneaba del lecho, y no sabía qué
podía ser aquello, y estábase quedo y callando, y aun temiendo no viniese
por él la tanda y tunda azotesca. Y no fue vano su temor, porque, en
dejando molida a la dueña los callados verdugos (la cual no osaba
quejarse), acudieron a don Quijote, y, desenvolviéndole de la sábana y de
la colcha, le pellizcaron tan a menudo y tan reciamente, que no pudo dejar
de defenderse a puñadas, y todo esto en silencio admirable. Duró la batalla
casi media hora; saliéronse las fantasmas, recogió doña Rodríguez sus
faldas, y, gimiendo su desgracia, se salió por la puerta afuera, sin decir
palabra a don Quijote, el cual, doloroso y pellizcado, confuso y pensativo,
se quedó solo, donde le dejaremos deseoso de saber quién había sido el
perverso encantador que tal le había puesto. Pero ello se dirá a su tiempo,
que Sancho Panza nos llama, y el buen concierto de la historia lo pide.
Capítulo XLIX. De lo que le sucedió a Sancho Panza rondando su ínsula
Dejamos al gran gobernador enojado y mohíno con el labrador pintor y
socarrón, el cual, industriado del mayordomo, y el mayordomo del duque, se
burlaban de Sancho; pero él se las tenía tiesas a todos, maguera tonto,
bronco y rollizo, y dijo a los que con él estaban, y al doctor Pedro Recio,
que, como se acabó el secreto de la carta del duque, había vuelto a entrar
en la sala:
— Ahora verdaderamente que entiendo que los jueces y gobernadores deben de
ser, o han de ser, de bronce, para no sentir las importunidades de los
negociantes, que a todas horas y a todos tiempos quieren que los escuchen y
despachen, atendiendo sólo a su negocio, venga lo que viniere; y si el
pobre del juez no los escucha y despacha, o porque no puede o porque no es
aquél el tiempo diputado para darles audiencia, luego les maldicen y
murmuran, y les roen los huesos, y aun les deslindan los linajes.
Negociante necio, negociante mentecato, no te apresures; espera sazón y
coyuntura para negociar: no vengas a la hora del comer ni a la del dormir,
que los jueces son de carne y de hueso y han de dar a la naturaleza lo que
naturalmente les pide, si no es yo, que no le doy de comer a la mía, merced
al señor doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera, que está delante, que quiere que
muera de hambre, y afirma que esta muerte es vida, que así se la dé Dios a
él y a todos los de su ralea: digo, a la de los malos médicos, que la de
los buenos, palmas y lauros merecen.
Todos los que conocían a Sancho Panza se admiraban, oyéndole hablar tan
elegantemente, y no sabían a qué atribuirlo, sino a que los oficios y
cargos graves, o adoban o entorpecen los entendimientos. Finalmente, el
doctor Pedro Recio Agüero de Tirteafuera prometió de darle de cenar aquella
noche, aunque excediese de todos los aforismos de Hipócrates. Con esto
quedó contento el gobernador, y esperaba con grande ansia llegase la noche
y la hora de cenar; y, aunque el tiempo, al parecer suyo, se estaba quedo,
sin moverse de un lugar, todavía se llegó por él el tanto deseado, donde
le dieron de cenar un salpicón de vaca con cebolla, y unas manos cocidas de
ternera algo entrada en días. Entregóse en todo con más gusto que si le
hubieran dado francolines de Milán, faisanes de Roma, ternera de Sorrento,
perdices de Morón, o gansos de Lavajos; y, entre la cena, volviéndose al
doctor, le dijo:
— Mirad, señor doctor: de aquí adelante no os curéis de darme a comer cosas
regaladas ni manjares esquisitos, porque será sacar a mi estómago de sus
quicios, el cual está acostumbrado a cabra, a vaca, a tocino, a cecina, a
nabos y a cebollas; y, si acaso le dan otros manjares de palacio, los
recibe con melindre, y algunas veces con asco. Lo que el maestresala puede
hacer es traerme estas que llaman ollas podridas, que mientras más podridas
son, mejor huelen, y en ellas puede embaular y encerrar todo lo que él
quisiere, como sea de comer, que yo se lo agradeceré y se lo pagaré algún
día; y no se burle nadie conmigo, porque o somos o no somos: vivamos todos
y comamos en buena paz compaña, pues, cuando Dios amanece, para todos
amanece. Yo gobernaré esta ínsula sin perdonar derecho ni llevar cohecho, y
todo el mundo traiga el ojo alerta y mire por el virote, porque les hago
saber que el diablo está en Cantillana, y que, si me dan ocasión, han de
ver maravillas. No, sino haceos miel, y comeros han moscas.
— Por cierto, señor gobernador —dijo el maestresala—, que vuesa merced tiene
mucha razón en cuanto ha dicho, y que yo ofrezco en nombre de todos los
insulanos desta ínsula que han de servir a vuestra merced con toda
puntualidad, amor y benevolencia, porque el suave modo de gobernar que en
estos principios vuesa merced ha dado no les da lugar de hacer ni de pensar
cosa que en deservicio de vuesa merced redunde.
— Yo lo creo —respondió Sancho—, y serían ellos unos necios si otra cosa
hiciesen o pensasen. Y vuelvo a decir que se tenga cuenta con mi sustento y
con el de mi rucio, que es lo que en este negocio importa y hace más al
caso; y, en siendo hora, vamos a rondar, que es mi intención limpiar esta
ínsula de todo género de inmundicia y de gente vagamunda, holgazanes, y mal
entretenida; porque quiero que sepáis, amigos, que la gente baldía y
perezosa es en la república lo mesmo que los zánganos en las colmenas, que
se comen la miel que las trabajadoras abejas hacen. Pienso favorecer a los
labradores, guardar sus preeminencias a los hidalgos, premiar los virtuosos
y, sobre todo, tener respeto a la religión y a la honra de los religiosos.
¿Qué os parece desto, amigos? ¿Digo algo, o quiébrome la cabeza?
— Dice tanto vuesa merced, señor gobernador —dijo el mayordomo—, que estoy
admirado de ver que un hombre tan sin letras como vuesa merced, que, a lo
que creo, no tiene ninguna, diga tales y tantas cosas llenas de sentencias
y de avisos, tan fuera de todo aquello que del ingenio de vuesa merced
esperaban los que nos enviaron y los que aquí venimos. Cada día se veen
cosas nuevas en el mundo: las burlas se vuelven en veras y los burladores
se hallan burlados.
Llegó la noche, y cenó el gobernador, con licencia del señor doctor Recio.
Aderezáronse de ronda; salió con el mayordomo, secretario y maestresala, y
el coronista que tenía cuidado de poner en memoria sus hechos, y alguaciles
y escribanos, tantos que podían formar un mediano escuadrón. Iba Sancho en
medio, con su vara, que no había más que ver, y pocas calles andadas del
lugar, sintieron ruido de cuchilladas; acudieron allá, y hallaron que eran
dos solos hombres los que reñían, los cuales, viendo venir a la justicia,
se estuvieron quedos; y el uno dellos dijo:
— ¡Aquí de Dios y del rey! ¿Cómo y que se ha de sufrir que roben en poblado
en este pueblo, y que salga a saltear en él en la mitad de las calles?
— Sosegaos, hombre de bien —dijo Sancho—, y contadme qué es la causa desta
pendencia, que yo soy el gobernador.
El otro contrario dijo:
— Señor gobernador, yo la diré con toda brevedad. Vuestra merced sabrá que
este gentilhombre acaba de ganar ahora en esta casa de juego que está aquí
frontero más de mil reales, y sabe Dios cómo; y, hallándome yo presente,
juzgué más de una suerte dudosa en su favor, contra todo aquello que me
dictaba la conciencia; alzóse con la ganancia, y, cuando esperaba que me
había de dar algún escudo, por lo menos, de barato, como es uso y costumbre
darle a los hombres principales como yo, que estamos asistentes para bien y
mal pasar, y para apoyar sinrazones y evitar pendencias, él embolsó su
dinero y se salió de la casa. Yo vine despechado tras él, y con buenas y
corteses palabras le he pedido que me diese siquiera ocho reales, pues sabe
que yo soy hombre honrado y que no tengo oficio ni beneficio, porque mis
padres no me le enseñaron ni me le dejaron, y el socarrón, que no es más
ladrón que Caco, ni más fullero que Andradilla, no quería darme más de
cuatro reales; ¡porque vea vuestra merced, señor gobernador, qué poca
vergüenza y qué poca conciencia! Pero a fee que, si vuesa merced no
llegara, que yo le hiciera vomitar la ganancia, y que había de saber con
cuántas entraba la romana.
— ¿Qué decís vos a esto? —preguntó Sancho.
Y el otro respondió que era verdad cuanto su contrario decía, y no había
querido darle más de cuatro reales porque se los daba muchas veces; y los
que esperan barato han de ser comedidos y tomar con rostro alegre lo que
les dieren, sin ponerse en cuentas con los gananciosos, si ya no supiesen
de cierto que son fulleros y que lo que ganan es mal ganado; y que, para
señal que él era hombre de bien y no ladrón, como decía, ninguna había
mayor que el no haberle querido dar nada; que siempre los fulleros son
tributarios de los mirones que los conocen.
— Así es —dijo el mayordomo—. Vea vuestra merced, señor gobernador, qué es
lo que se ha de hacer destos hombres.
— Lo que se ha de hacer es esto —respondió Sancho—: vos, ganancioso, bueno,
o malo, o indiferente, dad luego a este vuestro acuchillador cien reales, y
más, habéis de desembolsar treinta para los pobres de la cárcel; y vos, que
no tenéis oficio ni beneficio y andáis de nones en esta ínsula, tomad luego
esos cien reales, y mañana en todo el día salid desta ínsula desterrado por
diez años, so pena, si lo quebrantáredes, los cumpláis en la otra vida,
colgándoos yo de una picota, o, a lo menos, el verdugo por mi mandado; y
ninguno me replique, que le asentaré la mano.
Desembolsó el uno, recibió el otro, éste se salió de la ínsula, y aquél se
fue a su casa, y el gobernador quedó diciendo:
— Ahora, yo podré poco, o quitaré estas casas de juego, que a mí se me
trasluce que son muy perjudiciales.
— Ésta, a lo menos —dijo un escribano—, no la podrá vuesa merced quitar,
porque la tiene un gran personaje, y más es sin comparación lo que él
pierde al año que lo que saca de los naipes. Contra otros garitos de menor
cantía podrá vuestra merced mostrar su poder, que son los que más daño
hacen y más insolencias encubren; que en las casas de los caballeros
principales y de los señores no se atreven los famosos fulleros a usar de
sus tretas; y, pues el vicio del juego se ha vuelto en ejercicio común,
mejor es que se juegue en casas principales que no en la de algún oficial,
donde cogen a un desdichado de media noche abajo y le desuellan vivo.
— Agora, escribano —dijo Sancho—, yo sé que hay mucho que decir en eso.
Y, en esto, llegó un corchete que traía asido a un mozo, y dijo:
— Señor gobernador, este mancebo venía hacia nosotros, y, así como columbró
la justicia, volvió las espaldas y comenzó a correr como un gamo, señal que
debe de ser algún delincuente. Yo partí tras él, y, si no fuera porque
tropezó y cayó, no le alcanzara jamás.
— ¿Por qué huías, hombre? —preguntó Sancho.
A lo que el mozo respondió:
— Señor, por escusar de responder a las muchas preguntas que las justicias
hacen.
— ¿Qué oficio tienes?
— Tejedor.
— ¿Y qué tejes?
— Hierros de lanzas, con licencia buena de vuestra merced.
— ¿Graciosico me sois? ¿De chocarrero os picáis? ¡Está bien! Y ¿adónde
íbades ahora?
— Señor, a tomar el aire.
— Y ¿adónde se toma el aire en esta ínsula?
— Adonde sopla.
— ¡Bueno: respondéis muy a propósito! Discreto sois, mancebo; pero haced
cuenta que yo soy el aire, y que os soplo en popa, y os encamino a la
cárcel. ¡Asilde, hola, y llevadle, que yo haré que duerma allí sin aire
esta noche!
— ¡Par Dios —dijo el mozo—, así me haga vuestra merced dormir en la cárcel
como hacerme rey!
— Pues, ¿por qué no te haré yo dormir en la cárcel? —respondió Sancho—. ¿No
tengo yo poder para prenderte y soltarte cada y cuando que quisiere?
— Por más poder que vuestra merced tenga —dijo el mozo—, no será bastante
para hacerme dormir en la cárcel.
— ¿Cómo que no? —replicó Sancho—. Llevalde luego donde verá por sus ojos el
desengaño, aunque más el alcaide quiera usar con él de su interesal
liberalidad; que yo le pondré pena de dos mil ducados si te deja salir un
paso de la cárcel.
— Todo eso es cosa de risa —respondió el mozo—. El caso es que no me harán
dormir en la cárcel cuantos hoy viven.
— Dime, demonio —dijo Sancho—, ¿tienes algún ángel que te saque y que te
quite los grillos que te pienso mandar echar?
— Ahora, señor gobernador —respondió el mozo con muy buen donaire—, estemos
a razón y vengamos al punto. Prosuponga vuestra merced que me manda llevar
a la cárcel, y que en ella me echan grillos y cadenas, y que me meten en un
calabozo, y se le ponen al alcaide graves penas si me deja salir, y que él
lo cumple como se le manda; con todo esto, si yo no quiero dormir, y
estarme despierto toda la noche, sin pegar pestaña, ¿será vuestra merced
bastante con todo su poder para hacerme dormir, si yo no quiero?
— No, por cierto —dijo el secretario—, y el hombre ha salido con su
intención.
— De modo —dijo Sancho— que no dejaréis de dormir por otra cosa que por
vuestra voluntad, y no por contravenir a la mía.
— No, señor —dijo el mozo—, ni por pienso.
— Pues andad con Dios —dijo Sancho—; idos a dormir a vuestra casa, y Dios os
dé buen sueño, que yo no quiero quitárosle; pero aconséjoos que de aquí
adelante no os burléis con la justicia, porque toparéis con alguna que os
dé con la burla en los cascos.
Fuese el mozo, y el gobernador prosiguió con su ronda, y de allí a poco
vinieron dos corchetes que traían a un hombre asido, y dijeron:
— Señor gobernador, este que parece hombre no lo es, sino mujer, y no fea,
que viene vestida en hábito de hombre.
Llegáronle a los ojos dos o tres lanternas, a cuyas luces descubrieron un
rostro de una mujer, al parecer, de diez y seis o pocos más años, recogidos
los cabellos con una redecilla de oro y seda verde, hermosa como mil
perlas. Miráronla de arriba abajo, y vieron que venía con unas medias de
seda encarnada, con ligas de tafetán blanco y rapacejos de oro y aljófar;
los greguescos eran verdes, de tela de oro, y una saltaembarca o ropilla de
lo mesmo, suelta, debajo de la cual traía un jubón de tela finísima de oro
y blanco, y los zapatos eran blancos y de hombre. No traía espada ceñida,
sino una riquísima daga, y en los dedos, muchos y muy buenos anillos.
Finalmente, la moza parecía bien a todos, y ninguno la conoció de cuantos
la vieron, y los naturales del lugar dijeron que no podían pensar quién
fuese, y los consabidores de las burlas que se habían de hacer a Sancho
fueron los que más se admiraron, porque aquel suceso y hallazgo no venía
ordenado por ellos; y así, estaban dudosos, esperando en qué pararía el
caso.
Sancho quedó pasmado de la hermosura de la moza, y preguntóle quién era,
adónde iba y qué ocasión le había movido para vestirse en aquel hábito.
Ella, puestos los ojos en tierra con honestísima vergüenza, respondió:
— No puedo, señor, decir tan en público lo que tanto me importaba fuera
secreto; una cosa quiero que se entienda: que no soy ladrón ni persona
facinorosa, sino una doncella desdichada a quien la fuerza de unos celos ha
hecho romper el decoro que a la honestidad se debe.
Oyendo esto el mayordomo, dijo a Sancho:
— Haga, señor gobernador, apartar la gente, porque esta señora con menos
empacho pueda decir lo que quisiere.
Mandólo así el gobernador; apartáronse todos, si no fueron el mayordomo,
maestresala y el secretario. Viéndose, pues, solos, la doncella prosiguió
diciendo:
— «Yo, señores, soy hija de Pedro Pérez Mazorca, arrendador de las lanas
deste lugar, el cual suele muchas veces ir en casa de mi padre.»
— Eso no lleva camino —dijo el mayordomo—, señora, porque yo conozco muy
bien a Pedro Pérez y sé que no tiene hijo ninguno, ni varón ni hembra; y
más, que decís que es vuestro padre, y luego añadís que suele ir muchas
veces en casa de vuestro padre.
— Ya yo había dado en ello —dijo Sancho.
— Ahora, señores, yo estoy turbada, y no sé lo que me digo —respondió la
doncella—; pero la verdad es que yo soy hija de Diego de la Llana, que
todos vuesas mercedes deben de conocer.
— Aún eso lleva camino —respondió el mayordomo—, que yo conozco a Diego de
la Llana, y sé que es un hidalgo principal y rico, y que tiene un hijo y
una hija, y que después que enviudó no ha habido nadie en todo este lugar
que pueda decir que ha visto el rostro de su hija; que la tiene tan
encerrada que no da lugar al sol que la vea; y, con todo esto, la fama dice
que es en estremo hermosa.
— Así es la verdad —respondió la doncella—, y esa hija soy yo; si la fama
miente o no en mi hermosura ya os habréis, señores, desengañado, pues me
habéis visto.
Y, en esto, comenzó a llorar tiernamente; viendo lo cual el secretario, se
llegó al oído del maestresala y le dijo muy paso:
— Sin duda alguna que a esta pobre doncella le debe de haber sucedido algo
de importancia, pues en tal traje, y a tales horas, y siendo tan principal,
anda fuera de su casa.
— No hay dudar en eso —respondió el maestresala—; y más, que esa sospecha la
confirman sus lágrimas.
Sancho la consoló con las mejores razones que él supo, y le pidió que sin
temor alguno les dijese lo que le había sucedido; que todos procurarían
remediarlo con muchas veras y por todas las vías posibles.
— «Es el caso, señores —respondió ella—, que mi padre me ha tenido encerrada
diez años ha, que son los mismos que a mi madre come la tierra. En casa
dicen misa en un rico oratorio, y yo en todo este tiempo no he visto que el
sol del cielo de día, y la luna y las estrellas de noche, ni sé qué son
calles, plazas, ni templos, ni aun hombres, fuera de mi padre y de un
hermano mío, y de Pedro Pérez el arrendador, que, por entrar de ordinario
en mi casa, se me antojó decir que era mi padre, por no declarar el mío.
Este encerramiento y este negarme el salir de casa, siquiera a la iglesia,
ha muchos días y meses que me trae muy desconsolada; quisiera yo ver el
mundo, o, a lo menos, el pueblo donde nací, pareciéndome que este deseo no
iba contra el buen decoro que las doncellas principales deben guardar a sí
mesmas. Cuando oía decir que corrían toros y jugaban cañas, y se
representaban comedias, preguntaba a mi hermano, que es un año menor que
yo, que me dijese qué cosas eran aquéllas y otras muchas que yo no he
visto; él me lo declaraba por los mejores modos que sabía, pero todo era
encenderme más el deseo de verlo. Finalmente, por abreviar el cuento de mi
perdición, digo que yo rogué y pedí a mi hermano, que nunca tal pidiera ni
tal rogara...»
Y tornó a renovar el llanto. El mayordomo le dijo:
— Prosiga vuestra merced, señora, y acabe de decirnos lo que le ha sucedido,
que nos tienen a todos suspensos sus palabras y sus lágrimas.
— Pocas me quedan por decir —respondió la doncella—, aunque muchas lágrimas
sí que llorar, porque los mal colocados deseos no pueden traer consigo
otros descuentos que los semejantes.
Habíase sentado en el alma del maestresala la belleza de la doncella, y
llegó otra vez su lanterna para verla de nuevo; y parecióle que no eran
lágrimas las que lloraba, sino aljófar o rocío de los prados, y aun las
subía de punto y las llegaba a perlas orientales, y estaba deseando que su
desgracia no fuese tanta como daban a entender los indicios de su llanto y
de sus suspiros. Desesperábase el gobernador de la tardanza que tenía la
moza en dilatar su historia, y díjole que acabase de tenerlos más
suspensos, que era tarde y faltaba mucho que andar del pueblo. Ella, entre
interrotos sollozos y mal formados suspiros, dijo:
— «No es otra mi desgracia, ni mi infortunio es otro sino que yo rogué a mi
hermano que me vistiese en hábitos de hombre con uno de sus vestidos y que
me sacase una noche a ver todo el pueblo, cuando nuestro padre durmiese;
él, importunado de mis ruegos, condecendió con mi deseo, y, poniéndome este
vestido y él vestiéndose de otro mío, que le está como nacido, porque él no
tiene pelo de barba y no parece sino una doncella hermosísima, esta noche,
debe de haber una hora, poco más o menos, nos salimos de casa; y, guiados
de nuestro mozo y desbaratado discurso, hemos rodeado todo el pueblo, y
cuando queríamos volver a casa, vimos venir un gran tropel de gente, y mi
hermano me dijo: ''Hermana, ésta debe de ser la ronda: aligera los pies y
pon alas en ellos, y vente tras mí corriendo, porque no nos conozcan, que
nos será mal contado''. Y, diciendo esto, volvió las espaldas y comenzó, no
digo a correr, sino a volar; yo, a menos de seis pasos, caí, con el
sobresalto, y entonces llegó el ministro de la justicia que me trujo ante
vuestras mercedes, adonde, por mala y antojadiza, me veo avergonzada ante
tanta gente.»
— ¿En efecto, señora —dijo Sancho—, no os ha sucedido otro desmán alguno, ni
celos, como vos al principio de vuestro cuento dijistes, no os sacaron de
vuestra casa?
— No me ha sucedido nada, ni me sacaron celos, sino sólo el deseo de ver
mundo, que no se estendía a más que a ver las calles de este lugar.
Y acabó de confirmar ser verdad lo que la doncella decía llegar los
corchetes con su hermano preso, a quien alcanzó uno dellos cuando se huyó
de su hermana. No traía sino un faldellín rico y una mantellina de damasco
azul con pasamanos de oro fino, la cabeza sin toca ni con otra cosa
adornada que con sus mesmos cabellos, que eran sortijas de oro, según eran
rubios y enrizados. Apartáronse con el gobernador, mayordomo y maestresala,
y, sin que lo oyese su hermana, le preguntaron cómo venía en aquel traje, y
él, con no menos vergüenza y empacho, contó lo mesmo que su hermana había
contado, de que recibió gran gusto el enamorado maestresala. Pero el
gobernador les dijo:
— Por cierto, señores, que ésta ha sido una gran rapacería, y para contar
esta necedad y atrevimiento no eran menester tantas largas, ni tantas
lágrimas y suspiros; que con decir: ''Somos fulano y fulana, que nos
salimos a espaciar de casa de nuestros padres con esta invención, sólo por
curiosidad, sin otro designio alguno'', se acabara el cuento, y no
gemidicos, y lloramicos, y darle.
— Así es la verdad —respondió la doncella—, pero sepan vuesas mercedes que
la turbación que he tenido ha sido tanta, que no me ha dejado guardar el
término que debía.
— No se ha perdido nada —respondió Sancho—. Vamos, y dejaremos a vuesas
mercedes en casa de su padre; quizá no los habrá echado menos. Y, de aquí
adelante, no se muestren tan niños, ni tan deseosos de ver mundo, que la
doncella honrada, la pierna quebrada, y en casa; y la mujer y la gallina,
por andar se pierden aína; y la que es deseosa de ver, también tiene deseo
de ser vista. No digo más.
El mancebo agradeció al gobernador la merced que quería hacerles de
volverlos a su casa, y así, se encaminaron hacia ella, que no estaba muy
lejos de allí. Llegaron, pues, y, tirando el hermano una china a una reja,
al momento bajó una criada, que los estaba esperando, y les abrió la
puerta, y ellos se entraron, dejando a todos admirados, así de su gentileza
y hermosura como del deseo que tenían de ver mundo, de noche y sin salir
del lugar; pero todo lo atribuyeron a su poca edad.
Quedó el maestresala traspasado su corazón, y propuso de luego otro día
pedírsela por mujer a su padre, teniendo por cierto que no se la negaría,
por ser él criado del duque; y aun a Sancho le vinieron deseos y barruntos
de casar al mozo con Sanchica, su hija, y determinó de ponerlo en plática a
su tiempo, dándose a entender que a una hija de un gobernador ningún marido
se le podía negar.
Con esto, se acabó la ronda de aquella noche, y de allí a dos días el
gobierno, con que se destroncaron y borraron todos sus designios, como se
verá adelante.
Capítulo L. Donde se declara quién fueron los encantadores y verdugos que
azotaron a la dueña y pellizcaron y arañaron a don Quijote, con el suceso
que tuvo el paje que llevó la carta a Teresa Sancha, mujer de Sancho Panza
Dice Cide Hamete, puntualísimo escudriñador de los átomos desta verdadera
historia, que al tiempo que doña Rodríguez salió de su aposento para ir a
la estancia de don Quijote, otra dueña que con ella dormía lo sintió, y
que, como todas las dueñas son amigas de saber, entender y oler, se fue
tras ella, con tanto silencio, que la buena Rodríguez no lo echó de ver; y,
así como la dueña la vio entrar en la estancia de don Quijote, porque no
faltase en ella la general costumbre que todas las dueñas tienen de ser
chismosas, al momento lo fue a poner en pico a su señora la duquesa, de
cómo doña Rodríguez quedaba en el aposento de don Quijote.
La duquesa se lo dijo al duque, y le pidió licencia para que ella y
Altisidora viniesen a ver lo que aquella dueña quería con don Quijote; el
duque se la dio, y las dos, con gran tiento y sosiego, paso ante paso,
llegaron a ponerse junto a la puerta del aposento, y tan cerca, que oían
todo lo que dentro hablaban; y, cuando oyó la duquesa que Rodríguez había
echado en la calle el Aranjuez de sus fuentes, no lo pudo sufrir, ni menos
Altisidora; y así, llenas de cólera y deseosas de venganza, entraron de
golpe en el aposento, y acrebillaron a don Quijote y vapularon a la dueña
del modo que queda contado; porque las afrentas que van derechas contra la
hermosura y presunción de las mujeres, despierta en ellas en gran manera la
ira y enciende el deseo de vengarse.
Contó la duquesa al duque lo que le había pasado, de lo que se holgó mucho,
y la duquesa, prosiguiendo con su intención de burlarse y recibir
pasatiempo con don Quijote, despachó al paje que había hecho la figura de
Dulcinea en el concierto de su desencanto —que tenía bien olvidado Sancho
Panza con la ocupación de su gobierno— a Teresa Panza, su mujer, con la
carta de su marido, y con otra suya, y con una gran sarta de corales ricos
presentados.
Dice, pues, la historia, que el paje era muy discreto y agudo, y, con deseo
de servir a sus señores, partió de muy buena gana al lugar de Sancho; y,
antes de entrar en él, vio en un arroyo estar lavando cantidad de mujeres,
a quien preguntó si le sabrían decir si en aquel lugar vivía una mujer
llamada Teresa Panza, mujer de un cierto Sancho Panza, escudero de un
caballero llamado don Quijote de la Mancha, a cuya pregunta se levantó en
pie una mozuela que estaba lavando, y dijo:
— Esa Teresa Panza es mi madre, y ese tal Sancho, mi señor padre, y el tal
caballero, nuestro amo.
— Pues venid, doncella —dijo el paje—, y mostradme a vuestra madre, porque
le traigo una carta y un presente del tal vuestro padre.
— Eso haré yo de muy buena gana, señor mío —respondió la moza, que mostraba
ser de edad de catorce años, poco más a menos.
Y, dejando la ropa que lavaba a otra compañera, sin tocarse ni calzarse,
que estaba en piernas y desgreñada, saltó delante de la cabalgadura del
paje, y dijo:
— Venga vuesa merced, que a la entrada del pueblo está nuestra casa, y mi
madre en ella, con harta pena por no haber sabido muchos días ha de mi
señor padre.
— Pues yo se las llevo tan buenas —dijo el paje— que tiene que dar bien
gracias a Dios por ellas.
Finalmente, saltando, corriendo y brincando, llegó al pueblo la muchacha,
y, antes de entrar en su casa, dijo a voces desde la puerta:
— Salga, madre Teresa, salga, salga, que viene aquí un señor que trae cartas
y otras cosas de mi buen padre.
A cuyas voces salió Teresa Panza, su madre, hilando un copo de estopa, con
una saya parda. Parecía, según era de corta, que se la habían cortado por
vergonzoso lugar, con un corpezuelo asimismo pardo y una camisa de pechos.
No era muy vieja, aunque mostraba pasar de los cuarenta, pero fuerte,
tiesa, nervuda y avellanada; la cual, viendo a su hija, y al paje a
caballo, le dijo:
— ¿Qué es esto, niña? ¿Qué señor es éste?
— Es un servidor de mi señora doña Teresa Panza —respondió el paje.
Y, diciendo y haciendo, se arrojó del caballo y se fue con mucha humildad a
poner de hinojos ante la señora Teresa, diciendo:
— Déme vuestra merced sus manos, mi señora doña Teresa, bien así como mujer
legítima y particular del señor don Sancho Panza, gobernador propio de la
ínsula Barataria.
— ¡Ay, señor mío, quítese de ahí; no haga eso —respondió Teresa—, que yo no
soy nada palaciega, sino una pobre labradora, hija de un estripaterrones y
mujer de un escudero andante, y no de gobernador alguno!
— Vuesa merced —respondió el paje— es mujer dignísima de un gobernador
archidignísimo; y, para prueba desta verdad, reciba vuesa merced esta carta
y este presente.
Y sacó al instante de la faldriquera una sarta de corales con estremos de
oro, y se la echó al cuello y dijo:
— Esta carta es del señor gobernador, y otra que traigo y estos corales son
de mi señora la duquesa, que a vuestra merced me envía.
Quedó pasmada Teresa, y su hija ni más ni menos, y la muchacha dijo:
— Que me maten si no anda por aquí nuestro señor amo don Quijote, que debe
de haber dado a padre el gobierno o condado que tantas veces le había
prometido.
— Así es la verdad —respondió el paje—: que, por respeto del señor don
Quijote, es ahora el señor Sancho gobernador de la ínsula Barataria, como
se verá por esta carta.
— Léamela vuesa merced, señor gentilhombre —dijo Teresa—, porque, aunque yo
sé hilar, no sé leer migaja.
— Ni yo tampoco —añadió Sanchica—; pero espérenme aquí, que yo iré a llamar
quien la lea, ora sea el cura mesmo, o el bachiller Sansón Carrasco, que
vendrán de muy buena gana, por saber nuevas de mi padre.
— No hay para qué se llame a nadie, que yo no sé hilar, pero sé leer, y la
leeré.
Y así, se la leyó toda, que, por quedar ya referida, no se pone aquí; y
luego sacó otra de la duquesa, que decía desta manera:
Amiga Teresa:
Las buenas partes de la bondad y del ingenio de vuestro marido Sancho me
movieron y obligaron a pedir a mi marido el duque le diese un gobierno de
una ínsula, de muchas que tiene. Tengo noticia que gobierna como un
girifalte, de lo que yo estoy muy contenta, y el duque mi señor, por el
consiguiente; por lo que doy muchas gracias al cielo de no haberme engañado
en haberle escogido para el tal gobierno; porque quiero que sepa la señora
Teresa que con dificultad se halla un buen gobernador en el mundo, y tal me
haga a mí Dios como Sancho gobierna.
Ahí le envío, querida mía, una sarta de corales con estremos de oro; yo me
holgara que fuera de perlas orientales, pero quien te da el hueso, no te
querría ver muerta: tiempo vendrá en que nos conozcamos y nos comuniquemos,
y Dios sabe lo que será. Encomiéndeme a Sanchica, su hija, y dígale de mi
parte que se apareje, que la tengo de casar altamente cuando menos lo
piense.
Dícenme que en ese lugar hay bellotas gordas: envíeme hasta dos docenas,
que las estimaré en mucho, por ser de su mano, y escríbame largo,
avisándome de su salud y de su bienestar; y si hubiere menester alguna
cosa, no tiene que hacer más que boquear: que su boca será medida, y Dios
me la guarde. Deste lugar.
Su amiga, que bien la quiere,
La Duquesa.
— ¡Ay —dijo Teresa en oyendo la carta—, y qué buena y qué llana y qué
humilde señora! Con estas tales señoras me entierren a mí, y no las
hidalgas que en este pueblo se usan, que piensan que por ser hidalgas no
las ha de tocar el viento, y van a la iglesia con tanta fantasía como si
fuesen las mesmas reinas, que no parece sino que tienen a deshonra el mirar
a una labradora; y veis aquí donde esta buena señora, con ser duquesa, me
llama amiga, y me trata como si fuera su igual, que igual la vea yo con el
más alto campanario que hay en la Mancha. Y, en lo que toca a las bellotas,
señor mío, yo le enviaré a su señoría un celemín, que por gordas las pueden
venir a ver a la mira y a la maravilla. Y por ahora, Sanchica, atiende a
que se regale este señor: pon en orden este caballo, y saca de la
caballeriza güevos, y corta tocino adunia, y démosle de comer como a un
príncipe, que las buenas nuevas que nos ha traído y la buena cara que él
tiene lo merece todo; y, en tanto, saldré yo a dar a mis vecinas las nuevas
de nuestro contento, y al padre cura y a maese Nicolás el barbero, que tan
amigos son y han sido de tu padre.
— Sí haré, madre —respondió Sanchica—; pero mire que me ha de dar la mitad
desa sarta; que no tengo yo por tan boba a mi señora la duquesa, que se la
había de enviar a ella toda.
— Todo es para ti, hija —respondió Teresa—, pero déjamela traer algunos
días al cuello, que verdaderamente parece que me alegra el corazón.
— También se alegrarán —dijo el paje— cuando vean el lío que viene en este
portamanteo, que es un vestido de paño finísimo que el gobernador sólo un
día llevó a caza, el cual todo le envía para la señora Sanchica.
— Que me viva él mil años —respondió Sanchica—, y el que lo trae, ni más ni
menos, y aun dos mil, si fuere necesidad.
Salióse en esto Teresa fuera de casa, con las cartas, y con la sarta al
cuello, y iba tañendo en las cartas como si fuera en un pandero; y,
encontrándose acaso con el cura y Sansón Carrasco, comenzó a bailar y a
decir:
— ¡A fee que agora que no hay pariente pobre! ¡Gobiernito tenemos! ¡No, sino
tómese conmigo la más pintada hidalga, que yo la pondré como nueva!
— ¿Qué es esto, Teresa Panza? ¿Qué locuras son éstas, y qué papeles son
ésos?
— No es otra la locura sino que éstas son cartas de duquesas y de
gobernadores, y estos que traigo al cuello son corales finos; las avemarías
y los padres nuestros son de oro de martillo, y yo soy gobernadora.
— De Dios en ayuso, no os entendemos, Teresa, ni sabemos lo que os decís.
— Ahí lo podrán ver ellos —respondió Teresa.
Y dioles las cartas. Leyólas el cura de modo que las oyó Sansón Carrasco, y
Sansón y el cura se miraron el uno al otro, como admirados de lo que habían
leído; y preguntó el bachiller quién había traído aquellas cartas.
Respondió Teresa que se viniesen con ella a su casa y verían el mensajero,
que era un mancebo como un pino de oro, y que le traía otro presente que
valía más de tanto. Quitóle el cura los corales del cuello, y mirólos y
remirólos, y, certificándose que eran finos, tornó a admirarse de nuevo, y
dijo:
— Por el hábito que tengo, que no sé qué me diga ni qué me piense de estas
cartas y destos presentes: por una parte, veo y toco la fineza de estos
corales, y por otra, leo que una duquesa envía a pedir dos docenas de
bellotas.
— ¡Aderézame esas medidas! —dijo entonces Carrasco—. Agora bien, vamos a ver
al portador deste pliego, que dél nos informaremos de las dificultades que
se nos ofrecen.
Hiciéronlo así, y volvióse Teresa con ellos. Hallaron al paje cribando un
poco de cebada para su cabalgadura, y a Sanchica cortando un torrezno para
empedrarle con güevos y dar de comer al paje, cuya presencia y buen adorno
contentó mucho a los dos; y, después de haberle saludado cortésmente, y él
a ellos, le preguntó Sansón les dijese nuevas así de don Quijote como de
Sancho Panza; que, puesto que habían leído las cartas de Sancho y de la
señora duquesa, todavía estaban confusos y no acababan de atinar qué sería
aquello del gobierno de Sancho, y más de una ínsula, siendo todas o las más
que hay en el mar Mediterráneo de Su Majestad. A lo que el paje respondió:
— De que el señor Sancho Panza sea gobernador, no hay que dudar en ello; de
que sea ínsula o no la que gobierna, en eso no me entremeto, pero basta que
sea un lugar de más de mil vecinos; y, en cuanto a lo de las bellotas, digo
que mi señora la duquesa es tan llana y tan humilde, que no —decía él—
enviar a pedir bellotas a una labradora, pero que le acontecía enviar a
pedir un peine prestado a una vecina suya. Porque quiero que sepan vuestras
mercedes que las señoras de Aragón, aunque son tan principales, no son tan
puntuosas y levantadas como las señoras castellanas; con más llaneza tratan
con las gentes.
Estando en la mitad destas pláticas, saltó Sanchica con un halda de güevos,
y preguntó al paje:
— Dígame, señor: ¿mi señor padre trae por ventura calzas atacadas después
que es gobernador?
— No he mirado en ello —respondió el paje—, pero sí debe de traer.
— ¡Ay Dios mío —replicó Sanchica—, y que será de ver a mi padre con
pedorreras! ¿No es bueno sino que desde que nací tengo deseo de ver a mi
padre con calzas atacadas?
— Como con esas cosas le verá vuestra merced si vive —respondió el paje—.
Par Dios, términos lleva de caminar con papahígo, con solos dos meses que
le dure el gobierno.
Bien echaron de ver el cura y el bachiller que el paje hablaba
socarronamente, pero la fineza de los corales y el vestido de caza que
Sancho enviaba lo deshacía todo; que ya Teresa les había mostrado el
vestido. Y no dejaron de reírse del deseo de Sanchica, y más cuando Teresa
dijo:
— Señor cura, eche cata por ahí si hay alguien que vaya a Madrid, o a
Toledo, para que me compre un verdugado redondo, hecho y derecho, y sea al
uso y de los mejores que hubiere; que en verdad en verdad que tengo de
honrar el gobierno de mi marido en cuanto yo pudiere, y aun que si me
enojo, me tengo de ir a esa corte, y echar un coche, como todas; que la que
tiene marido gobernador muy bien le puede traer y sustentar.
— Y ¡cómo, madre! —dijo Sanchica—. Pluguiese a Dios que fuese antes hoy que
mañana, aunque dijesen los que me viesen ir sentada con mi señora madre en
aquel coche: ''¡Mirad la tal por cual, hija del harto de ajos, y cómo va
sentada y tendida en el coche, como si fuera una papesa!'' Pero pisen ellos
los lodos, y ándeme yo en mi coche, levantados los pies del suelo. ¡Mal
año y mal mes para cuantos murmuradores hay en el mundo, y ándeme yo
caliente, y ríase la gente! ¿Digo bien, madre mía?
— Y ¡cómo que dices bien, hija! —respondió Teresa—. Y todas estas venturas,
y aun mayores, me las tiene profetizadas mi buen Sancho, y verás tú, hija,
cómo no para hasta hacerme condesa: que todo es comenzar a ser venturosas;
y, como yo he oído decir muchas veces a tu buen padre, que así como lo es
tuyo lo es de los refranes, cuando te dieren la vaquilla, corre con
soguilla: cuando te dieren un gobierno, cógele; cuando te dieren un
condado, agárrale, y cuando te hicieren tus, tus, con alguna buena dádiva,
envásala. ¡No, sino dormíos, y no respondáis a las venturas y buenas dichas
que están llamando a la puerta de vuestra casa!
— Y ¿qué se me da a mí —añadió Sanchica— que diga el que quisiere cuando me
vea entonada y fantasiosa: "Viose el perro en bragas de cerro...", y lo
demás?
Oyendo lo cual el cura, dijo:
— Yo no puedo creer sino que todos los deste linaje de los Panzas nacieron
cada uno con un costal de refranes en el cuerpo: ninguno dellos he visto
que no los derrame a todas horas y en todas las pláticas que tienen.
— Así es la verdad —dijo el paje—, que el señor gobernador Sancho a cada
paso los dice, y, aunque muchos no vienen a propósito, todavía dan gusto, y
mi señora la duquesa y el duque los celebran mucho.
— ¿Que todavía se afirma vuestra merced, señor mío —dijo el bachiller—, ser
verdad esto del gobierno de Sancho, y de que hay duquesa en el mundo que le
envíe presentes y le escriba? Porque nosotros, aunque tocamos los presentes
y hemos leído las cartas, no lo creemos, y pensamos que ésta es una de las
cosas de don Quijote, nuestro compatrioto, que todas piensa que son hechas
por encantamento; y así, estoy por decir que quiero tocar y palpar a
vuestra merced, por ver si es embajador fantástico o hombre de carne y
hueso.
— Señores, yo no sé más de mí —respondió el paje— sino que soy embajador
verdadero, y que el señor Sancho Panza es gobernador efectivo, y que mis
señores duque y duquesa pueden dar, y han dado, el tal gobierno; y que he
oído decir que en él se porta valentísimamente el tal Sancho Panza; si en
esto hay encantamento o no, vuestras mercedes lo disputen allá entre ellos,
que yo no sé otra cosa, para el juramento que hago, que es por vida de mis
padres, que los tengo vivos y los amo y los quiero mucho.
— Bien podrá ello ser así —replicó el bachiller—, pero dubitat Augustinus.
— Dude quien dudare —respondió el paje—, la verdad es la que he dicho, y
esta que ha de andar siempre sobre la mentira,como el aceite sobre el agua;
y si no, operibus credite, et non verbis: véngase alguno de vuesas mercedes
conmigo, y verán con los ojos lo que no creen por los oídos.
— Esa ida a mí toca —dijo Sanchica—: lléveme vuestra merced, señor, a las
ancas de su rocín, que yo iré de muy buena gana a ver a mi señor padre.
— Las hijas de los gobernadores no han de ir solas por los caminos, sino
acompañadas de carrozas y literas y de gran número de sirvientes.
— Par Dios —respondió Sancha—, tan bién me vaya yo sobre una pollina como
sobre un coche. ¡Hallado la habéis la melindrosa!
— Calla, mochacha —dijo Teresa—, que no sabes lo que te dices, y este señor
está en lo cierto: que tal el tiempo, tal el tiento; cuando Sancho, Sancha,
y cuando gobernador, señora, y no sé si diga algo.
— Más dice la señora Teresa de lo que piensa —dijo el paje—; y denme de
comer y despáchenme luego, porque pienso volverme esta tarde.
A lo que dijo el cura:
— Vuestra merced se vendrá a hacer penitencia conmigo, que la señora Teresa
más tiene voluntad que alhajas para servir a tan buen huésped.
Rehusólo el paje; pero, en efecto, lo hubo de conceder por su mejora, y el
cura le llevó consigo de buena gana, por tener lugar de preguntarle de
espacio por don Quijote y sus hazañas.
El bachiller se ofreció de escribir las cartas a Teresa de la respuesta,
pero ella no quiso que el bachiller se metiese en sus cosas, que le tenía
por algo burlón; y así, dio un bollo y dos huevos a un monacillo que sabía
escribir, el cual le escribió dos cartas, una para su marido y otra para la
duquesa, notadas de su mismo caletre, que no son las peores que en esta
grande historia se ponen, como se verá adelante.
Capítulo LI. Del progreso del gobierno de Sancho Panza, con otros sucesos
tales como buenos
Amaneció el día que se siguió a la noche de la ronda del gobernador, la
cual el maestresala pasó sin dormir, ocupado el pensamiento en el rostro,
brío y belleza de la disfrazada doncella; y el mayordomo ocupó lo que della
faltaba en escribir a sus señores lo que Sancho Panza hacía y decía, tan
admirado de sus hechos como de sus dichos: porque andaban mezcladas sus
palabras y sus acciones, con asomos discretos y tontos.
Levantóse, en fin, el señor gobernador, y, por orden del doctor Pedro
Recio, le hicieron desayunar con un poco de conserva y cuatro tragos de
agua fría, cosa que la trocara Sancho con un pedazo de pan y un racimo de
uvas; pero, viendo que aquello era más fuerza que voluntad, pasó por ello,
con harto dolor de su alma y fatiga de su estómago, haciéndole creer Pedro
Recio que los manjares pocos y delicados avivaban el ingenio, que era lo
que más convenía a las personas constituidas en mandos y en oficios graves,
donde se han de aprovechar no tanto de las fuerzas corporales como de las
del entendimiento.
Con esta sofistería padecía hambre Sancho, y tal, que en su secreto
maldecía el gobierno y aun a quien se le había dado; pero, con su hambre y
con su conserva, se puso a juzgar aquel día, y lo primero que se le ofreció
fue una pregunta que un forastero le hizo, estando presentes a todo el
mayordomo y los demás acólitos, que fue:
— Señor, un caudaloso río dividía dos términos de un mismo señorío (y esté
vuestra merced atento, porque el caso es de importancia y algo
dificultoso). Digo, pues, que sobre este río estaba una puente, y al cabo
della, una horca y una como casa de audiencia, en la cual de ordinario
había cuatro jueces que juzgaban la ley que puso el dueño del río, de la
puente y del señorío, que era en esta forma: "Si alguno pasare por esta
puente de una parte a otra, ha de jurar primero adónde y a qué va; y si
jurare verdad, déjenle pasar; y si dijere mentira, muera por ello ahorcado
en la horca que allí se muestra, sin remisión alguna". Sabida esta ley y la
rigurosa condición della, pasaban muchos, y luego en lo que juraban se
echaba de ver que decían verdad, y los jueces los dejaban pasar
libremente. Sucedió, pues, que, tomando juramento a un hombre, juró y dijo
que para el juramento que hacía, que iba a morir en aquella horca que allí
estaba, y no a otra cosa. Repararon los jueces en el juramento y dijeron:
''Si a este hombre le dejamos pasar libremente, mintió en su juramento, y,
conforme a la ley, debe morir; y si le ahorcamos, él juró que iba a morir
en aquella horca, y, habiendo jurado verdad, por la misma ley debe ser
libre''. Pídese a vuesa merced, señor gobernador, qué harán los jueces del
tal hombre; que aun hasta agora están dudosos y suspensos. Y, habiendo
tenido noticia del agudo y elevado entendimiento de vuestra merced, me
enviaron a mí a que suplicase a vuestra merced de su parte diese su parecer
en tan intricado y dudoso caso.
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— Por cierto que esos señores jueces que a mí os envían lo pudieran haber
escusado, porque yo soy un hombre que tengo más de mostrenco que de agudo;
pero, con todo eso, repetidme otra vez el negocio de modo que yo le
entienda: quizá podría ser que diese en el hito.
Volvió otra y otra vez el preguntante a referir lo que primero había dicho,
y Sancho dijo:
— A mi parecer, este negocio en dos paletas le declararé yo, y es así: el
tal hombre jura que va a morir en la horca, y si muere en ella, juró
verdad, y por la ley puesta merece ser libre y que pase la puente; y si no
le ahorcan, juró mentira, y por la misma ley merece que le ahorquen.
— Así es como el señor gobernador dice —dijo el mensajero—; y cuanto a la
entereza y entendimiento del caso, no hay más que pedir ni que dudar.
— Digo yo, pues, agora —replicó Sancho— que deste hombre aquella parte que
juró verdad la dejen pasar, y la que dijo mentira la ahorquen, y desta
manera se cumplirá al pie de la letra la condición del pasaje.
— Pues, señor gobernador —replicó el preguntador—, será necesario que el tal
hombre se divida en partes, en mentirosa y verdadera; y si se divide, por
fuerza ha de morir, y así no se consigue cosa alguna de lo que la ley pide,
y es de necesidad espresa que se cumpla con ella.
— Venid acá, señor buen hombre —respondió Sancho—; este pasajero que decís,
o yo soy un porro, o él tiene la misma razón para morir que para vivir y
pasar la puente; porque si la verdad le salva, la mentira le condena
igualmente; y, siendo esto así, como lo es, soy de parecer que digáis a
esos señores que a mí os enviaron que, pues están en un fil las razones de
condenarle o asolverle, que le dejen pasar libremente, pues siempre es
alabado más el hacer bien que mal, y esto lo diera firmado de mi nombre, si
supiera firmar; y yo en este caso no he hablado de mío, sino que se me vino
a la memoria un precepto, entre otros muchos que me dio mi amo don Quijote
la noche antes que viniese a ser gobernador desta ínsula: que fue que,
cuando la justicia estuviese en duda, me decantase y acogiese a la
misericordia; y ha querido Dios que agora se me acordase, por venir en este
caso como de molde.
Así es —respondió el mayordomo—, y tengo para mí que el mismo Licurgo, que
dio leyes a los lacedemonios, no pudiera dar mejor sentencia que la que el
gran Panza ha dado. Y acábese con esto la audiencia desta mañana, y yo daré
orden como el señor gobernador coma muy a su gusto.
— Eso pido, y barras derechas —dijo Sancho—: denme de comer, y lluevan casos
y dudas sobre mí, que yo las despabilaré en el aire.
Cumplió su palabra el mayordomo, pareciéndole ser cargo de conciencia matar
de hambre a tan discreto gobernador; y más, que pensaba concluir con él
aquella misma noche haciéndole la burla última que traía en comisión de
hacerle.
Sucedió, pues, que, habiendo comido aquel día contra las reglas y aforismos
del doctor Tirteafuera, al levantar de los manteles, entró un correo con
una carta de don Quijote para el gobernador. Mandó Sancho al secretario que
la leyese para sí, y que si no viniese en ella alguna cosa digna de
secreto, la leyese en voz alta. Hízolo así el secretario, y, repasándola
primero, dijo:
— Bien se puede leer en voz alta, que lo que el señor don Quijote escribe a
vuestra merced merece estar estampado y escrito con letras de oro, y dice
así:
Carta de don Quijote de la Mancha a Sancho Panza, gobernador de la ínsula
Barataria
Cuando esperaba oír nuevas de tus descuidos e impertinencias, Sancho amigo,
las oí de tus discreciones, de que di por ello gracias particulares al
cielo, el cual del estiércol sabe levantar los pobres, y de los tontos
hacer discretos. Dícenme que gobiernas como si fueses hombre, y que eres
hombre como si fueses bestia, según es la humildad con que te tratas; y
quiero que adviertas, Sancho, que muchas veces conviene y es necesario, por
la autoridad del oficio, ir contra la humildad del corazón; porque el buen
adorno de la persona que está puesta en graves cargos ha de ser conforme a
lo que ellos piden, y no a la medida de lo que su humilde condición le
inclina. Vístete bien, que un palo compuesto no parece palo. No digo que
traigas dijes ni galas, ni que siendo juez te vistas como soldado, sino que
te adornes con el hábito que tu oficio requiere, con tal que sea limpio y
bien compuesto.
Para ganar la voluntad del pueblo que gobiernas, entre otras has de hacer
dos cosas: la una, ser bien criado con todos, aunque esto ya otra vez te lo
he dicho; y la otra, procurar la abundancia de los mantenimientos; que no
hay cosa que más fatigue el corazón de los pobres que la hambre y la
carestía.
No hagas muchas pragmáticas; y si las hicieres, procura que sean buenas, y,
sobre todo, que se guarden y cumplan; que las pragmáticas que no se
guardan, lo mismo es que si no lo fuesen; antes dan a entender que el
príncipe que tuvo discreción y autoridad para hacerlas, no tuvo valor para
hacer que se guardasen; y las leyes que atemorizan y no se ejecutan, vienen
a ser como la viga, rey de las ranas: que al principio las espantó, y con
el tiempo la menospreciaron y se subieron sobre ella.
Sé padre de las virtudes y padrastro de los vicios. No seas siempre
riguroso, ni siempre blando, y escoge el medio entre estos dos estremos,
que en esto está el punto de la discreción. Visita las cárceles, las
carnicerías y las plazas, que la presencia del gobernador en lugares tales
es de mucha importancia: consuela a los presos, que esperan la brevedad de
su despacho; es coco a los carniceros, que por entonces igualan los pesos,
y es espantajo a las placeras, por la misma razón. No te muestres, aunque
por ventura lo seas —lo cual yo no creo—, codicioso, mujeriego ni glotón;
porque, en sabiendo el pueblo y los que te tratan tu inclinación
determinada, por allí te darán batería, hasta derribarte en el profundo de
la perdición.
Mira y remira, pasa y repasa los consejos y documentos que te di por
escrito antes que de aquí partieses a tu gobierno, y verás como hallas en
ellos, si los guardas, una ayuda de costa que te sobrelleve los trabajos y
dificultades que a cada paso a los gobernadores se les ofrecen. Escribe a
tus señores y muéstrateles agradecido, que la ingratitud es hija de la
soberbia, y uno de los mayores pecados que se sabe, y la persona que es
agradecida a los que bien le han hecho, da indicio que también lo será a
Dios, que tantos bienes le hizo y de contino le hace.
La señora duquesa despachó un propio con tu vestido y otro presente a tu
mujer Teresa Panza; por momentos esperamos respuesta.
Yo he estado un poco mal dispuesto de un cierto gateamiento que me sucedió
no muy a cuento de mis narices; pero no fue nada, que si hay encantadores
que me maltraten, también los hay que me defiendan.
Avísame si el mayordomo que está contigo tuvo que ver en las acciones de la
Trifaldi, como tú sospechaste, y de todo lo que te sucediere me irás dando
aviso, pues es tan corto el camino; cuanto más, que yo pienso dejar presto
esta vida ociosa en que estoy, pues no nací para ella.
Un negocio se me ha ofrecido, que creo que me ha de poner en desgracia
destos señores; pero, aunque se me da mucho, no se me da nada, pues, en fin
en fin, tengo de cumplir antes con mi profesión que con su gusto, conforme
a lo que suele decirse: amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas. Dígote este
latín porque me doy a entender que, después que eres gobernador, lo habrás
aprendido. Y a Dios, el cual te guarde de que ninguno te tenga lástima.
Tu amigo,
Don Quijote de la Mancha.
Oyó Sancho la carta con mucha atención, y fue celebrada y tenida por
discreta de los que la oyeron; y luego Sancho se levantó de la mesa, y,
llamando al secretario, se encerró con él en su estancia, y, sin dilatarlo
más, quiso responder luego a su señor don Quijote, y dijo al secretario
que, sin añadir ni quitar cosa alguna, fuese escribiendo lo que él le
dijese, y así lo hizo; y la carta de la respuesta fue del tenor siguiente:
Carta de Sancho Panza a don Quijote de la Mancha
La ocupación de mis negocios es tan grande que no tengo lugar para rascarme
la cabeza, ni aun para cortarme las uñas; y así, las traigo tan crecidas
cual Dios lo remedie. Digo esto, señor mío de mi alma, porque vuesa merced
no se espante si hasta agora no he dado aviso de mi bien o mal estar en
este gobierno, en el cual tengo más hambre que cuando andábamos los dos por
las selvas y por los despoblados.
Escribióme el duque, mi señor, el otro día, dándome aviso que habían
entrado en esta ínsula ciertas espías para matarme, y hasta agora yo no he
descubierto otra que un cierto doctor que está en este lugar asalariado
para matar a cuantos gobernadores aquí vinieren: llámase el doctor Pedro
Recio, y es natural de Tirteafuera: ¡porque vea vuesa merced qué nombre
para no temer que he de morir a sus manos! Este tal doctor dice él mismo de
sí mismo que él no cura las enfermedades cuando las hay, sino que las
previene, para que no vengan; y las medecinas que usa son dieta y más
dieta, hasta poner la persona en los huesos mondos, como si no fuese mayor
mal la flaqueza que la calentura. Finalmente, él me va matando de hambre, y
yo me voy muriendo de despecho, pues cuando pensé venir a este gobierno a
comer caliente y a beber frío, y a recrear el cuerpo entre sábanas de
holanda, sobre colchones de pluma, he venido a hacer penitencia, como si
fuera ermitaño; y, como no la hago de mi voluntad, pienso que, al cabo al
cabo, me ha de llevar el diablo.
Hasta agora no he tocado derecho ni llevado cohecho, y no puedo pensar en
qué va esto; porque aquí me han dicho que los gobernadores que a esta
ínsula suelen venir, antes de entrar en ella, o les han dado o les han
prestado los del pueblo muchos dineros, y que ésta es ordinaria usanza en
los demás que van a gobiernos, no solamente en éste.
Anoche, andando de ronda, topé una muy hermosa doncella en traje de varón y
un hermano suyo en hábito de mujer; de la moza se enamoró mi maestresala, y
la escogió en su imaginación para su mujer, según él ha dicho, y yo escogí
al mozo para mi yerno; hoy los dos pondremos en plática nuestros
pensamientos con el padre de entrambos, que es un tal Diego de la Llana,
hidalgo y cristiano viejo cuanto se quiere.
Yo visito las plazas, como vuestra merced me lo aconseja, y ayer hallé una
tendera que vendía avellanas nuevas, y averigüéle que había mezclado con
una hanega de avellanas nuevas otra de viejas, vanas y podridas; apliquélas
todas para los niños de la doctrina, que las sabrían bien distinguir, y
sentenciéla que por quince días no entrase en la plaza. Hanme dicho que lo
hice valerosamente; lo que sé decir a vuestra merced es que es fama en este
pueblo que no hay gente más mala que las placeras, porque todas son
desvergonzadas, desalmadas y atrevidas, y yo así lo creo, por las que he
visto en otros pueblos.
De que mi señora la duquesa haya escrito a mi mujer Teresa Panza y
enviádole el presente que vuestra merced dice, estoy muy satisfecho, y
procuraré de mostrarme agradecido a su tiempo: bésele vuestra merced las
manos de mi parte, diciendo que digo yo que no lo ha echado en saco roto,
como lo verá por la obra.
No querría que vuestra merced tuviese trabacuentas de disgusto con esos mis
señores, porque si vuestra merced se enoja con ellos, claro está que ha de
redundar en mi daño, y no será bien que, pues se me da a mí por consejo que
sea agradecido, que vuestra merced no lo sea con quien tantas mercedes le
tiene hechas y con tanto regalo ha sido tratado en su castillo.
Aquello del gateado no entiendo, pero imagino que debe de ser alguna de las
malas fechorías que con vuestra merced suelen usar los malos encantadores;
yo lo sabré cuando nos veamos.
Quisiera enviarle a vuestra merced alguna cosa, pero no sé qué envíe, si no
es algunos cañutos de jeringas, que para con vejigas los hacen en esta
ínsula muy curiosos; aunque si me dura el oficio, yo buscaré qué enviar de
haldas o de mangas.
Si me escribiere mi mujer Teresa Panza, pague vuestra merced el porte y
envíeme la carta,que tengo grandísimo deseo de saber del estado de mi casa,
de mi mujer y de mis hijos. Y con esto, Dios libre a vuestra merced de mal
intencionados encantadores, y a mí me saque con bien y en paz deste
gobierno, que lo dudo, porque le pienso dejar con la vida, según me trata
el doctor Pedro Recio.
Criado de vuestra merced,
Sancho Panza, el Gobernador.
Cerró la carta el secretario y despachó luego al correo; y, juntándose los
burladores de Sancho, dieron orden entre sí cómo despacharle del gobierno;
y aquella tarde la pasó Sancho en hacer algunas ordenanzas tocantes al buen
gobierno de la que él imaginaba ser ínsula, y ordenó que no hubiese
regatones de los bastimentos en la república, y que pudiesen meter en ella
vino de las partes que quisiesen, con aditamento que declarasen el lugar de
donde era, para ponerle el precio según su estimación, bondad y fama, y el
que lo aguase o le mudase el nombre, perdiese la vida por ello.
Moderó el precio de todo calzado, principalmente el de los zapatos, por
parecerle que corría con exorbitancia; puso tasa en los salarios de los
criados, que caminaban a rienda suelta por el camino del interese; puso
gravísimas penas a los que cantasen cantares lascivos y descompuestos, ni
de noche ni de día. Ordenó que ningún ciego cantase milagro en coplas si no
trujese testimonio auténtico de ser verdadero, por parecerle que los más
que los ciegos cantan son fingidos, en perjuicio de los verdaderos.
Hizo y creó un alguacil de pobres, no para que los persiguiese, sino para
que los examinase si lo eran, porque a la sombra de la manquedad fingida y
de la llaga falsa andan los brazos ladrones y la salud borracha. En
resolución: él ordenó cosas tan buenas que hasta hoy se guardan en aquel
lugar, y se nombran Las constituciones del gran gobernador Sancho Panza.
Capítulo LII. Donde se cuenta la aventura de la segunda dueña Dolorida, o
Angustiada, llamada por otro nombre doña Rodríguez
Cuenta Cide Hamete que estando ya don Quijote sano de sus aruños, le
pareció que la vida que en aquel castillo tenía era contra toda la orden de
caballería que profesaba, y así, determinó de pedir licencia a los duques
para partirse a Zaragoza, cuyas fiestas llegaban cerca, adonde pensaba
ganar el arnés que en las tales fiestas se conquista.
Y, estando un día a la mesa con los duques, y comenzando a poner en obra su
intención y pedir la licencia, veis aquí a deshora entrar por la puerta de
la gran sala dos mujeres, como después pareció, cubiertas de luto de los
pies a la cabeza, y la una dellas, llegándose a don Quijote, se le echó a
los pies tendida de largo a largo, la boca cosida con los pies de don
Quijote, y daba unos gemidos tan tristes, tan profundos y tan dolorosos,
que puso en confusión a todos los que la oían y miraban; y, aunque los
duques pensaron que sería alguna burla que sus criados querían hacer a don
Quijote, todavía, viendo con el ahínco que la mujer suspiraba, gemía y
lloraba, los tuvo dudosos y suspensos, hasta que don Quijote, compasivo, la
levantó del suelo y hizo que se descubriese y quitase el manto de sobre la
faz llorosa.
Ella lo hizo así, y mostró ser lo que jamás se pudiera pensar, porque
descubrió el rostro de doña Rodríguez, la dueña de casa, y la otra enlutada
era su hija, la burlada del hijo del labrador rico. Admiráronse todos
aquellos que la conocían, y más los duques que ninguno; que, puesto que la
tenían por boba y de buena pasta, no por tanto que viniese a hacer locuras.
Finalmente, doña Rodríguez, volviéndose a los señores, les dijo:
— Vuesas excelencias sean servidos de darme licencia que yo departa un poco
con este caballero, porque así conviene para salir con bien del negocio en
que me ha puesto el atrevimiento de un mal intencionado villano.
El duque dijo que él se la daba, y que departiese con el señor don Quijote
cuanto le viniese en deseo. Ella, enderezando la voz y el rostro a don
Quijote, dijo:
— Días ha, valeroso caballero, que os tengo dada cuenta de la sinrazón y
alevosía que un mal labrador tiene fecha a mi muy querida y amada fija, que
es esta desdichada que aquí está presente, y vos me habedes prometido de
volver por ella, enderezándole el tuerto que le tienen fecho, y agora ha
llegado a mi noticia que os queredes partir deste castillo, en busca de las
buenas venturas que Dios os depare; y así, querría que, antes que os
escurriésedes por esos caminos, desafiásedes a este rústico indómito, y le
hiciésedes que se casase con mi hija, en cumplimiento de la palabra que le
dio de ser su esposo, antes y primero que yogase con ella; porque pensar
que el duque mi señor me ha de hacer justicia es pedir peras al olmo, por
la ocasión que ya a vuesa merced en puridad tengo declarada. Y con esto,
Nuestro Señor dé a vuesa merced mucha salud, y a nosotras no nos desampare.
A cuyas razones respondió don Quijote, con mucha gravedad y prosopopeya:
— Buena dueña, templad vuestras lágrimas, o, por mejor decir, enjugadlas y
ahorrad de vuestros suspiros, que yo tomo a mi cargo el remedio de vuestra
hija, a la cual le hubiera estado mejor no haber sido tan fácil en creer
promesas de enamorados, las cuales, por la mayor parte, son ligeras de
prometer y muy pesadas de cumplir; y así, con licencia del duque mi señor,
yo me partiré luego en busca dese desalmado mancebo, y le hallaré, y le
desafiaré, y le mataré cada y cuando que se escusare de cumplir la
prometida palabra; que el principal asumpto de mi profesión es perdonar a
los humildes y castigar a los soberbios; quiero decir: acorrer a los
miserables y destruir a los rigurosos.
— No es menester —respondió el duque— que vuesa merced se ponga en trabajo
de buscar al rústico de quien esta buena dueña se queja, ni es menester
tampoco que vuesa merced me pida a mí licencia para desafiarle; que yo le
doy por desafiado, y tomo a mi cargo de hacerle saber este desafío, y que
le acete, y venga a responder por sí a este mi castillo, donde a entrambos
daré campo seguro, guardando todas las condiciones que en tales actos
suelen y deben guardarse, guardando igualmente su justicia a cada uno, como
están obligados a guardarla todos aquellos príncipes que dan campo franco a
los que se combaten en los términos de sus señoríos.
— Pues con ese seguro y con buena licencia de vuestra grandeza —replicó don
Quijote—, desde aquí digo que por esta vez renuncio a mi hidalguía, y me
allano y ajusto con la llaneza del dañador, y me hago igual con él,
habilitándole para poder combatir conmigo; y así, aunque ausente, le
desafío y repto, en razón de que hizo mal en defraudar a esta pobre, que
fue doncella y ya por su culpa no lo es, y que le ha de cumplir la palabra
que le dio de ser su legítimo esposo, o morir en la demanda.
Y luego, descalzándose un guante, le arrojó en mitad de la sala, y el duque
le alzó, diciendo que, como ya había dicho, él acetaba el tal desafío en
nombre de su vasallo, y señalaba el plazo de allí a seis días; y el campo,
en la plaza de aquel castillo; y las armas, las acostumbradas de los
caballeros: lanza y escudo, y arnés tranzado, con todas las demás piezas,
sin engaño, superchería o superstición alguna, examinadas y vistas por los
jueces del campo.
— Pero, ante todas cosas, es menester que esta buena dueña y esta mala
doncella pongan el derecho de su justicia en manos del señor don Quijote;
que de otra manera no se hará nada, ni llegará a debida ejecución el tal
desafío.
— Yo sí pongo —respondió la dueña.
— Y yo también —añadió la hija, toda llorosa y toda vergonzosa y de mal
talante.
Tomado, pues, este apuntamiento, y habiendo imaginado el duque lo que había
de hacer en el caso, las enlutadas se fueron, y ordenó la duquesa que de
allí adelante no las tratasen como a sus criadas, sino como a señoras
aventureras que venían a pedir justicia a su casa; y así, les dieron cuarto
aparte y las sirvieron como a forasteras, no sin espanto de las demás
criadas, que no sabían en qué había de parar la sandez y desenvoltura de
doña Rodríguez y de su malandante hija.
Estando en esto, para acabar de regocijar la fiesta y dar buen fin a la
comida, veis aquí donde entró por la sala el paje que llevó las cartas y
presentes a Teresa Panza, mujer del gobernador Sancho Panza, de cuya
llegada recibieron gran contento los duques, deseosos de saber lo que le
había sucedido en su viaje; y, preguntándoselo, respondió el paje que no lo
podía decir tan en público ni con breves palabras: que sus excelencias
fuesen servidos de dejarlo para a solas, y que entretanto se entretuviesen
con aquellas cartas. Y, sacando dos cartas, las puso en manos de la
duquesa. La una decía en el sobreescrito: Carta para mi señora la duquesa
tal, de no sé dónde, y la otra: A mi marido Sancho Panza, gobernador de la
ínsula Barataria, que Dios prospere más años que a mí. No se le cocía el
pan, como suele decirse, a la duquesa hasta leer su carta, y abriéndola y
leído para sí, y viendo que la podía leer en voz alta para que el duque y
los circunstantes la oyesen, leyó desta manera:
Carta de Teresa Panza a la Duquesa
Mucho contento me dio, señora mía, la carta que vuesa grandeza me escribió,
que en verdad que la tenía bien deseada. La sarta de corales es muy buena,
y el vestido de caza de mi marido no le va en zaga. De que vuestra señoría
haya hecho gobernador a Sancho, mi consorte, ha recebido mucho gusto todo
este lugar, puesto que no hay quien lo crea, principalmente el cura, y mase
Nicolás el barbero, y Sansón Carrasco el bachiller; pero a mí no se me da
nada; que, como ello sea así, como lo es, diga cada uno lo que quisiere;
aunque, si va a decir verdad, a no venir los corales y el vestido, tampoco
yo lo creyera, porque en este pueblo todos tienen a mi marido por un porro,
y que, sacado de gobernar un hato de cabras, no pueden imaginar para qué
gobierno pueda ser bueno. Dios lo haga, y lo encamine como vee que lo han
menester sus hijos.
Yo, señora de mi alma, estoy determinada, con licencia de vuesa merced, de
meter este buen día en mi casa, yéndome a la corte a tenderme en un coche,
para quebrar los ojos a mil envidiosos que ya tengo; y así, suplico a vuesa
excelencia mande a mi marido me envíe algún dinerillo, y que sea algo qué,
porque en la corte son los gastos grandes: que el pan vale a real, y la
carne, la libra, a treinta maravedís, que es un juicio; y si quisiere que
no vaya, que me lo avise con tiempo, porque me están bullendo los pies por
ponerme en camino; que me dicen mis amigas y mis vecinas que, si yo y mi
hija andamos orondas y pomposas en la corte, vendrá a ser conocido mi
marido por mí más que yo por él, siendo forzoso que pregunten muchos:
''—¿Quién son estas señoras deste coche?'' Y un criado mío responder: ''—La
mujer y la hija de Sancho Panza, gobernador de la ínsula Barataria''; y
desta manera será conocido Sancho, y yo seré estimada, y a Roma por todo.
Pésame, cuanto pesarme puede, que este año no se han cogido bellotas en
este pueblo; con todo eso, envío a vuesa alteza hasta medio celemín, que
una a una las fui yo a coger y a escoger al monte, y no las hallé más
mayores; yo quisiera que fueran como huevos de avestruz.
No se le olvide a vuestra pomposidad de escribirme, que yo tendré cuidado
de la respuesta, avisando de mi salud y de todo lo que hubiere que avisar
deste lugar, donde quedo rogando a Nuestro Señor guarde a vuestra grandeza,
y a mí no olvide. Sancha, mi hija, y mi hijo besan a vuestra merced las
manos.
La que tiene más deseo de ver a vuestra señoría que de escribirla, su
criada,
Teresa Panza.
Grande fue el gusto que todos recibieron de oír la carta de Teresa Panza,
principalmente los duques, y la duquesa pidió parecer a don Quijote si
sería bien abrir la carta que venía para el gobernador, que imaginaba debía
de ser bonísima. Don Quijote dijo que él la abriría por darles gusto, y así
lo hizo, y vio que decía desta manera:
Carta de Teresa Panza a Sancho Panza su marido
Tu carta recibí, Sancho mío de mi alma, y yo te prometo y juro como
católica cristiana que no faltaron dos dedos para volverme loca de
contento. Mira, hermano: cuando yo llegué a oír que eres gobernador, me
pensé allí caer muerta de puro gozo, que ya sabes tú que dicen que así mata
la alegría súbita como el dolor grande. A Sanchica, tu hija, se le fueron
las aguas sin sentirlo, de puro contento. El vestido que me enviaste tenía
delante, y los corales que me envió mi señora la duquesa al cuello, y las
cartas en las manos, y el portador dellas allí presente, y, con todo eso,
creía y pensaba que era todo sueño lo que veía y lo que tocaba; porque,
¿quién podía pensar que un pastor de cabras había de venir a ser gobernador
de ínsulas? Ya sabes tú, amigo, que decía mi madre que era menester vivir
mucho para ver mucho: dígolo porque pienso ver más si vivo más; porque no
pienso parar hasta verte arrendador o alcabalero, que son oficios que,
aunque lleva el diablo a quien mal los usa, en fin en fin, siempre tienen y
manejan dineros. Mi señora la duquesa te dirá el deseo que tengo de ir a la
corte; mírate en ello, y avísame de tu gusto, que yo procuraré honrarte en
ella andando en coche.
El cura, el barbero, el bachiller y aun el sacristán no pueden creer que
eres gobernador, y dicen que todo es embeleco, o cosas de encantamento,
como son todas las de don Quijote tu amo; y dice Sansón que ha de ir a
buscarte y a sacarte el gobierno de la cabeza, y a don Quijote la locura de
los cascos; yo no hago sino reírme, y mirar mi sarta, y dar traza del
vestido que tengo de hacer del tuyo a nuestra hija.
Unas bellotas envié a mi señora la duquesa; yo quisiera que fueran de oro.
Envíame tú algunas sartas de perlas, si se usan en esa ínsula.
Las nuevas deste lugar son que la Berrueca casó a su hija con un pintor de
mala mano, que llegó a este pueblo a pintar lo que saliese; mandóle el
Concejo pintar las armas de Su Majestad sobre las puertas del Ayuntamiento,
pidió dos ducados, diéronselos adelantados, trabajó ocho días, al cabo de
los cuales no pintó nada, y dijo que no acertaba a pintar tantas baratijas;
volvió el dinero, y, con todo eso, se casó a título de buen oficial; verdad
es que ya ha dejado el pincel y tomado el azada, y va al campo como
gentilhombre. El hijo de Pedro de Lobo se ha ordenado de grados y corona,
con intención de hacerse clérigo; súpolo Minguilla, la nieta de Mingo
Silvato, y hale puesto demanda de que la tiene dada palabra de casamiento;
malas lenguas quieren decir que ha estado encinta dél, pero él lo niega a
pies juntillas.
Hogaño no hay aceitunas, ni se halla una gota de vinagre en todo este
pueblo. Por aquí pasó una compañía de soldados; lleváronse de camino tres
mozas deste pueblo; no te quiero decir quién son: quizá volverán, y no
faltará quien las tome por mujeres, con sus tachas buenas o malas.
Sanchica hace puntas de randas; gana cada día ocho maravedís horros, que
los va echando en una alcancía para ayuda a su ajuar; pero ahora que es
hija de un gobernador, tú le darás la dote sin que ella lo trabaje. La
fuente de la plaza se secó; un rayo cayó en la picota, y allí me las den
todas.
Espero respuesta désta y la resolución de mi ida a la corte; y, con esto,
Dios te me guarde más años que a mí o tantos, porque no querría dejarte sin
mí en este mundo.
Tu mujer,
Teresa Panza.
Las cartas fueron solenizadas, reídas, estimadas y admiradas; y, para
acabar de echar el sello, llegó el correo, el que traía la que Sancho
enviaba a don Quijote, que asimesmo se leyó públicamente, la cual puso en
duda la sandez del gobernador.
Retiróse la duquesa, para saber del paje lo que le había sucedido en el
lugar de Sancho, el cual se lo contó muy por estenso, sin dejar
circunstancia que no refiriese; diole las bellotas, y más un queso que
Teresa le dio, por ser muy bueno, que se aventajaba a los de Tronchón
Recibiólo la duquesa con grandísimo gusto, con el cual la dejaremos, por
contar el fin que tuvo el gobierno del gran Sancho Panza, flor y espejo de
todos los insulanos gobernadores.
Capítulo LIII. Del fatigado fin y remate que tuvo el gobierno de Sancho
Panza
''Pensar que en esta vida las cosas della han de durar siempre en un estado
es pensar en lo escusado; antes parece que ella anda todo en redondo, digo,
a la redonda: la primavera sigue al verano, el verano al estío, el estío al
otoño, y el otoño al invierno, y el invierno a la primavera, y así torna a
andarse el tiempo con esta rueda continua; sola la vida humana corre a su
fin ligera más que el tiempo, sin esperar renovarse si no es en la otra,
que no tiene términos que la limiten''. Esto dice Cide Hamete, filósofo
mahomético; porque esto de entender la ligereza e instabilidad de la vida
presente, y de la duración de la eterna que se espera, muchos sin lumbre de
fe, sino con la luz natural, lo han entendido; pero aquí, nuestro autor lo
dice por la presteza con que se acabó, se consumió, se deshizo, se fue como
en sombra y humo el gobierno de Sancho.
El cual, estando la séptima noche de los días de su gobierno en su cama, no
harto de pan ni de vino, sino de juzgar y dar pareceres y de hacer
estatutos y pragmáticas, cuando el sueño, a despecho y pesar de la hambre,
le comenzaba a cerrar los párpados, oyó tan gran ruido de campanas y de
voces, que no parecía sino que toda la ínsula se hundía. Sentóse en la
cama, y estuvo atento y escuchando, por ver si daba en la cuenta de lo que
podía ser la causa de tan grande alboroto; pero no sólo no lo supo, pero,
añadiéndose al ruido de voces y campanas el de infinitas trompetas y
atambores, quedó más confuso y lleno de temor y espanto; y, levantándose en
pie, se puso unas chinelas, por la humedad del suelo, y, sin ponerse
sobrerropa de levantar, ni cosa que se pareciese, salió a la puerta de su
aposento, a tiempo cuando vio venir por unos corredores más de veinte
personas con hachas encendidas en las manos y con las espadas
desenvainadas, gritando todos a grandes voces:
— ¡Arma, arma, señor gobernador, arma!; que han entrado infinitos enemigos
en la ínsula, y somos perdidos si vuestra industria y valor no nos socorre.
Con este ruido, furia y alboroto llegaron donde Sancho estaba, atónito y
embelesado de lo que oía y veía; y, cuando llegaron a él, uno le dijo:
— ¡Ármese luego vuestra señoría, si no quiere perderse y que toda esta
ínsula se pierda!
— ¿Qué me tengo de armar —respondió Sancho—, ni qué sé yo de armas ni de
socorros? Estas cosas mejor será dejarlas para mi amo don Quijote, que en
dos paletas las despachará y pondrá en cobro; que yo, pecador fui a Dios,
no se me entiende nada destas priesas.
— ¡Ah, señor gobernador! —dijo otro—. ¿Qué relente es ése? Ármese vuesa
merced, que aquí le traemos armas ofensivas y defensivas, y salga a esa
plaza, y sea nuestra guía y nuestro capitán, pues de derecho le toca el
serlo, siendo nuestro gobernador.
— Ármenme norabuena —replicó Sancho.
Y al momento le trujeron dos paveses, que venían proveídos dellos, y le
pusieron encima de la camisa, sin dejarle tomar otro vestido, un pavés
delante y otro detrás, y, por unas concavidades que traían hechas, le
sacaron los brazos, y le liaron muy bien con unos cordeles, de modo que
quedó emparedado y entablado, derecho como un huso, sin poder doblar las
rodillas ni menearse un solo paso. Pusiéronle en las manos una lanza, a la
cual se arrimó para poder tenerse en pie. Cuando así le tuvieron, le
dijeron que caminase, y los guiase y animase a todos; que, siendo él su
norte, su lanterna y su lucero, tendrían buen fin sus negocios.
— ¿Cómo tengo de caminar, desventurado yo —respondió Sancho—, que no puedo
jugar las choquezuelas de las rodillas, porque me lo impiden estas tablas
que tan cosidas tengo con mis carnes? Lo que han de hacer es llevarme en
brazos y ponerme, atravesado o en pie, en algún postigo, que yo le
guardaré, o con esta lanza o con mi cuerpo.
— Ande, señor gobernador —dijo otro—, que más el miedo que las tablas le
impiden el paso; acabe y menéese, que es tarde, y los enemigos crecen, y
las voces se aumentan y el peligro carga.
Por cuyas persuasiones y vituperios probó el pobre gobernador a moverse, y
fue dar consigo en el suelo tan gran golpe, que pensó que se había hecho
pedazos. Quedó como galápago encerrado y cubierto con sus conchas, o como
medio tocino metido entre dos artesas, o bien así como barca que da al
través en la arena; y no por verle caído aquella gente burladora le
tuvieron compasión alguna; antes, apagando las antorchas, tornaron a
reforzar las voces, y a reiterar el ¡arma! con tan gran priesa, pasando por
encima del pobre Sancho, dándole infinitas cuchilladas sobre los paveses,
que si él no se recogiera y encogiera, metiendo la cabeza entre los
paveses, lo pasara muy mal el pobre gobernador, el cual, en aquella
estrecheza recogido, sudaba y trasudaba, y de todo corazón se encomendaba a
Dios que de aquel peligro le sacase.
Unos tropezaban en él, otros caían, y tal hubo que se puso encima un buen
espacio, y desde allí, como desde atalaya, gobernaba los ejércitos, y a
grandes voces decía:
— ¡Aquí de los nuestros, que por esta parte cargan más los enemigos! ¡Aquel
portillo se guarde, aquella puerta se cierre, aquellas escalas se tranquen!
¡Vengan alcancías, pez y resina en calderas de aceite ardiendo!
¡Trinchéense las calles con colchones!
En fin, él nombraba con todo ahínco todas las baratijas e instrumentos y
pertrechos de guerra con que suele defenderse el asalto de una ciudad, y el
molido Sancho, que lo escuchaba y sufría todo, decía entre sí:
— ¡Oh, si mi Señor fuese servido que se acabase ya de perder esta ínsula, y
me viese yo o muerto o fuera desta grande angustia!
Oyó el cielo su petición, y, cuando menos lo esperaba, oyó voces que
decían:
— ¡Vitoria, vitoria! ¡Los enemigos van de vencida! ¡Ea, señor gobernador,
levántese vuesa merced y venga a gozar del vencimiento y a repartir los
despojos que se han tomado a los enemigos, por el valor dese invencible
brazo!
— Levántenme —dijo con voz doliente el dolorido Sancho.
Ayudáronle a levantar, y, puesto en pie, dijo:
— El enemigo que yo hubiere vencido quiero que me le claven en la frente. Yo
no quiero repartir despojos de enemigos, sino pedir y suplicar a algún
amigo, si es que le tengo, que me dé un trago de vino, que me seco, y me
enjugue este sudor, que me hago agua.
Limpiáronle, trujéronle el vino, desliáronle los paveses, sentóse sobre su
lecho y desmayóse del temor, del sobresalto y del trabajo. Ya les pesaba a
los de la burla de habérsela hecho tan pesada; pero el haber vuelto en sí
Sancho les templó la pena que les había dado su desmayo. Preguntó qué hora
era, respondiéronle que ya amanecía. Calló, y, sin decir otra cosa, comenzó
a vestirse, todo sepultado en silencio, y todos le miraban y esperaban en
qué había de parar la priesa con que se vestía. Vistióse, en fin, y poco a
poco, porque estaba molido y no podía ir mucho a mucho, se fue a la
caballeriza, siguiéndole todos los que allí se hallaban, y, llegándose al
rucio, le abrazó y le dio un beso de paz en la frente, y, no sin lágrimas
en los ojos, le dijo:
— Venid vos acá, compañero mío y amigo mío, y conllevador de mis trabajos y
miserias: cuando yo me avenía con vos y no tenía otros pensamientos que los
que me daban los cuidados de remendar vuestros aparejos y de sustentar
vuestro corpezuelo, dichosas eran mis horas, mis días y mis años; pero,
después que os dejé y me subí sobre las torres de la ambición y de la
soberbia, se me han entrado por el alma adentro mil miserias, mil trabajos
y cuatro mil desasosiegos.
Y, en tanto que estas razones iba diciendo, iba asimesmo enalbardando el
asno, sin que nadie nada le dijese. Enalbardado, pues, el rucio, con gran
pena y pesar subió sobre él, y, encaminando sus palabras y razones al
mayordomo, al secretario, al maestresala y a Pedro Recio el doctor, y a
otros muchos que allí presentes estaban, dijo:
— Abrid camino, señores míos, y dejadme volver a mi antigua libertad;
dejadme que vaya a buscar la vida pasada, para que me resucite de esta
muerte presente. Yo no nací para ser gobernador, ni para defender ínsulas
ni ciudades de los enemigos que quisieren acometerlas. Mejor se me entiende
a mí de arar y cavar, podar y ensarmentar las viñas, que de dar leyes ni de
defender provincias ni reinos. Bien se está San Pedro en Roma: quiero
decir, que bien se está cada uno usando el oficio para que fue nacido.
Mejor me está a mí una hoz en la mano que un cetro de gobernador; más
quiero hartarme de gazpachos que estar sujeto a la miseria de un médico
impertinente que me mate de hambre; y más quiero recostarme a la sombra de
una encina en el verano y arroparme con un zamarro de dos pelos en el
invierno, en mi libertad, que acostarme con la sujeción del gobierno entre
sábanas de holanda y vestirme de martas cebollinas. Vuestras mercedes se
queden con Dios, y digan al duque mi señor que, desnudo nací, desnudo me
hallo: ni pierdo ni gano; quiero decir, que sin blanca entré en este
gobierno y sin ella salgo, bien al revés de como suelen salir los
gobernadores de otras ínsulas. Y apártense: déjenme ir, que me voy a
bizmar; que creo que tengo brumadas todas las costillas, merced a los
enemigos que esta noche se han paseado sobre mí.
— No ha de ser así, señor gobernador —dijo el doctor Recio—, que yo le daré
a vuesa merced una bebida contra caídas y molimientos, que luego le vuelva
en su prístina entereza y vigor; y, en lo de la comida, yo prometo a vuesa
merced de enmendarme, dejándole comer abundantemente de todo aquello que
quisiere.
— ¡Tarde piache! —respondió Sancho—. Así dejaré de irme como volverme turco.
No son estas burlas para dos veces. Por Dios que así me quede en éste, ni
admita otro gobierno, aunque me le diesen entre dos platos, como volar al
cielo sin alas. Yo soy del linaje de los Panzas, que todos son testarudos,
y si una vez dicen nones, nones han de ser, aunque sean pares, a pesar de
todo el mundo. Quédense en esta caballeriza las alas de la hormiga, que me
levantaron en el aire para que me comiesen vencejos y otros pájaros, y
volvámonos a andar por el suelo con pie llano, que, si no le adornaren
zapatos picados de cordobán, no le faltarán alpargatas toscas de cuerda.
Cada oveja con su pareja, y nadie tienda más la pierna de cuanto fuere
larga la sábana; y déjenme pasar, que se me hace tarde.
A lo que el mayordomo dijo:
— Señor gobernador, de muy buena gana dejáramos ir a vuesa merced, puesto
que nos pesará mucho de perderle, que su ingenio y su cristiano proceder
obligan a desearle; pero ya se sabe que todo gobernador está obligado,
antes que se ausente de la parte donde ha gobernado, dar primero
residencia: déla vuesa merced de los diez días que ha que tiene el
gobierno, y váyase a la paz de Dios.
— Nadie me la puede pedir —respondió Sancho—, si no es quien ordenare el
duque mi señor; yo voy a verme con él, y a él se la daré de molde; cuanto
más que, saliendo yo desnudo, como salgo, no es menester otra señal para
dar a entender que he gobernado como un ángel.
— Par Dios que tiene razón el gran Sancho —dijo el doctor Recio—, y que soy
de parecer que le dejemos ir, porque el duque ha de gustar infinito de
verle.
Todos vinieron en ello, y le dejaron ir, ofreciéndole primero compañía y
todo aquello que quisiese para el regalo de su persona y para la comodidad
de su viaje. Sancho dijo que no quería más de un poco de cebada para el
rucio y medio queso y medio pan para él; que, pues el camino era tan corto,
no había menester mayor ni mejor repostería. Abrazáronle todos, y él,
llorando, abrazó a todos, y los dejó admirados, así de sus razones como de
su determinación tan resoluta y tan discreta.
Capítulo LIV. Que trata de cosas tocantes a esta historia, y no a otra
alguna
Resolviéronse el duque y la duquesa de que el desafío que don Quijote hizo
a su vasallo, por la causa ya referida, pasase adelante; y, puesto que el
mozo estaba en Flandes, adonde se había ido huyendo, por no tener por
suegra a doña Rodríguez, ordenaron de poner en su lugar a un lacayo gascón,
que se llamaba Tosilos, industriándole primero muy bien de todo lo que
había de hacer.
De allí a dos días dijo el duque a don Quijote como desde allí a cuatro
vendría su contrario, y se presentaría en el campo, armado como caballero,
y sustentaría como la doncella mentía por mitad de la barba, y aun por toda
la barba entera, si se afirmaba que él le hubiese dado palabra de
casamiento. Don Quijote recibió mucho gusto con las tales nuevas, y se
prometió a sí mismo de hacer maravillas en el caso, y tuvo a gran ventura
habérsele ofrecido ocasión donde aquellos señores pudiesen ver hasta dónde
se estendía el valor de su poderoso brazo; y así, con alborozo y contento,
esperaba los cuatro días, que se le iban haciendo, a la cuenta de su deseo,
cuatrocientos siglos.
Dejémoslos pasar nosotros, como dejamos pasar otras cosas, y vamos a
acompañar a Sancho, que entre alegre y triste venía caminando sobre el
rucio a buscar a su amo, cuya compañía le agradaba más que ser gobernador
de todas las ínsulas del mundo.
Sucedió, pues, que, no habiéndose alongado mucho de la ínsula del su
gobierno —que él nunca se puso a averiguar si era ínsula, ciudad, villa o
lugar la que gobernaba—, vio que por el camino por donde él iba venían seis
peregrinos con sus bordones, de estos estranjeros que piden la limosna
cantando, los cuales, en llegando a él, se pusieron en ala, y, levantando
las voces todos juntos, comenzaron a cantar en su lengua lo que Sancho no
pudo entender, si no fue una palabra que claramente pronunciaba limosna,
por donde entendió que era limosna la que en su canto pedían; y como él,
según dice Cide Hamete, era caritativo además, sacó de sus alforjas medio
pan y medio queso, de que venía proveído, y dióselo, diciéndoles por señas
que no tenía otra cosa que darles. Ellos lo recibieron de muy buena gana, y
dijeron:
— ¡Guelte! ¡Guelte!
— No entiendo —respondió Sancho— qué es lo que me pedís, buena gente.
Entonces uno de ellos sacó una bolsa del seno y mostrósela a Sancho, por
donde entendió que le pedían dineros; y él, poniéndose el dedo pulgar en la
garganta y estendiendo la mano arriba, les dio a entender que no tenía
ostugo de moneda, y, picando al rucio, rompió por ellos; y, al pasar,
habiéndole estado mirando uno dellos con mucha atención, arremetió a él,
echándole los brazos por la cintura; en voz alta y muy castellana, dijo:
— ¡Válame Dios! ¿Qué es lo que veo? ¿Es posible que tengo en mis brazos al
mi caro amigo, al mi buen vecino Sancho Panza? Sí tengo, sin duda, porque
yo ni duermo, ni estoy ahora borracho.
Admiróse Sancho de verse nombrar por su nombre y de verse abrazar del
estranjero peregrino, y, después de haberle estado mirando sin hablar
palabra, con mucha atención, nunca pudo conocerle; pero, viendo su
suspensión el peregrino, le dijo:
— ¿Cómo, y es posible, Sancho Panza hermano, que no conoces a tu vecino
Ricote el morisco, tendero de tu lugar?
Entonces Sancho le miró con más atención y comenzó a rafigurarle, y ,
finalmente, le vino a conocer de todo punto, y, sin apearse del jumento, le
echó los brazos al cuello, y le dijo:
— ¿Quién diablos te había de conocer, Ricote, en ese traje de moharracho que
traes? Dime: ¿quién te ha hecho franchote, y cómo tienes atrevimiento de
volver a España, donde si te cogen y conocen tendrás harta mala ventura?
— Si tú no me descubres, Sancho —respondió el peregrino—, seguro estoy que
en este traje no habrá nadie que me conozca; y apartémonos del camino a
aquella alameda que allí parece, donde quieren comer y reposar mis
compañeros, y allí comerás con ellos, que son muy apacible gente. Yo tendré
lugar de contarte lo que me ha sucedido después que me partí de nuestro
lugar, por obedecer el bando de Su Majestad, que con tanto rigor a los
desdichados de mi nación amenazaba, según oíste.
Hízolo así Sancho, y, hablando Ricote a los demás peregrinos, se apartaron
a la alameda que se parecía, bien desviados del camino real. Arrojaron los
bordones, quitáronse las mucetas o esclavinas y quedaron en pelota, y todos
ellos eran mozos y muy gentileshombres, excepto Ricote, que ya era hombre
entrado en años. Todos traían alforjas, y todas, según pareció, venían bien
proveídas, a lo menos, de cosas incitativas y que llaman a la sed de dos
leguas.
Tendiéronse en el suelo, y, haciendo manteles de las yerbas, pusieron sobre
ellas pan, sal, cuchillos, nueces, rajas de queso, huesos mondos de jamón,
que si no se dejaban mascar, no defendían el ser chupados. Pusieron
asimismo un manjar negro que dicen que se llama cavial, y es hecho de
huevos de pescados, gran despertador de la colambre. No faltaron aceitunas,
aunque secas y sin adobo alguno, pero sabrosas y entretenidas. Pero lo que
más campeó en el campo de aquel banquete fueron seis botas de vino, que
cada uno sacó la suya de su alforja; hasta el buen Ricote, que se había
transformado de morisco en alemán o en tudesco, sacó la suya, que en
grandeza podía competir con las cinco.
Comenzaron a comer con grandísimo gusto y muy de espacio, saboreándose con
cada bocado, que le tomaban con la punta del cuchillo, y muy poquito de
cada cosa, y luego, al punto, todos a una, levantaron los brazos y las
botas en el aire; puestas las bocas en su boca, clavados los ojos en el
cielo, no parecía sino que ponían en él la puntería; y desta manera,
meneando las cabezas a un lado y a otro, señales que acreditaban el gusto
que recebían, se estuvieron un buen espacio, trasegando en sus estómagos
las entrañas de las vasijas.
Todo lo miraba Sancho, y de ninguna cosa se dolía; antes, por cumplir con
el refrán, que él muy bien sabía, de "cuando a Roma fueres, haz como
vieres", pidió a Ricote la bota, y tomó su puntería como los demás, y no
con menos gusto que ellos.
Cuatro veces dieron lugar las botas para ser empinadas; pero la quinta no
fue posible, porque ya estaban más enjutas y secas que un esparto, cosa que
puso mustia la alegría que hasta allí habían mostrado. De cuando en cuando,
juntaba alguno su mano derecha con la de Sancho, y decía:
— Español y tudesqui, tuto uno: bon compaño.
Y Sancho respondía: Bon compaño, jura Di!
Y disparaba con una risa que le duraba un hora, sin acordarse entonces de
nada de lo que le había sucedido en su gobierno; porque sobre el rato y
tiempo cuando se come y bebe, poca jurisdición suelen tener los cuidados.
Finalmente, el acabársele el vino fue principio de un sueño que dio a
todos, quedándose dormidos sobre las mismas mesas y manteles; solos Ricote
y Sancho quedaron alerta, porque habían comido más y bebido menos; y,
apartando Ricote a Sancho, se sentaron al pie de una haya, dejando a los
peregrinos sepultados en dulce sueño; y Ricote, sin tropezar nada en su
lengua morisca, en la pura castellana le dijo las siguientes razones:
— «Bien sabes, ¡oh Sancho Panza, vecino y amigo mío!, como el pregón y bando
que Su Majestad mandó publicar contra los de mi nación puso terror y
espanto en todos nosotros; a lo menos, en mí le puso de suerte que me
parece que antes del tiempo que se nos concedía para que hiciésemos
ausencia de España, ya tenía el rigor de la pena ejecutado en mi persona y
en la de mis hijos. Ordené, pues, a mi parecer como prudente, bien así como
el que sabe que para tal tiempo le han de quitar la casa donde vive y se
provee de otra donde mudarse; ordené, digo, de salir yo solo, sin mi
familia, de mi pueblo, y ir a buscar donde llevarla con comodidad y sin la
priesa con que los demás salieron; porque bien vi, y vieron todos nuestros
ancianos, que aquellos pregones no eran sólo amenazas, como algunos decían,
sino verdaderas leyes, que se habían de poner en ejecución a su determinado
tiempo; y forzábame a creer esta verdad saber yo los ruines y disparatados
intentos que los nuestros tenían, y tales, que me parece que fue
inspiración divina la que movió a Su Majestad a poner en efecto tan
gallarda resolución, no porque todos fuésemos culpados, que algunos había
cristianos firmes y verdaderos; pero eran tan pocos que no se podían oponer
a los que no lo eran, y no era bien criar la sierpe en el seno, teniendo
los enemigos dentro de casa. Finalmente, con justa razón fuimos castigados
con la pena del destierro, blanda y suave al parecer de algunos, pero al
nuestro, la más terrible que se nos podía dar. Doquiera que estamos
lloramos por España, que, en fin, nacimos en ella y es nuestra patria
natural; en ninguna parte hallamos el acogimiento que nuestra desventura
desea, y en Berbería, y en todas las partes de África, donde esperábamos
ser recebidos, acogidos y regalados, allí es donde más nos ofenden y
maltratan. No hemos conocido el bien hasta que le hemos perdido; y es el
deseo tan grande, que casi todos tenemos de volver a España, que los más de
aquellos, y son muchos, que saben la lengua como yo, se vuelven a ella, y
dejan allá sus mujeres y sus hijos desamparados: tanto es el amor que la
tienen; y agora conozco y experimento lo que suele decirse: que es dulce el
amor de la patria. Salí, como digo, de nuestro pueblo, entré en Francia, y,
aunque allí nos hacían buen acogimiento, quise verlo todo. Pasé a Italia y
llegué a Alemania, y allí me pareció que se podía vivir con más libertad,
porque sus habitadores no miran en muchas delicadezas: cada uno vive como
quiere, porque en la mayor parte della se vive con libertad de conciencia.
Dejé tomada casa en un pueblo junto a Augusta; juntéme con estos
peregrinos, que tienen por costumbre de venir a España muchos dellos, cada
año, a visitar los santuarios della, que los tienen por sus Indias, y por
certísima granjería y conocida ganancia. Ándanla casi toda, y no hay pueblo
ninguno de donde no salgan comidos y bebidos, como suele decirse, y con un
real, por lo menos, en dineros, y al cabo de su viaje salen con más de cien
escudos de sobra que, trocados en oro, o ya en el hueco de los bordones, o
entre los remiendos de las esclavinas, o con la industria que ellos pueden,
los sacan del reino y los pasan a sus tierras, a pesar de las guardas de
los puestos y puertos donde se registran. Ahora es mi intención, Sancho,
sacar el tesoro que dejé enterrado, que por estar fuera del pueblo lo podré
hacer sin peligro y escribir o pasar desde Valencia a mi hija y a mi mujer,
que sé que está en Argel, y dar traza como traerlas a algún puerto de
Francia, y desde allí llevarlas a Alemania, donde esperaremos lo que Dios
quisiere hacer de nosotros; que, en resolución, Sancho, yo sé cierto que la
Ricota mi hija y Francisca Ricota, mi mujer, son católicas cristianas, y,
aunque yo no lo soy tanto, todavía tengo más de cristiano que de moro, y
ruego siempre a Dios me abra los ojos del entendimiento y me dé a conocer
cómo le tengo de servir. Y lo que me tiene admirado es no saber por qué se
fue mi mujer y mi hija antes a Berbería que a Francia, adonde podía vivir
como cristiana.»
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— Mira, Ricote, eso no debió estar en su mano, porque las llevó Juan
Tiopieyo, el hermano de tu mujer; y, como debe de ser fino moro, fuese a lo
más bien parado, y séte decir otra cosa: que creo que vas en balde a buscar
lo que dejaste encerrado; porque tuvimos nuevas que habían quitado a tu
cuñado y tu mujer muchas perlas y mucho dinero en oro que llevaban por
registrar.
— Bien puede ser eso —replicó Ricote—, pero yo sé, Sancho, que no tocaron a
mi encierro, porque yo no les descubrí dónde estaba, temeroso de algún
desmán; y así, si tú, Sancho, quieres venir conmigo y ayudarme a sacarlo y
a encubrirlo, yo te daré docientos escudos, con que podrás remediar tus
necesidades, que ya sabes que sé yo que las tienes muchas.
— Yo lo hiciera —respondió Sancho—, pero no soy nada codicioso; que, a
serlo, un oficio dejé yo esta mañana de las manos, donde pudiera hacer las
paredes de mi casa de oro, y comer antes de seis meses en platos de plata;
y, así por esto como por parecerme haría traición a mi rey en dar favor a
sus enemigos, no fuera contigo, si como me prometes docientos escudos, me
dieras aquí de contado cuatrocientos.
— Y ¿qué oficio es el que has dejado, Sancho? —preguntó Ricote.
— He dejado de ser gobernador de una ínsula —respondió Sancho—, y tal, que a
buena fee que no hallen otra como ella a tres tirones.
— ¿Y dónde está esa ínsula? —preguntó Ricote.
— ¿Adónde? —respondió Sancho—. Dos leguas de aquí, y se llama la ínsula
Barataria.
— Calla, Sancho —dijo Ricote—, que las ínsulas están allá dentro de la mar;
que no hay ínsulas en la tierra firme.
— ¿Cómo no? —replicó Sancho—. Dígote, Ricote amigo, que esta mañana me partí
della, y ayer estuve en ella gobernando a mi placer, como un sagitario;
pero, con todo eso, la he dejado, por parecerme oficio peligroso el de los
gobernadores.
— Y ¿qué has ganado en el gobierno? —preguntó Ricote.
— He ganado —respondió Sancho— el haber conocido que no soy bueno para
gobernar, si no es un hato de ganado, y que las riquezas que se ganan en
los tales gobiernos son a costa de perder el descanso y el sueño, y aun el
sustento; porque en las ínsulas deben de comer poco los gobernadores,
especialmente si tienen médicos que miren por su salud.
— Yo no te entiendo, Sancho —dijo Ricote—, pero paréceme que todo lo que
dices es disparate; que, ¿quién te había de dar a ti ínsulas que
gobernases? ¿Faltaban hombres en el mundo más hábiles para gobernadores que
tú eres? Calla, Sancho, y vuelve en ti, y mira si quieres venir conmigo,
como te he dicho, a ayudarme a sacar el tesoro que dejé escondido; que en
verdad que es tanto, que se puede llamar tesoro, y te daré con que vivas,
como te he dicho.
— Ya te he dicho, Ricote —replicó Sancho—, que no quiero; conténtate que por
mí no serás descubierto, y prosigue en buena hora tu camino, y déjame
seguir el mío; que yo sé que lo bien ganado se pierde, y lo malo, ello y su
dueño.
— No quiero porfiar, Sancho —dijo Ricote—, pero dime: ¿hallástete en nuestro
lugar, cuando se partió dél mi mujer, mi hija y mi cuñado?
— Sí hallé —respondió Sancho—, y séte decir que salió tu hija tan hermosa
que salieron a verla cuantos había en el pueblo, y todos decían que era la
más bella criatura del mundo. Iba llorando y abrazaba a todas sus amigas y
conocidas, y a cuantos llegaban a verla, y a todos pedía la encomendasen a
Dios y a Nuestra Señora su madre; y esto, con tanto sentimiento, que a mí
me hizo llorar, que no suelo ser muy llorón. Y a fee que muchos tuvieron
deseo de esconderla y salir a quitársela en el camino; pero el miedo de ir
contra el mandado del rey los detuvo. Principalmente se mostró más
apasionado don Pedro Gregorio, aquel mancebo mayorazgo rico que tú conoces,
que dicen que la quería mucho, y después que ella se partió, nunca más él
ha parecido en nuestro lugar, y todos pensamos que iba tras ella para
robarla; pero hasta ahora no se ha sabido nada.
— Siempre tuve yo mala sospecha —dijo Ricote— de que ese caballero adamaba a
mi hija; pero, fiado en el valor de mi Ricota, nunca me dio pesadumbre el
saber que la quería bien; que ya habrás oído decir, Sancho, que las
moriscas pocas o ninguna vez se mezclaron por amores con cristianos viejos,
y mi hija, que, a lo que yo creo, atendía a ser más cristiana que
enamorada, no se curaría de las solicitudes de ese señor mayorazgo.
— Dios lo haga —replicó Sancho—, que a entrambos les estaría mal. Y déjame
partir de aquí, Ricote amigo, que quiero llegar esta noche adonde está mi
señor don Quijote.
— Dios vaya contigo, Sancho hermano, que ya mis compañeros se rebullen, y
también es hora que prosigamos nuestro camino.
Y luego se abrazaron los dos, y Sancho subió en su rucio, y Ricote se
arrimó a su bordón, y se apartaron.
Capítulo LV. De cosas sucedidas a Sancho en el camino, y otras que no hay
más que ver
El haberse detenido Sancho con Ricote no le dio lugar a que aquel día
llegase al castillo del duque, puesto que llegó media legua dél, donde le
tomó la noche, algo escura y cerrada; pero, como era verano, no le dio
mucha pesadumbre; y así, se apartó del camino con intención de esperar la
mañana; y quiso su corta y desventurada suerte que, buscando lugar donde
mejor acomodarse, cayeron él y el rucio en una honda y escurísima sima que
entre unos edificios muy antiguos estaba, y al tiempo del caer, se
encomendó a Dios de todo corazón, pensando que no había de parar hasta el
profundo de los abismos. Y no fue así, porque a poco más de tres estados
dio fondo el rucio, y él se halló encima dél, sin haber recebido lisión ni
daño alguno.
Tentóse todo el cuerpo, y recogió el aliento, por ver si estaba sano o
agujereado por alguna parte; y, viéndose bueno, entero y católico de salud,
no se hartaba de dar gracias a Dios Nuestro Señor de la merced que le había
hecho, porque sin duda pensó que estaba hecho mil pedazos. Tentó asimismo
con las manos por las paredes de la sima, por ver si sería posible salir
della sin ayuda de nadie; pero todas las halló rasas y sin asidero alguno,
de lo que Sancho se congojó mucho, especialmente cuando oyó que el rucio se
quejaba tierna y dolorosamente; y no era mucho, ni se lamentaba de vicio,
que, a la verdad, no estaba muy bien parado.
— ¡Ay —dijo entonces Sancho Panza—, y cuán no pensados sucesos suelen
suceder a cada paso a los que viven en este miserable mundo! ¿Quién dijera
que el que ayer se vio entronizado gobernador de una ínsula, mandando a sus
sirvientes y a sus vasallos, hoy se había de ver sepultado en una sima, sin
haber persona alguna que le remedie, ni criado ni vasallo que acuda a su
socorro? Aquí habremos de perecer de hambre yo y mi jumento, si ya no nos
morimos antes, él de molido y quebrantado, y yo de pesaroso. A lo menos, no
seré yo tan venturoso como lo fue mi señor don Quijote de la Mancha cuando
decendió y bajó a la cueva de aquel encantado Montesinos, donde halló quien
le regalase mejor que en su casa, que no parece sino que se fue a mesa
puesta y a cama hecha. Allí vio él visiones hermosas y apacibles, y yo veré
aquí, a lo que creo, sapos y culebras. ¡Desdichado de mí, y en qué han
parado mis locuras y fantasías! De aquí sacarán mis huesos, cuando el cielo
sea servido que me descubran, mondos, blancos y raídos, y los de mi buen
rucio con ellos, por donde quizá se echará de ver quién somos, a lo menos
de los que tuvieren noticia que nunca Sancho Panza se apartó de su asno, ni
su asno de Sancho Panza. Otra vez digo: ¡miserables de nosotros, que no ha
querido nuestra corta suerte que muriésemos en nuestra patria y entre los
nuestros, donde ya que no hallara remedio nuestra desgracia, no faltara
quien dello se doliera, y en la hora última de nuestro pasamiento nos
cerrara los ojos! ¡Oh compañero y amigo mío, qué mal pago te he dado de tus
buenos servicios! Perdóname y pide a la fortuna, en el mejor modo que
supieres, que nos saque deste miserable trabajo en que estamos puestos los
dos; que yo prometo de ponerte una corona de laurel en la cabeza, que no
parezcas sino un laureado poeta, y de darte los piensos doblados.
Desta manera se lamentaba Sancho Panza, y su jumento le escuchaba sin
responderle palabra alguna: tal era el aprieto y angustia en que el pobre
se hallaba. Finalmente, habiendo pasado toda aquella noche en miserables
quejas y lamentaciones, vino el día, con cuya claridad y resplandor vio
Sancho que era imposible de toda imposibilidad salir de aquel pozo sin ser
ayudado, y comenzó a lamentarse y dar voces, por ver si alguno le oía; pero
todas sus voces eran dadas en desierto, pues por todos aquellos contornos
no había persona que pudiese escucharle, y entonces se acabó de dar por
muerto.
Estaba el rucio boca arriba, y Sancho Panza le acomodó de modo que le puso
en pie, que apenas se podía tener; y, sacando de las alforjas, que también
habían corrido la mesma fortuna de la caída, un pedazo de pan, lo dio a su
jumento, que no le supo mal, y díjole Sancho, como si lo entendiera:
— Todos los duelos con pan son buenos.
En esto, descubrió a un lado de la sima un agujero, capaz de caber por él
una persona, si se agobiaba y encogía. Acudió a él Sancho Panza, y,
agazapándose, se entró por él y vio que por de dentro era espacioso y
largo, y púdolo ver, porque por lo que se podía llamar techo entraba un
rayo de sol que lo descubría todo. Vio también que se dilataba y alargaba
por otra concavidad espaciosa; viendo lo cual, volvió a salir adonde estaba
el jumento, y con una piedra comenzó a desmoronar la tierra del agujero, de
modo que en poco espacio hizo lugar donde con facilidad pudiese entrar el
asno, como lo hizo; y, cogiéndole del cabestro, comenzó a caminar por
aquella gruta adelante, por ver si hallaba alguna salida por otra parte. A
veces iba a escuras, y a veces sin luz, pero ninguna vez sin miedo.
— ¡Válame Dios todopoderoso! —decía entre sí—. Esta que para mí es
desventura, mejor fuera para aventura de mi amo don Quijote. Él sí que
tuviera estas profundidades y mazmorras por jardines floridos y por
palacios de Galiana, y esperara salir de esta escuridad y estrecheza a
algún florido prado; pero yo, sin ventura, falto de consejo y menoscabado
de ánimo, a cada paso pienso que debajo de los pies de improviso se ha de
abrir otra sima más profunda que la otra, que acabe de tragarme. ¡Bien
vengas mal, si vienes solo!
Desta manera y con estos pensamientos le pareció que habría caminado poco
más de media legua, al cabo de la cual descubrió una confusa claridad, que
pareció ser ya de día, y que por alguna parte entraba, que daba indicio de
tener fin abierto aquel, para él, camino de la otra vida.
Aquí le deja Cide Hamete Benengeli, y vuelve a tratar de don Quijote,
que, alborozado y contento, esperaba el plazo de la batalla que había de
hacer con el robador de la honra de la hija de doña Rodríguez, a quien
pensaba enderezar el tuerto y desaguisado que malamente le tenían fecho.
Sucedió, pues, que, saliéndose una mañana a imponerse y ensayarse en lo que
había de hacer en el trance en que otro día pensaba verse, dando un repelón
o arremetida a Rocinante, llegó a poner los pies tan junto a una cueva,
que, a no tirarle fuertemente las riendas, fuera imposible no caer en ella.
En fin, le detuvo y no cayó, y, llegándose algo más cerca, sin apearse,
miró aquella hondura; y, estándola mirando, oyó grandes voces dentro; y,
escuchando atentamente, pudo percebir y entender que el que las daba decía:
— ¡Ah de arriba! ¿Hay algún cristiano que me escuche, o algún caballero
caritativo que se duela de un pecador enterrado en vida, o un desdichado
desgobernado gobernador?
Parecióle a don Quijote que oía la voz de Sancho Panza, de que quedó
suspenso y asombrado, y, levantando la voz todo lo que pudo, dijo:
— ¿Quién está allá bajo? ¿Quién se queja?
— ¿Quién puede estar aquí, o quién se ha de quejar —respondieron—, sino el
asendereado de Sancho Panza, gobernador, por sus pecados y por su mala
andanza, de la ínsula Barataria, escudero que fue del famoso caballero don
Quijote de la Mancha?
Oyendo lo cual don Quijote, se le dobló la admiración y se le acrecentó el
pasmo, viniéndosele al pensamiento que Sancho Panza debía de ser muerto, y
que estaba allí penando su alma, y llevado desta imaginación dijo:
— Conjúrote por todo aquello que puedo conjurarte como católico cristiano,
que me digas quién eres; y si eres alma en pena, dime qué quieres que haga
por ti; que, pues es mi profesión favorecer y acorrer a los necesitados
deste mundo, también lo seré para acorrer y ayudar a los menesterosos del
otro mundo, que no pueden ayudarse por sí propios.
— Desa manera —respondieron—, vuestra merced que me habla debe de ser mi
señor don Quijote de la Mancha, y aun en el órgano de la voz no es otro,
sin duda.
— Don Quijote soy —replicó don Quijote—, el que profeso socorrer y ayudar en
sus necesidades a los vivos y a los muertos. Por eso dime quién eres, que
me tienes atónito; porque si eres mi escudero Sancho Panza, y te has
muerto, como no te hayan llevado los diablos, y, por la misericordia de
Dios, estés en el purgatorio, sufragios tiene nuestra Santa Madre la
Iglesia Católica Romana bastantes a sacarte de las penas en que estás, y
yo, que lo solicitaré con ella, por mi parte, con cuanto mi hacienda
alcanzare; por eso, acaba de declararte y dime quién eres.
— ¡Voto a tal! —respondieron—, y por el nacimiento de quien vuesa merced
quisiere, juro, señor don Quijote de la Mancha, que yo soy su escudero
Sancho Panza, y que nunca me he muerto en todos los días de mi vida; sino
que, habiendo dejado mi gobierno por cosas y causas que es menester más
espacio para decirlas, anoche caí en esta sima donde yago, el rucio
conmigo, que no me dejará mentir, pues, por más señas, está aquí conmigo.
Y hay más: que no parece sino que el jumento entendió lo que Sancho dijo,
porque al momento comenzó a rebuznar, tan recio, que toda la cueva
retumbaba.
— ¡Famoso testigo! —dijo don Quijote—. El rebuzno conozco como si le
pariera, y tu voz oigo, Sancho mío. Espérame; iré al castillo del duque,
que está aquí cerca, y traeré quien te saque desta sima, donde tus pecados
te deben de haber puesto.
— Vaya vuesa merced —dijo Sancho—, y vuelva presto, por un solo Dios, que ya
no lo puedo llevar el estar aquí sepultado en vida, y me estoy muriendo de
miedo.
Dejóle don Quijote, y fue al castillo a contar a los duques el suceso de
Sancho Panza, de que no poco se maravillaron, aunque bien entendieron que
debía de haber caído por la correspondencia de aquella gruta que de tiempos
inmemoriales estaba allí hecha; pero no podían pensar cómo había dejado el
gobierno sin tener ellos aviso de su venida. Finalmente, como dicen,
llevaron sogas y maromas; y, a costa de mucha gente y de mucho trabajo,
sacaron al rucio y a Sancho Panza de aquellas tinieblas a la luz del sol.
Viole un estudiante, y dijo:
— Desta manera habían de salir de sus gobiernos todos los malos
gobernadores, como sale este pecador del profundo del abismo: muerto de
hambre, descolorido, y sin blanca, a lo que yo creo.
Oyólo Sancho, y dijo:
— Ocho días o diez ha, hermano murmurador, que entré a gobernar la ínsula
que me dieron, en los cuales no me vi harto de pan siquiera un hora; en
ellos me han perseguido médicos, y enemigos me han brumado los güesos; ni
he tenido lugar de hacer cohechos, ni de cobrar derechos; y, siendo esto
así, como lo es, no merecía yo, a mi parecer, salir de esta manera; pero el
hombre pone y Dios dispone, y Dios sabe lo mejor y lo que le está bien a
cada uno; y cual el tiempo, tal el tiento; y nadie diga "desta agua no
beberé", que adonde se piensa que hay tocinos, no hay estacas; y Dios me
entiende, y basta, y no digo más, aunque pudiera.
— No te enojes, Sancho, ni recibas pesadumbre de lo que oyeres, que será
nunca acabar: ven tú con segura conciencia, y digan lo que dijeren; y es
querer atar las lenguas de los maldicientes lo mesmo que querer poner
puertas al campo. Si el gobernador sale rico de su gobierno, dicen dél que
ha sido un ladrón, y si sale pobre, que ha sido un para poco y un
mentecato.
— A buen seguro —respondió Sancho— que por esta vez antes me han de tener
por tonto que por ladrón.
En estas pláticas llegaron, rodeados de muchachos y de otra mucha gente, al
castillo, adonde en unos corredores estaban ya el duque y la duquesa
esperando a don Quijote y a Sancho, el cual no quiso subir a ver al duque
sin que primero no hubiese acomodado al rucio en la caballeriza, porque
decía que había pasado muy mala noche en la posada; y luego subió a ver a
sus señores, ante los cuales, puesto de rodillas, dijo:
— Yo, señores, porque lo quiso así vuestra grandeza, sin ningún merecimiento
mío, fui a gobernar vuestra ínsula Barataria, en la cual entré desnudo, y
desnudo me hallo: ni pierdo, ni gano. Si he gobernado bien o mal, testigos
he tenido delante, que dirán lo que quisieren. He declarado dudas,
sentenciado pleitos, siempre muerto de hambre, por haberlo querido así el
doctor Pedro Recio, natural de Tirteafuera, médico insulano y
gobernadoresco. Acometiéronnos enemigos de noche, y, habiéndonos puesto en
grande aprieto, dicen los de la ínsula que salieron libres y con vitoria
por el valor de mi brazo, que tal salud les dé Dios como ellos dicen
verdad. En resolución, en este tiempo yo he tanteado las cargas que trae
consigo, y las obligaciones, el gobernar, y he hallado por mi cuenta que no
las podrán llevar mis hombros, ni son peso de mis costillas, ni flechas de
mi aljaba; y así, antes que diese conmigo al través el gobierno, he querido
yo dar con el gobierno al través, y ayer de mañana dejé la ínsula como la
hallé: con las mismas calles, casas y tejados que tenía cuando entré en
ella. No he pedido prestado a nadie, ni metídome en granjerías; y, aunque
pensaba hacer algunas ordenanzas provechosas, no hice ninguna, temeroso que
no se habían de guardar: que es lo mesmo hacerlas que no hacerlas. Salí,
como digo, de la ínsula sin otro acompañamiento que el de mi rucio; caí en
una sima, víneme por ella adelante, hasta que, esta mañana, con la luz del
sol, vi la salida, pero no tan fácil que, a no depararme el cielo a mi
señor don Quijote, allí me quedara hasta la fin del mundo. Así que, mis
señores duque y duquesa, aquí está vuestro gobernador Sancho Panza, que ha
granjeado en solos diez días que ha tenido el gobierno a conocer que no se
le ha de dar nada por ser gobernador, no que de una ínsula, sino de todo el
mundo; y, con este presupuesto, besando a vuestras mercedes los pies,
imitando al juego de los muchachos, que dicen "Salta tú, y dámela tú", doy
un salto del gobierno, y me paso al servicio de mi señor don Quijote; que,
en fin, en él, aunque como el pan con sobresalto, hártome, a lo menos, y
para mí, como yo esté harto, eso me hace que sea de zanahorias que de
perdices.
Con esto dio fin a su larga plática Sancho, temiendo siempre don Quijote
que había de decir en ella millares de disparates; y, cuando le vio acabar
con tan pocos, dio en su corazón gracias al cielo, y el duque abrazó a
Sancho, y le dijo que le pesaba en el alma de que hubiese dejado tan presto
el gobierno; pero que él haría de suerte que se le diese en su estado otro
oficio de menos carga y de más provecho. Abrazóle la duquesa asimismo, y
mandó que le regalasen, porque daba señales de venir mal molido y peor
parado.
Capítulo LVI. De la descomunal y nunca vista batalla que pasó entre don
Quijote de la Mancha y el lacayo Tosilos, en la defensa de la hija de la
dueña doña Rodríguez
No quedaron arrepentidos los duques de la burla hecha a Sancho Panza del
gobierno que le dieron; y más, que aquel mismo día vino su mayordomo, y les
contó punto por punto, todas casi, las palabras y acciones que Sancho había
dicho y hecho en aquellos días, y finalmente les encareció el asalto de la
ínsula, y el miedo de Sancho, y su salida, de que no pequeño gusto
recibieron.
Después desto, cuenta la historia que se llegó el día de la batalla
aplazada, y, habiendo el duque una y muy muchas veces advertido a su lacayo
Tosilos cómo se había de avenir con don Quijote para vencerle sin matarle
ni herirle, ordenó que se quitasen los hierros a las lanzas, diciendo a don
Quijote que no permitía la cristiandad, de que él se preciaba, que aquella
batalla fuese con tanto riesgo y peligro de las vidas, y que se contentase
con que le daba campo franco en su tierra, puesto que iba contra el decreto
del Santo Concilio, que prohíbe los tales desafíos, y no quisiese llevar
por todo rigor aquel trance tan fuerte.
Don Quijote dijo que Su Excelencia dispusiese las cosas de aquel negocio
como más fuese servido; que él le obedecería en todo. Llegado, pues, el
temeroso día, y habiendo mandado el duque que delante de la plaza del
castillo se hiciese un espacioso cadahalso, donde estuviesen los jueces del
campo y las dueñas, madre y hija, demandantes, había acudido de todos los
lugares y aldeas circunvecinas infinita gente, a ver la novedad de aquella
batalla; que nunca otra tal no habían visto, ni oído decir en aquella
tierra los que vivían ni los que habían muerto.
El primero que entró en el campo y estacada fue el maestro de las
ceremonias, que tanteó el campo, y le paseó todo, porque en él no hubiese
algún engaño, ni cosa encubierta donde se tropezase y cayese; luego
entraron las dueñas y se sentaron en sus asientos, cubiertas con los mantos
hasta los ojos y aun hasta los pechos, con muestras de no pequeño
sentimiento. Presente don Quijote en la estacada, de allí a poco,
acompañado de muchas trompetas, asomó por una parte de la plaza, sobre un
poderoso caballo, hundiéndola toda, el grande lacayo Tosilos, calada la
visera y todo encambronado, con unas fuertes y lucientes armas. El caballo
mostraba ser frisón, ancho y de color tordillo; de cada mano y pie le
pendía una arroba de lana.
Venía el valeroso combatiente bien informado del duque su señor de cómo se
había de portar con el valeroso don Quijote de la Mancha, advertido que en
ninguna manera le matase, sino que procurase huir el primer encuentro por
escusar el peligro de su muerte, que estaba cierto si de lleno en lleno le
encontrase. Paseó la plaza, y, llegando donde las dueñas estaban, se puso
algún tanto a mirar a la que por esposo le pedía. Llamó el maese de campo a
don Quijote, que ya se había presentado en la plaza, y junto con Tosilos
habló a las dueñas, preguntándoles si consentían que volviese por su
derecho don Quijote de la Mancha. Ellas dijeron que sí, y que todo lo que
en aquel caso hiciese lo daban por bien hecho, por firme y por valedero.
Ya en este tiempo estaban el duque y la duquesa puestos en una galería que
caía sobre la estacada, toda la cual estaba coronada de infinita gente, que
esperaba ver el riguroso trance nunca visto. Fue condición de los
combatientes que si don Quijote vencía, su contrario se había de casar con
la hija de doña Rodríguez; y si él fuese vencido, quedaba libre su
contendor de la palabra que se le pedía, sin dar otra satisfación alguna.
Partióles el maestro de las ceremonias el sol, y puso a los dos cada uno en
el puesto donde habían de estar. Sonaron los atambores, llenó el aire el
son de las trompetas, temblaba debajo de los pies la tierra; estaban
suspensos los corazones de la mirante turba, temiendo unos y esperando
otros el bueno o el mal suceso de aquel caso. Finalmente, don Quijote,
encomendándose de todo su corazón a Dios Nuestro Señor y a la señora
Dulcinea del Toboso, estaba aguardando que se le diese señal precisa de la
arremetida; empero, nuestro lacayo tenía diferentes pensamientos: no
pensaba él sino en lo que agora diré:
Parece ser que, cuando estuvo mirando a su enemiga, le pareció la más
hermosa mujer que había visto en toda su vida, y el niño ceguezuelo, a
quien suelen llamar de ordinario Amor por esas calles, no quiso perder la
ocasión que se le ofreció de triunfar de una alma lacayuna y ponerla en la
lista de sus trofeos; y así, llegándose a él bonitamente, sin que nadie le
viese, le envasó al pobre lacayo una flecha de dos varas por el lado
izquierdo, y le pasó el corazón de parte a parte; y púdolo hacer bien al
seguro, porque el Amor es invisible, y entra y sale por do quiere, sin que
nadie le pida cuenta de sus hechos.
Digo, pues, que, cuando dieron la señal de la arremetida, estaba nuestro
lacayo transportado, pensando en la hermosura de la que ya había hecho
señora de su libertad, y así, no atendió al son de la trompeta, como hizo
don Quijote, que, apenas la hubo oído, cuando arremetió, y, a todo el
correr que permitía Rocinante, partió contra su enemigo; y, viéndole partir
su buen escudero Sancho, dijo a grandes voces:
— ¡Dios te guíe, nata y flor de los andantes caballeros! ¡Dios te dé la
vitoria, pues llevas la razón de tu parte!
Y, aunque Tosilos vio venir contra sí a don Quijote, no se movió un paso de
su puesto; antes, con grandes voces, llamó al maese de campo, el cual
venido a ver lo que quería, le dijo:
— Señor, ¿esta batalla no se hace porque yo me case, o no me case, con
aquella señora?
— Así es —le fue respondido.
— Pues yo —dijo el lacayo— soy temeroso de mi conciencia, y pondríala en
gran cargo si pasase adelante en esta batalla; y así, digo que yo me doy
por vencido y que quiero casarme luego con aquella señora.
Quedó admirado el maese de campo de las razones de Tosilos; y, como era uno
de los sabidores de la máquina de aquel caso, no le supo responder palabra.
Detúvose don Quijote en la mitad de su carrera, viendo que su enemigo no
le acometía. El duque no sabía la ocasión porque no se pasaba adelante en
la batalla, pero el maese de campo le fue a declarar lo que Tosilos decía,
de lo que quedó suspenso y colérico en estremo.
En tanto que esto pasaba, Tosilos se llegó adonde doña Rodríguez estaba, y
dijo a grandes voces:
— Yo, señora, quiero casarme con vuestra hija, y no quiero alcanzar por
pleitos ni contiendas lo que puedo alcanzar por paz y sin peligro de la
muerte.
Oyó esto el valeroso don Quijote, y dijo:
— Pues esto así es, yo quedo libre y suelto de mi promesa: cásense en hora
buena, y, pues Dios Nuestro Señor se la dio, San Pedro se la bendiga.
El duque había bajado a la plaza del castillo, y, llegándose a Tosilos, le
dijo:
— ¿Es verdad, caballero, que os dais por vencido, y que, instigado de
vuestra temerosa conciencia, os queréis casar con esta doncella?
— Sí, señor —respondió Tosilos.
— Él hace muy bien —dijo a esta sazón Sancho Panza—, porque lo que has de
dar al mur, dalo al gato, y sacarte ha de cuidado.
Íbase Tosilos desenlazando la celada, y rogaba que apriesa le ayudasen,
porque le iban faltando los espíritus del aliento, y no podía verse
encerrado tanto tiempo en la estrecheza de aquel aposento. Quitáronsela
apriesa, y quedó descubierto y patente su rostro de lacayo. Viendo lo cual
doña Rodríguez y su hija, dando grandes voces, dijeron:
— ¡Éste es engaño, engaño es éste! ¡A Tosilos, el lacayo del duque mi señor,
nos han puesto en lugar de mi verdadero esposo! ¡Justicia de Dios y del
Rey, de tanta malicia, por no decir bellaquería!
— No vos acuitéis, señoras —dijo don Quijote—, que ni ésta es malicia ni es
bellaquería; y si la es, y no ha sido la causa el duque, sino los malos
encantadores que me persiguen, los cuales, invidiosos de que yo alcanzase
la gloria deste vencimiento, han convertido el rostro de vuestro esposo en
el de este que decís que es lacayo del duque. Tomad mi consejo, y, a pesar
de la malicia de mis enemigos, casaos con él, que sin duda es el mismo que
vos deseáis alcanzar por esposo.
El duque, que esto oyó, estuvo por romper en risa toda su cólera, y dijo:
— Son tan extraordinarias las cosas que suceden al señor don Quijote que
estoy por creer que este mi lacayo no lo es; pero usemos deste ardid y
maña: dilatemos el casamiento quince días, si quieren, y tengamos encerrado
a este personaje que nos tiene dudosos, en los cuales podría ser que
volviese a su prístina figura; que no ha de durar tanto el rancor que los
encantadores tienen al señor don Quijote, y más, yéndoles tan poco en usar
estos embelecos y transformaciones.
— ¡Oh señor! —dijo Sancho—, que ya tienen estos malandrines por uso y
costumbre de mudar las cosas, de unas en otras, que tocan a mi amo. Un
caballero que venció los días pasados, llamado el de los Espejos, le
volvieron en la figura del bachiller Sansón Carrasco, natural de nuestro
pueblo y grande amigo nuestro, y a mi señora Dulcinea del Toboso la han
vuelto en una rústica labradora; y así, imagino que este lacayo ha de morir
y vivir lacayo todos los días de su vida.
A lo que dijo la hija de Rodríguez:
— Séase quien fuere este que me pide por esposa, que yo se lo agradezco; que
más quiero ser mujer legítima de un lacayo que no amiga y burlada de un
caballero, puesto que el que a mí me burló no lo es.
En resolución, todos estos cuentos y sucesos pararon en que Tosilos se
recogiese, hasta ver en qué paraba su transformación; aclamaron todos la
vitoria por don Quijote, y los más quedaron tristes y melancólicos de ver
que no se habían hecho pedazos los tan esperados combatientes, bien así
como los mochachos quedan tristes cuando no sale el ahorcado que esperan,
porque le ha perdonado, o la parte, o la justicia. Fuese la gente,
volviéronse el duque y don Quijote al castillo, encerraron a Tosilos,
quedaron doña Rodríguez y su hija contentísimas de ver que, por una vía o
por otra, aquel caso había de parar en casamiento, y Tosilos no esperaba
menos.
Capítulo LVII. Que trata de cómo don Quijote se despidió del duque, y de lo
que le sucedió con la discreta y desenvuelta Altisidora, doncella de la
duquesa
Ya le pareció a don Quijote que era bien salir de tanta ociosidad como la
que en aquel castillo tenía; que se imaginaba ser grande la falta que su
persona hacía en dejarse estar encerrado y perezoso entre los infinitos
regalos y deleites que como a caballero andante aquellos señores le hacían,
y parecíale que había de dar cuenta estrecha al cielo de aquella ociosidad
y encerramiento; y así, pidió un día licencia a los duques para partirse.
Diéronsela, con muestras de que en gran manera les pesaba de que los
dejase. Dio la duquesa las cartas de su mujer a Sancho Panza, el cual lloró
con ellas, y dijo:
— ¿Quién pensara que esperanzas tan grandes como las que en el pecho de mi
mujer Teresa Panza engendraron las nuevas de mi gobierno habían de parar en
volverme yo agora a las arrastradas aventuras de mi amo don Quijote de la
Mancha? Con todo esto, me contento de ver que mi Teresa correspondió a ser
quien es, enviando las bellotas a la duquesa; que, a no habérselas enviado,
quedando yo pesaroso, me mostrara ella desagradecida. Lo que me consuela es
que esta dádiva no se le puede dar nombre de cohecho, porque ya tenía yo el
gobierno cuando ella las envió, y está puesto en razón que los que reciben
algún beneficio, aunque sea con niñerías, se muestren agradecidos. En
efecto, yo entré desnudo en el gobierno y salgo desnudo dél; y así, podré
decir con segura conciencia, que no es poco: "Desnudo nací, desnudo me
hallo: ni pierdo ni gano".
Esto pasaba entre sí Sancho el día de la partida; y, saliendo don Quijote,
habiéndose despedido la noche antes de los duques, una mañana se presentó
armado en la plaza del castillo. Mirábanle de los corredores toda la gente
del castillo, y asimismo los duques salieron a verle. Estaba Sancho sobre
su rucio, con sus alforjas, maleta y repuesto, contentísimo, porque el
mayordomo del duque, el que fue la Trifaldi, le había dado un bolsico con
docientos escudos de oro, para suplir los menesteres del camino, y esto aún
no lo sabía don Quijote.
Estando, como queda dicho, mirándole todos, a deshora, entre las otras
dueñas y doncellas de la duquesa, que le miraban, alzó la voz la
desenvuelta y discreta Altisidora, y en son lastimero dijo:
-Escucha, mal caballero;
detén un poco las riendas;
no fatigues las ijadas
de tu mal regida bestia.
Mira, falso, que no huyas
de alguna serpiente fiera,
sino de una corderilla
que está muy lejos de oveja.
Tú has burlado, monstruo horrendo,
la más hermosa doncella
que Dïana vio en sus montes,
que Venus miró en sus selvas.
Cruel Vireno, fugitivo Eneas,
Barrabás te acompañe; allá te avengas.
Tú llevas, ¡llevar impío!,
en las garras de tus cerras
las entrañas de una humilde,
como enamorada, tierna.
Llévaste tres tocadores,
y unas ligas, de unas piernas
que al mármol puro se igualan
en lisas, blancas y negras.
Llévaste dos mil suspiros,
que, a ser de fuego, pudieran
abrasar a dos mil Troyas,
si dos mil Troyas hubiera.
Cruel Vireno, fugitivo Eneas,
Barrabás te acompañe; allá te avengas.
De ese Sancho, tu escudero,
las entrañas sean tan tercas
y tan duras, que no salga
de su encanto Dulcinea.
De la culpa que tú tienes
lleve la triste la pena;
que justos por pecadores
tal vez pagan en mi tierra.
Tus más finas aventuras
en desventuras se vuelvan,
en sueños tus pasatiempos,
en olvidos tus firmezas.
Cruel Vireno, fugitivo Eneas,
Barrabás te acompañe; allá te avengas.
Seas tenido por falso
desde Sevilla a Marchena,
desde Granada hasta Loja,
de Londres a Inglaterra.
Si jugares al reinado,
los cientos, o la primera,
los reyes huyan de ti;
ases ni sietes no veas.
Si te cortares los callos,
sangre las heridas viertan,
y quédente los raigones
si te sacares las muelas.
Cruel Vireno, fugitivo Eneas,
Barrabás te acompañe; allá te avengas.
En tanto que, de la suerte que se ha dicho, se quejaba la lastimada
Altisidora, la estuvo mirando don Quijote, y, sin responderla palabra,
volviendo el rostro a Sancho, le dijo:
— Por el siglo de tus pasados, Sancho mío, te conjuro que me digas una
verdad. Dime, ¿llevas por ventura los tres tocadores y las ligas que esta
enamorada doncella dice?
A lo que Sancho respondió:
— Los tres tocadores sí llevo; pero las ligas, como por los cerros de Úbeda.
Quedó la duquesa admirada de la desenvoltura de Altisidora, que, aunque la
tenía por atrevida, graciosa y desenvuelta, no en grado que se atreviera a
semejantes desenvolturas; y, como no estaba advertida desta burla, creció
más su admiración. El duque quiso reforzar el donaire, y dijo:
— No me parece bien, señor caballero, que, habiendo recebido en este mi
castillo el buen acogimiento que en él se os ha hecho, os hayáis atrevido a
llevaros tres tocadores, por lo menos, si por lo más las ligas de mi
doncella; indicios son de mal pecho y muestras que no corresponden a
vuestra fama. Volvedle las ligas; si no, yo os desafío a mortal batalla,
sin tener temor que malandrines encantadores me vuelvan ni muden el rostro,
como han hecho en el de Tosilos mi lacayo, el que entró con vos en batalla.
— No quiera Dios —respondió don Quijote— que yo desenvaine mi espada contra
vuestra ilustrísima persona, de quien tantas mercedes he recebido; los
tocadores volveré, porque dice Sancho que los tiene; las ligas es
imposible, porque ni yo las he recebido ni él tampoco; y si esta vuestra
doncella quisiere mirar sus escondrijos, a buen seguro que las halle. Yo,
señor duque, jamás he sido ladrón, ni lo pienso ser en toda mi vida, como
Dios no me deje de su mano. Esta doncella habla, como ella dice, como
enamorada, de lo que yo no le tengo culpa; y así, no tengo de qué pedirle
perdón ni a ella ni a Vuestra Excelencia, a quien suplico me tenga en mejor
opinión, y me dé de nuevo licencia para seguir mi camino.
— Déosle Dios tan bueno —dijo la duquesa—, señor don Quijote, que siempre
oigamos buenas nuevas de vuestras fechurías. Y andad con Dios; que,
mientras más os detenéis, más aumentáis el fuego en los pechos de las
doncellas que os miran; y a la mía yo la castigaré de modo, que de aquí
adelante no se desmande con la vista ni con las palabras.
— Una no más quiero que me escuches, ¡oh valeroso don Quijote! —dijo
entonces Altisidora—; y es que te pido perdón del latrocinio de las ligas,
porque, en Dios y en mi ánima que las tengo puestas, y he caído en el
descuido del que yendo sobre el asno, le buscaba.
— ¿No lo dije yo? —dijo Sancho—. ¡Bonico soy yo para encubrir hurtos! Pues,
a quererlos hacer, de paleta me había venido la ocasión en mi gobierno.
Abajó la cabeza don Quijote y hizo reverencia a los duques y a todos los
circunstantes, y, volviendo las riendas a Rocinante, siguiéndole Sancho
sobre el rucio, se salió del castillo, enderezando su camino a Zaragoza.
Capítulo LVIII. Que trata de cómo menudearon sobre don Quijote aventuras
tantas, que no se daban vagar unas a otras
Cuando don Quijote se vio en la campaña rasa, libre y desembarazado de los
requiebros de Altisidora, le pareció que estaba en su centro, y que los
espíritus se le renovaban para proseguir de nuevo el asumpto de sus
caballerías, y, volviéndose a Sancho, le dijo:
— La libertad, Sancho, es uno de los más preciosos dones que a los hombres
dieron los cielos; con ella no pueden igualarse los tesoros que encierra la
tierra ni el mar encubre; por la libertad, así como por la honra, se puede
y debe aventurar la vida, y, por el contrario, el cautiverio es el mayor
mal que puede venir a los hombres. Digo esto, Sancho, porque bien has visto
el regalo, la abundancia que en este castillo que dejamos hemos tenido;
pues en metad de aquellos banquetes sazonados y de aquellas bebidas de
nieve, me parecía a mí que estaba metido entre las estrechezas de la
hambre, porque no lo gozaba con la libertad que lo gozara si fueran míos;
que las obligaciones de las recompensas de los beneficios y mercedes
recebidas son ataduras que no dejan campear al ánimo libre. ¡Venturoso
aquél a quien el cielo dio un pedazo de pan, sin que le quede obligación de
agradecerlo a otro que al mismo cielo!
— Con todo eso —dijo Sancho— que vuesa merced me ha dicho, no es bien que se
quede sin agradecimiento de nuestra parte docientos escudos de oro que en
una bolsilla me dio el mayordomo del duque, que como píctima y confortativo
la llevo puesta sobre el corazón, para lo que se ofreciere; que no siempre
hemos de hallar castillos donde nos regalen, que tal vez toparemos con
algunas ventas donde nos apaleen.
En estos y otros razonamientos iban los andantes, caballero y escudero,
cuando vieron, habiendo andado poco más de una legua, que encima de la
yerba de un pradillo verde, encima de sus capas, estaban comiendo hasta una
docena de hombres, vestidos de labradores. Junto a sí tenían unas como
sábanas blancas, con que cubrían alguna cosa que debajo estaba; estaban
empinadas y tendidas, y de trecho a trecho puestas. Llegó don Quijote a los
que comían, y, saludándolos primero cortésmente, les preguntó que qué era
lo que aquellos lienzos cubrían. Uno dellos le respondió:
— Señor, debajo destos lienzos están unas imágines de relieve y entabladura
que han de servir en un retablo que hacemos en nuestra aldea; llevámoslas
cubiertas, porque no se desfloren, y en hombros, porque no se quiebren.
— Si sois servidos —respondió don Quijote—, holgaría de verlas, pues
imágines que con tanto recato se llevan, sin duda deben de ser buenas.
— Y ¡cómo si lo son! —dijo otro—. Si no, dígalo lo que cuesta: que en verdad
que no hay ninguna que no esté en más de cincuenta ducados; y, porque vea
vuestra merced esta verdad, espere vuestra merced, y verla ha por vista de
ojos.
Y, levantándose, dejó de comer y fue a quitar la cubierta de la primera
imagen, que mostró ser la de San Jorge puesto a caballo, con una serpiente
enroscada a los pies y la lanza atravesada por la boca, con la fiereza que
suele pintarse. Toda la imagen parecía una ascua de oro, como suele
decirse. Viéndola don Quijote, dijo:
— Este caballero fue uno de los mejores andantes que tuvo la milicia divina:
llamóse don San Jorge, y fue además defendedor de doncellas. Veamos esta
otra.
Descubrióla el hombre, y pareció ser la de San Martín puesto a caballo, que
partía la capa con el pobre; y, apenas la hubo visto don Quijote, cuando
dijo:
— Este caballero también fue de los aventureros cristianos, y creo que fue
más liberal que valiente, como lo puedes echar de ver, Sancho, en que está
partiendo la capa con el pobre y le da la mitad; y sin duda debía de ser
entonces invierno, que, si no, él se la diera toda, según era de
caritativo.
— No debió de ser eso —dijo Sancho—, sino que se debió de atener al refrán
que dicen: que para dar y tener, seso es menester.
Rióse don Quijote y pidió que quitasen otro lienzo, debajo del cual se
descubrió la imagen del Patrón de las Españas a caballo, la espada
ensangrentada, atropellando moros y pisando cabezas; y, en viéndola, dijo
don Quijote:
— Éste sí que es caballero, y de las escuadras de Cristo; éste se llama don
San Diego Matamoros, uno de los más valientes santos y caballeros que tuvo
el mundo y tiene agora el cielo.
Luego descubrieron otro lienzo, y pareció que encubría la caída de San
Pablo del caballo abajo, con todas las circunstancias que en el retablo de
su conversión suelen pintarse. Cuando le vido tan al vivo, que dijeran que
Cristo le hablaba y Pablo respondía.
— Éste —dijo don Quijote— fue el mayor enemigo que tuvo la Iglesia de Dios
Nuestro Señor en su tiempo, y el mayor defensor suyo que tendrá jamás:
caballero andante por la vida, y santo a pie quedo por la muerte,
trabajador incansable en la viña del Señor, doctor de las gentes, a quien
sirvieron de escuelas los cielos y de catedrático y maestro que le enseñase
el mismo Jesucristo.
No había más imágines, y así, mandó don Quijote que las volviesen a cubrir,
y dijo a los que las llevaban:
— Por buen agüero he tenido, hermanos, haber visto lo que he visto, porque
estos santos y caballeros profesaron lo que yo profeso, que es el ejercicio
de las armas; sino que la diferencia que hay entre mí y ellos es que ellos
fueron santos y pelearon a lo divino, y yo soy pecador y peleo a lo humano.
Ellos conquistaron el cielo a fuerza de brazos, porque el cielo padece
fuerza, y yo hasta agora no sé lo que conquisto a fuerza de mis trabajos;
pero si mi Dulcinea del Toboso saliese de los que padece, mejorándose mi
ventura y adobándoseme el juicio, podría ser que encaminase mis pasos por
mejor camino del que llevo.
— Dios lo oiga y el pecado sea sordo —dijo Sancho a esta ocasión.
Admiráronse los hombres, así de la figura como de las razones de don
Quijote, sin entender la mitad de lo que en ellas decir quería. Acabaron de
comer, cargaron con sus imágines, y, despidiéndose de don Quijote,
siguieron su viaje.
Quedó Sancho de nuevo como si jamás hubiera conocido a su señor, admirado
de lo que sabía, pareciéndole que no debía de haber historia en el mundo ni
suceso que no lo tuviese cifrado en la uña y clavado en la memoria, y
díjole:
— En verdad, señor nuestramo, que si esto que nos ha sucedido hoy se puede
llamar aventura, ella ha sido de las más suaves y dulces que en todo el
discurso de nuestra peregrinación nos ha sucedido: della habemos salido sin
palos y sobresalto alguno, ni hemos echado mano a las espadas, ni hemos
batido la tierra con los cuerpos, ni quedamos hambrientos. Bendito sea
Dios, que tal me ha dejado ver con mis propios ojos.
— Tú dices bien, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, pero has de advertir que no
todos los tiempos son unos, ni corren de una misma suerte, y esto que el
vulgo suele llamar comúnmente agüeros, que no se fundan sobre natural razón
alguna, del que es discreto han de ser tenidos y juzgar por buenos
acontecimientos. Levántase uno destos agoreros por la mañana, sale de su
casa, encuéntrase con un fraile de la orden del bienaventurado San
Francisco, y, como si hubiera encontrado con un grifo, vuelve las espaldas
y vuélvese a su casa. Derrámasele al otro Mendoza la sal encima de la mesa,
y derrámasele a él la melancolía por el corazón, como si estuviese obligada
la naturaleza a dar señales de las venideras desgracias con cosas tan de
poco momento como las referidas. El discreto y cristiano no ha de andar en
puntillos con lo que quiere hacer el cielo. Llega Cipión a África, tropieza
en saltando en tierra, tiénenlo por mal agüero sus soldados; pero él,
abrazándose con el suelo, dijo: ''No te me podrás huir, África, porque te
tengo asida y entre mis brazos''. Así que, Sancho, el haber encontrado con
estas imágines ha sido para mí felicísimo acontecimiento.
— Yo así lo creo —respondió Sancho—, y querría que vuestra merced me dijese
qué es la causa por que dicen los españoles cuando quieren dar alguna
batalla, invocando aquel San Diego Matamoros: "¡Santiago, y cierra,
España!" ¿Está por ventura España abierta, y de modo que es menester
cerrarla, o qué ceremonia es ésta?
— Simplicísimo eres, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—; y mira que este gran
caballero de la cruz bermeja háselo dado Dios a España por patrón y amparo
suyo, especialmente en los rigurosos trances que con los moros los
españoles han tenido; y así, le invocan y llaman como a defensor suyo en
todas las batallas que acometen, y muchas veces le han visto visiblemente
en ellas, derribando, atropellando, destruyendo y matando los agarenos
escuadrones; y desta verdad te pudiera traer muchos ejemplos que en las
verdaderas historias españolas se cuentan.
Mudó Sancho plática, y dijo a su amo:
— Maravillado estoy, señor, de la desenvoltura de Altisidora, la doncella de
la duquesa: bravamente la debe de tener herida y traspasada aquel que
llaman Amor, que dicen que es un rapaz ceguezuelo que, con estar lagañoso,
o, por mejor decir, sin vista, si toma por blanco un corazón, por pequeño
que sea, le acierta y traspasa de parte a parte con sus flechas. He oído
decir también que en la vergüenza y recato de las doncellas se despuntan y
embotan las amorosas saetas, pero en esta Altisidora más parece que se
aguzan que despuntan.
— Advierte, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, que el amor ni mira respetos ni
guarda términos de razón en sus discursos, y tiene la misma condición que
la muerte: que así acomete los altos alcázares de los reyes como las
humildes chozas de los pastores, y cuando toma entera posesión de una alma,
lo primero que hace es quitarle el temor y la vergüenza; y así, sin ella
declaró Altisidora sus deseos, que engendraron en mi pecho antes confusión
que lástima.
— ¡Crueldad notoria! —dijo Sancho—. ¡Desagradecimiento inaudito! Yo de mí sé
decir que me rindiera y avasallara la más mínima razón amorosa suya.
¡Hideputa, y qué corazón de mármol, qué entrañas de bronce y qué alma de
argamasa! Pero no puedo pensar qué es lo que vio esta doncella en vuestra
merced que así la rindiese y avasallase: qué gala, qué brío, qué donaire,
qué rostro, que cada cosa por sí déstas, o todas juntas, le enamoraron; que
en verdad en verdad que muchas veces me paro a mirar a vuestra merced desde
la punta del pie hasta el último cabello de la cabeza, y que veo más cosas
para espantar que para enamorar; y, habiendo yo también oído decir que la
hermosura es la primera y principal parte que enamora, no teniendo vuestra
merced ninguna, no sé yo de qué se enamoró la pobre.
— Advierte, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que hay dos maneras de
hermosura: una del alma y otra del cuerpo; la del alma campea y se muestra
en el entendimiento, en la honestidad, en el buen proceder, en la
liberalidad y en la buena crianza, y todas estas partes caben y pueden
estar en un hombre feo; y cuando se pone la mira en esta hermosura, y no en
la del cuerpo, suele nacer el amor con ímpetu y con ventajas. Yo, Sancho,
bien veo que no soy hermoso, pero también conozco que no soy disforme; y
bástale a un hombre de bien no ser monstruo para ser bien querido, como
tenga los dotes del alma que te he dicho.
En estas razones y pláticas se iban entrando por una selva que fuera del
camino estaba, y a deshora, sin pensar en ello, se halló don Quijote
enredado entre unas redes de hilo verde, que desde unos árboles a otros
estaban tendidas; y, sin poder imaginar qué pudiese ser aquello, dijo a
Sancho:
— Paréceme, Sancho, que esto destas redes debe de ser una de las más nuevas
aventuras que pueda imaginar. Que me maten si los encantadores que me
persiguen no quieren enredarme en ellas y detener mi camino, como en
venganza de la riguridad que con Altisidora he tenido. Pues mándoles yo
que, aunque estas redes, si como son hechas de hilo verde fueran de
durísimos diamantes, o más fuertes que aquélla con que el celoso dios de
los herreros enredó a Venus y a Marte, así la rompiera como si fuera de
juncos marinos o de hilachas de algodón.
Y, queriendo pasar adelante y romperlo todo, al improviso se le ofrecieron
delante, saliendo de entre unos árboles, dos hermosísimas pastoras; a lo
menos, vestidas como pastoras, sino que los pellicos y sayas eran de fino
brocado, digo, que las sayas eran riquísimos faldellines de tabí de oro.
Traían los cabellos sueltos por las espaldas, que en rubios podían competir
con los rayos del mismo sol; los cuales se coronaban con dos guirnaldas de
verde laurel y de rojo amaranto tejidas. La edad, al parecer, ni bajaba de
los quince ni pasaba de los diez y ocho.
Vista fue ésta que admiró a Sancho, suspendió a don Quijote, hizo parar al
sol en su carrera para verlas, y tuvo en maravilloso silencio a todos
cuatro. En fin, quien primero habló fue una de las dos zagalas, que dijo a
don Quijote:
— Detened, señor caballero, el paso, y no rompáis las redes, que no para
daño vuestro, sino para nuestro pasatiempo, ahí están tendidas; y, porque
sé que nos habéis de preguntar para qué se han puesto y quién somos, os lo
quiero decir en breves palabras. En una aldea que está hasta dos leguas de
aquí, donde hay mucha gente principal y muchos hidalgos y ricos, entre
muchos amigos y parientes se concertó que con sus hijos, mujeres y hijas,
vecinos, amigos y parientes, nos viniésemos a holgar a este sitio, que es
uno de los más agradables de todos estos contornos, formando entre todos
una nueva y pastoril Arcadia, vistiéndonos las doncellas de zagalas y los
mancebos de pastores. Traemos estudiadas dos églogas, una del famoso poeta
Garcilaso, y otra del excelentísimo Camoes, en su misma lengua
portuguesa, las cuales hasta agora no hemos representado. Ayer fue el
primero día que aquí llegamos; tenemos entre estos ramos plantadas algunas
tiendas, que dicen se llaman de campaña, en el margen de un abundoso arroyo
que todos estos prados fertiliza; tendimos la noche pasada estas redes de
estos árboles para engañar los simples pajarillos, que, ojeados con nuestro
ruido, vinieren a dar en ellas. Si gustáis, señor, de ser nuestro huésped,
seréis agasajado liberal y cortésmente; porque por agora en este sitio no
ha de entrar la pesadumbre ni la melancolía.
Calló y no dijo más. A lo que respondió don Quijote:
— Por cierto, hermosísima señora, que no debió de quedar más suspenso ni
admirado Anteón cuando vio al improviso bañarse en las aguas a Diana, como
yo he quedado atónito en ver vuestra belleza. Alabo el asumpto de vuestros
entretenimientos, y el de vuestros ofrecimientos agradezco; y, si os puedo
servir, con seguridad de ser obedecidas me lo podéis mandar; porque no es
ésta la profesión mía, sino de mostrarme agradecido y bienhechor con todo
género de gente, en especial con la principal que vuestras personas
representa; y, si como estas redes, que deben de ocupar algún pequeño
espacio, ocuparan toda la redondez de la tierra, buscara yo nuevos mundos
por do pasar sin romperlas; y porque deis algún crédito a esta mi
exageración, ved que os lo promete, por lo menos, don Quijote de la Mancha,
si es que ha llegado a vuestros oídos este nombre.
— ¡Ay, amiga de mi alma —dijo entonces la otra zagala—, y qué ventura tan
grande nos ha sucedido! ¿Ves este señor que tenemos delante? Pues hágote
saber que es el más valiente, y el más enamorado, y el más comedido que
tiene el mundo, si no es que nos miente y nos engaña una historia que de
sus hazañas anda impresa y yo he leído. Yo apostaré que este buen hombre
que viene consigo es un tal Sancho Panza, su escudero, a cuyas gracias no
hay ningunas que se le igualen.
— Así es la verdad —dijo Sancho—: que yo soy ese gracioso y ese escudero que
vuestra merced dice, y este señor es mi amo, el mismo don Quijote de la
Mancha historiado y referido.
— ¡Ay! —dijo la otra—. Supliquémosle, amiga, que se quede; que nuestros
padres y nuestros hermanos gustarán infinito dello, que también he oído yo
decir de su valor y de sus gracias lo mismo que tú me has dicho, y, sobre
todo, dicen dél que es el más firme y más leal enamorado que se sabe, y que
su dama es una tal Dulcinea del Toboso, a quien en toda España la dan la
palma de la hermosura.
— Con razón se la dan —dijo don Quijote—, si ya no lo pone en duda vuestra
sin igual belleza. No os canséis, señoras, en detenerme, porque las
precisas obligaciones de mi profesión no me dejan reposar en ningún cabo.
Llegó, en esto, adonde los cuatro estaban un hermano de una de las dos
pastoras, vestido asimismo de pastor, con la riqueza y galas que a las de
las zagalas correspondía; contáronle ellas que el que con ellas estaba era
el valeroso don Quijote de la Mancha, y el otro, su escudero Sancho, de
quien tenía él ya noticia, por haber leído su historia. Ofreciósele el
gallardo pastor, pidióle que se viniese con él a sus tiendas; húbolo de
conceder don Quijote, y así lo hizo.
Llegó, en esto, el ojeo, llenáronse las redes de pajarillos diferentes que,
engañados de la color de las redes, caían en el peligro de que iban
huyendo. Juntáronse en aquel sitio más de treinta personas, todas
bizarramente de pastores y pastoras vestidas, y en un instante quedaron
enteradas de quiénes eran don Quijote y su escudero, de que no poco
contento recibieron, porque ya tenían dél noticia por su historia.
Acudieron a las tiendas, hallaron las mesas puestas, ricas, abundantes y
limpias; honraron a don Quijote dándole el primer lugar en ellas; mirábanle
todos, y admirábanse de verle.
Finalmente, alzados los manteles, con gran reposo alzó don Quijote la voz,
y dijo:
— Entre los pecados mayores que los hombres cometen, aunque algunos dicen
que es la soberbia, yo digo que es el desagradecimiento, ateniéndome a lo
que suele decirse: que de los desagradecidos está lleno el infierno. Este
pecado, en cuanto me ha sido posible, he procurado yo huir desde el
instante que tuve uso de razón; y si no puedo pagar las buenas obras que me
hacen con otras obras, pongo en su lugar los deseos de hacerlas, y cuando
éstos no bastan, las publico; porque quien dice y publica las buenas obras
que recibe, también las recompensara con otras, si pudiera; porque, por la
mayor parte, los que reciben son inferiores a los que dan; y así, es Dios
sobre todos, porque es dador sobre todos y no pueden corresponder las
dádivas del hombre a las de Dios con igualdad, por infinita distancia; y
esta estrecheza y cortedad, en cierto modo, la suple el agradecimiento. Yo,
pues, agradecido a la merced que aquí se me ha hecho, no pudiendo
corresponder a la misma medida, conteniéndome en los estrechos límites de
mi poderío, ofrezco lo que puedo y lo que tengo de mi cosecha; y así, digo
que sustentaré dos días naturales en metad de ese camino real que va a
Zaragoza, que estas señoras zagalas contrahechas que aquí están son las más
hermosas doncellas y más corteses que hay en el mundo, excetado sólo a la
sin par Dulcinea del Toboso, única señora de mis pensamientos, con paz sea
dicho de cuantos y cuantas me escuchan.
Oyendo lo cual, Sancho, que con grande atención le había estado escuchando,
dando una gran voz, dijo:
— ¿Es posible que haya en el mundo personas que se atrevan a decir y a jurar
que este mi señor es loco? Digan vuestras mercedes, señores pastores: ¿hay
cura de aldea, por discreto y por estudiante que sea, que pueda decir lo
que mi amo ha dicho, ni hay caballero andante, por más fama que tenga de
valiente, que pueda ofrecer lo que mi amo aquí ha ofrecido?
Volvióse don Quijote a Sancho, y, encendido el rostro y colérico, le dijo:
— ¿Es posible, ¡oh Sancho!, que haya en todo el orbe alguna persona que diga
que no eres tonto, aforrado de lo mismo, con no sé qué ribetes de malicioso
y de bellaco? ¿Quién te mete a ti en mis cosas, y en averiguar si soy
discreto o majadero? Calla y no me repliques, sino ensilla, si está
desensillado Rocinante: vamos a poner en efecto mi ofrecimiento, que, con
la razón que va de mi parte, puedes dar por vencidos a todos cuantos
quisieren contradecirla.
Y, con gran furia y muestras de enojo, se levantó de la silla, dejando
admirados a los circunstantes, haciéndoles dudar si le podían tener por
loco o por cuerdo. Finalmente, habiéndole persuadido que no se pusiese en
tal demanda, que ellos daban por bien conocida su agradecida voluntad y que
no eran menester nuevas demostraciones para conocer su ánimo valeroso, pues
bastaban las que en la historia de sus hechos se referían, con todo esto,
salió don Quijote con su intención; y, puesto sobre Rocinante, embrazando
su escudo y tomando su lanza, se puso en la mitad de un real camino que no
lejos del verde prado estaba. Siguióle Sancho sobre su rucio, con toda la
gente del pastoral rebaño, deseosos de ver en qué paraba su arrogante y
nunca visto ofrecimiento.
Puesto, pues, don Quijote en mitad del camino —como os he dicho—, hirió el
aire con semejantes palabras:
— ¡Oh vosotros, pasajeros y viandantes, caballeros, escuderos, gente de a
pie y de a caballo que por este camino pasáis, o habéis de pasar en estos
dos días siguientes! Sabed que don Quijote de la Mancha, caballero andante,
está aquí puesto para defender que a todas las hermosuras y cortesías del
mundo exceden las que se encierran en las ninfas habitadoras destos prados
y bosques, dejando a un lado a la señora de mi alma Dulcinea del Toboso.
Por eso, el que fuere de parecer contrario, acuda, que aquí le espero.
Dos veces repitió estas mismas razones, y dos veces no fueron oídas de
ningún aventurero; pero la suerte, que sus cosas iba encaminando de mejor
en mejor, ordenó que de allí a poco se descubriese por el camino
muchedumbre de hombres de a caballo, y muchos dellos con lanzas en las
manos, caminando todos apiñados, de tropel y a gran priesa. No los hubieron
bien visto los que con don Quijote estaban, cuando, volviendo las espaldas,
se apartaron bien lejos del camino, porque conocieron que si esperaban les
podía suceder algún peligro; sólo don Quijote, con intrépido corazón, se
estuvo quedo, y Sancho Panza se escudó con las ancas de Rocinante.
Llegó el tropel de los lanceros, y uno dellos, que venía más delante, a
grandes voces comenzó a decir a don Quijote:
— ¡Apártate, hombre del diablo, del camino, que te harán pedazos estos
toros!
— ¡Ea, canalla —respondió don Quijote—, para mí no hay toros que valgan,
aunque sean de los más bravos que cría Jarama en sus riberas! Confesad,
malandrines, así a carga cerrada, que es verdad lo que yo aquí he
publicado; si no, conmigo sois en batalla.
No tuvo lugar de responder el vaquero, ni don Quijote le tuvo de desviarse,
aunque quisiera; y así, el tropel de los toros bravos y el de los mansos
cabestros, con la multitud de los vaqueros y otras gentes que a encerrar
los llevaban a un lugar donde otro día habían de correrse, pasaron sobre
don Quijote, y sobre Sancho, Rocinante y el rucio, dando con todos ellos en
tierra, echándole a rodar por el suelo. Quedó molido Sancho, espantado don
Quijote, aporreado el rucio y no muy católico Rocinante; pero, en fin, se
levantaron todos, y don Quijote, a gran priesa, tropezando aquí y cayendo
allí, comenzó a correr tras la vacada, diciendo a voces:
— ¡Deteneos y esperad, canalla malandrina, que un solo caballero os espera,
el cual no tiene condición ni es de parecer de los que dicen que al enemigo
que huye, hacerle la puente de plata!
Pero no por eso se detuvieron los apresurados corredores, ni hicieron más
caso de sus amenazas que de las nubes de antaño. Detúvole el cansancio a
don Quijote, y, más enojado que vengado, se sentó en el camino, esperando a
que Sancho, Rocinante y el rucio llegasen. Llegaron, volvieron a subir amo
y mozo, y, sin volver a despedirse de la Arcadia fingida o contrahecha, y
con más vergüenza que gusto, siguieron su camino.
Capítulo LIX. Donde se cuenta del extraordinario suceso, que se puede
tener por aventura, que le sucedió a don Quijote
Al polvo y al cansancio que don Quijote y Sancho sacaron del
descomedimiento de los toros, socorrió una fuente clara y limpia que entre
una fresca arboleda hallaron, en el margen de la cual, dejando libres, sin
jáquima y freno, al rucio y a Rocinante, los dos asendereados amo y mozo se
sentaron. Acudió Sancho a la repostería de su alforjas, y dellas sacó de lo
que él solía llamar condumio; enjuagóse la boca, lavóse don Quijote el
rostro, con cuyo refrigerio cobraron aliento los espíritus desalentados. No
comía don Quijote, de puro pesaroso, ni Sancho no osaba tocar a los
manjares que delante tenía, de puro comedido, y esperaba a que su señor
hiciese la salva; pero, viendo que, llevado de sus imaginaciones, no se
acordaba de llevar el pan a la boca, no abrió la suya, y, atropellando por
todo género de crianza, comenzó a embaular en el estómago el pan y queso
que se le ofrecía.
— Come, Sancho amigo —dijo don Quijote—, sustenta la vida, que más que a mí
te importa, y déjame morir a mí a manos de mis pensamientos y a fuerzas de
mis desgracias. Yo, Sancho, nací para vivir muriendo, y tú para morir
comiendo; y, porque veas que te digo verdad en esto, considérame impreso en
historias, famoso en las armas, comedido en mis acciones, respetado de
príncipes, solicitado de doncellas; al cabo al cabo, cuando esperaba
palmas, triunfos y coronas, granjeadas y merecidas por mis valerosas
hazañas, me he visto esta mañana pisado y acoceado y molido de los pies de
animales inmundos y soeces. Esta consideración me embota los dientes,
entorpece las muelas, y entomece las manos, y quita de todo en todo la
gana del comer, de manera que pienso dejarme morir de hambre: muerte la más
cruel de las muertes.
— Desa manera —dijo Sancho, sin dejar de mascar apriesa— no aprobará vuestra
merced aquel refrán que dicen: "muera Marta, y muera harta". Yo, a lo
menos, no pienso matarme a mí mismo; antes pienso hacer como el zapatero,
que tira el cuero con los dientes hasta que le hace llegar donde él quiere;
yo tiraré mi vida comiendo hasta que llegue al fin que le tiene determinado
el cielo; y sepa, señor, que no hay mayor locura que la que toca en querer
desesperarse como vuestra merced, y créame, y después de comido, échese a
dormir un poco sobre los colchones verdes destas yerbas, y verá como cuando
despierte se halla algo más aliviado.
Hízolo así don Quijote, pareciéndole que las razones de Sancho más eran de
filósofo que de mentecato, y díjole:
— Si tú, ¡oh Sancho!, quisieses hacer por mí lo que yo ahora te diré, serían
mis alivios más ciertos y mis pesadumbres no tan grandes; y es que,
mientras yo duermo, obedeciendo tus consejos, tú te desviases un poco lejos
de aquí, y con las riendas de Rocinante, echando al aire tus carnes, te
dieses trecientos o cuatrocientos azotes a buena cuenta de los tres mil y
tantos que te has de dar por el desencanto de Dulcinea; que es lástima no
pequeña que aquella pobre señora esté encantada por tu descuido y
negligencia.
— Hay mucho que decir en eso —dijo Sancho—. Durmamos, por ahora, entrambos,
y después, Dios dijo lo que será. Sepa vuestra merced que esto de azotarse
un hombre a sangre fría es cosa recia, y más si caen los azotes sobre un
cuerpo mal sustentado y peor comido: tenga paciencia mi señora Dulcinea,
que, cuando menos se cate, me verá hecho una criba, de azotes; y hasta la
muerte, todo es vida; quiero decir que aún yo la tengo, junto con el deseo
de cumplir con lo que he prometido.
Agradeciéndoselo don Quijote, comió algo, y Sancho mucho, y echáronse a
dormir entrambos, dejando a su albedrío y sin orden alguna pacer del
abundosa yerba de que aquel prado estaba lleno a los dos continuos
compañeros y amigos Rocinante y el rucio. Despertaron algo tarde, volvieron
a subir y a seguir su camino, dándose priesa para llegar a una venta que,
al parecer, una legua de allí se descubría. Digo que era venta porque don
Quijote la llamó así, fuera del uso que tenía de llamar a todas las ventas
castillos.
Llegaron, pues, a ella; preguntaron al huésped si había posada. Fueles
respondido que sí, con toda la comodidad y regalo que pudiera hallar en
Zaragoza. Apeáronse y recogió Sancho su repostería en un aposento, de quien
el huésped le dio la llave; llevó las bestias a la caballeriza, echóles sus
piensos, salió a ver lo que don Quijote, que estaba sentado sobre un poyo,
le mandaba, dando particulares gracias al cielo de que a su amo no le
hubiese parecido castillo aquella venta.
Llegóse la hora del cenar; recogiéronse a su estancia; preguntó Sancho al
huésped que qué tenía para darles de cenar. A lo que el huésped respondió
que su boca sería medida; y así, que pidiese lo que quisiese: que de las
pajaricas del aire, de las aves de la tierra y de los pescados del mar
estaba proveída aquella venta.
— No es menester tanto —respondió Sancho—, que con un par de pollos que nos
asen tendremos lo suficiente, porque mi señor es delicado y come poco, y yo
no soy tragantón en demasía.
Respondióle el huésped que no tenía pollos, porque los milanos los tenían
asolados.
— Pues mande el señor huésped —dijo Sancho— asar una polla que sea tierna.
— ¿Polla? ¡Mi padre! —respondió el huésped—. En verdad en verdad que envié
ayer a la ciudad a vender más de cincuenta; pero, fuera de pollas, pida
vuestra merced lo que quisiere.
— Desa manera —dijo Sancho—, no faltará ternera o cabrito.
— En casa, por ahora —respondió el huésped—, no lo hay, porque se ha
acabado; pero la semana que viene lo habrá de sobra.
— ¡Medrados estamos con eso! —respondió Sancho—. Yo pondré que se vienen a
resumirse todas estas faltas en las sobras que debe de haber de tocino y
huevos.
— ¡Por Dios —respondió el huésped—, que es gentil relente el que mi huésped
tiene!, pues hele dicho que ni tengo pollas ni gallinas, y ¿quiere que
tenga huevos? Discurra, si quisiere, por otras delicadezas, y déjese de
pedir gallinas.
— Resolvámonos, cuerpo de mí —dijo Sancho—, y dígame finalmente lo que
tiene, y déjese de discurrimientos, señor huésped.
Dijo el ventero:
— Lo que real y verdaderamente tengo son dos uñas de vaca que parecen manos
de ternera, o dos manos de ternera que parecen uñas de vaca; están cocidas
con sus garbanzos, cebollas y tocino, y la hora de ahora están diciendo:
''¡Coméme! ¡Coméme!''
— Por mías las marco desde aquí —dijo Sancho—; y nadie las toque, que yo las
pagaré mejor que otro, porque para mí ninguna otra cosa pudiera esperar de
más gusto, y no se me daría nada que fuesen manos, como fuesen uñas.
— Nadie las tocará —dijo el ventero—, porque otros huéspedes que tengo, de
puro principales, traen consigo cocinero, despensero y repostería.
— Si por principales va —dijo Sancho—, ninguno más que mi amo; pero el
oficio que él trae no permite despensas ni botillerías: ahí nos tendemos en
mitad de un prado y nos hartamos de bellotas o de nísperos.
Esta fue la plática que Sancho tuvo con el ventero, sin querer Sancho pasar
adelante en responderle; que ya le había preguntado qué oficio o qué
ejercicio era el de su amo.
Llegóse, pues, la hora del cenar, recogióse a su estancia don Quijote,
trujo el huésped la olla, así como estaba, y sentóse a cenar muy de
propósito. Parece ser que en otro aposento que junto al de don Quijote
estaba, que no le dividía más que un sutil tabique, oyó decir don Quijote:
— Por vida de vuestra merced, señor don Jerónimo, que en tanto que trae la
cena leamos otro capítulo de la segunda parte de Don Quijote de la Mancha.
Apenas oyó su nombre don Quijote, cuando se puso en pie, y con oído alerto
escuchó lo que dél trataban, y oyó que el tal don Jerónimo referido
respondió:
— ¿Para qué quiere vuestra merced, señor don Juan, que leamos estos
disparates? Y el que hubiere leído la primera parte de la historia de don
Quijote de la Mancha no es posible que pueda tener gusto en leer esta
segunda.
— Con todo eso —dijo el don Juan—, será bien leerla, pues no hay libro tan
malo que no tenga alguna cosa buena. Lo que a mí en éste más desplace es
que pinta a don Quijote ya desenamorado de Dulcinea del Toboso.
Oyendo lo cual don Quijote, lleno de ira y de despecho, alzó la voz y dijo:
— Quienquiera que dijere que don Quijote de la Mancha ha olvidado, ni puede
olvidar, a Dulcinea del Toboso, yo le haré entender con armas iguales que
va muy lejos de la verdad; porque la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso ni puede
ser olvidada, ni en don Quijote puede caber olvido: su blasón es la
firmeza, y su profesión, el guardarla con suavidad y sin hacerse fuerza
alguna.
— ¿Quién es el que nos responde? —respondieron del otro aposento.
— ¿Quién ha de ser —respondió Sancho— sino el mismo don Quijote de la
Mancha, que hará bueno cuanto ha dicho, y aun cuanto dijere?; que al buen
pagador no le duelen prendas.
Apenas hubo dicho esto Sancho, cuando entraron por la puerta de su aposento
dos caballeros, que tales lo parecían, y uno dellos echando los brazos al
cuello de don Quijote, le dijo:
— Ni vuestra presencia puede desmentir vuestro nombre, ni vuestro nombre
puede no acreditar vuestra presencia: sin duda, vos, señor, sois el
verdadero don Quijote de la Mancha, norte y lucero de la andante
caballería, a despecho y pesar del que ha querido usurpar vuestro nombre y
aniquilar vuestras hazañas, como lo ha hecho el autor deste libro que aquí
os entrego.
Y, poniéndole un libro en las manos, que traía su compañero, le tomó don
Quijote, y, sin responder palabra, comenzó a hojearle, y de allí a un poco
se le volvió, diciendo:
— En esto poco que he visto he hallado tres cosas en este autor dignas de
reprehensión. La primera es algunas palabras que he leído en el prólogo; la
otra, que el lenguaje es aragonés, porque tal vez escribe sin artículos, y
la tercera, que más le confirma por ignorante, es que yerra y se desvía de
la verdad en lo más principal de la historia; porque aquí dice que la mujer
de Sancho Panza mi escudero se llama Mari Gutiérrez, y no llama tal, sino
Teresa Panza; y quien en esta parte tan principal yerra, bien se podrá
temer que yerra en todas las demás de la historia.
A esto dijo Sancho:
— ¡Donosa cosa de historiador! ¡Por cierto, bien debe de estar en el cuento
de nuestros sucesos, pues llama a Teresa Panza, mi mujer, Mari Gutiérrez!
Torne a tomar el libro, señor, y mire si ando yo por ahí y si me ha mudado
el nombre.
— Por lo que he oído hablar, amigo —dijo don Jerónimo—, sin duda debéis de
ser Sancho Panza, el escudero del señor don Quijote.
— Sí soy —respondió Sancho—, y me precio dello.
— Pues a fe —dijo el caballero— que no os trata este autor moderno con la
limpieza que en vuestra persona se muestra: píntaos comedor, y simple, y no
nada gracioso, y muy otro del Sancho que en la primera parte de la historia
de vuestro amo se describe.
— Dios se lo perdone —dijo Sancho—. Dejárame en mi rincón, sin acordarse de
mí, porque quien las sabe las tañe, y bien se está San Pedro en Roma.
Los dos caballeros pidieron a don Quijote se pasase a su estancia a cenar
con ellos, que bien sabían que en aquella venta no había cosas
pertenecientes para su persona. Don Quijote, que siempre fue comedido,
condecenció con su demanda y cenó con ellos; quedóse Sancho con la olla con
mero mixto imperio; sentóse en cabecera de mesa, y con él el ventero, que
no menos que Sancho estaba de sus manos y de sus uñas aficionado.
En el discurso de la cena preguntó don Juan a don Quijote qué nuevas tenía
de la señora Dulcinea del Toboso: si se había casado, si estaba parida o
preñada, o si, estando en su entereza, se acordaba —guardando su honestidad
y buen decoro— de los amorosos pensamientos del señor don Quijote. A lo que
él respondió:
— Dulcinea se está entera, y mis pensamientos, más firmes que nunca; las
correspondencias, en su sequedad antigua; su hermosura, en la de una soez
labradora transformada.
Y luego les fue contando punto por punto el encanto de la señora Dulcinea,
y lo que le había sucedido en la cueva de Montesinos, con la orden que el
sabio Merlín le había dado para desencantarla, que fue la de los azotes de
Sancho.
Sumo fue el contento que los dos caballeros recibieron de oír contar a don
Quijote los estraños sucesos de su historia, y así quedaron admirados de
sus disparates como del elegante modo con que los contaba. Aquí le tenían
por discreto, y allí se les deslizaba por mentecato, sin saber determinarse
qué grado le darían entre la discreción y la locura.
Acabó de cenar Sancho, y, dejando hecho equis al ventero, se pasó a la
estancia de su amo; y, en entrando, dijo:
— Que me maten, señores, si el autor deste libro que vuesas mercedes tienen
quiere que no comamos buenas migas juntos; yo querría que, ya que me llama
comilón, como vuesas mercedes dicen, no me llamase también borracho.
— Sí llama —dijo don Jerónimo—, pero no me acuerdo en qué manera, aunque sé
que son malsonantes las razones, y además, mentirosas, según yo echo de ver
en la fisonomía del buen Sancho que está presente.
— Créanme vuesas mercedes —dijo Sancho— que el Sancho y el don Quijote desa
historia deben de ser otros que los que andan en aquella que compuso Cide
Hamete Benengeli, que somos nosotros: mi amo, valiente, discreto y
enamorado; y yo, simple gracioso, y no comedor ni borracho.
— Yo así lo creo —dijo don Juan—; y si fuera posible, se había de mandar que
ninguno fuera osado a tratar de las cosas del gran don Quijote, si no fuese
Cide Hamete, su primer autor, bien así como mandó Alejandro que ninguno
fuese osado a retratarle sino Apeles.
— Retráteme el que quisiere —dijo don Quijote—, pero no me maltrate; que
muchas veces suele caerse la paciencia cuando la cargan de injurias.
— Ninguna —dijo don Juan— se le puede hacer al señor don Quijote de quien él
no se pueda vengar, si no la repara en el escudo de su paciencia, que, a mi
parecer, es fuerte y grande.
En estas y otras pláticas se pasó gran parte de la noche; y, aunque don
Juan quisiera que don Quijote leyera más del libro, por ver lo que
discantaba, no lo pudieron acabar con él, diciendo que él lo daba por leído
y lo confirmaba por todo necio, y que no quería, si acaso llegase a noticia
de su autor que le había tenido en sus manos, se alegrase con pensar que le
había leído; pues de las cosas obscenas y torpes, los pensamientos se han
de apartar, cuanto más los ojos. Preguntáronle que adónde llevaba
determinado su viaje. Respondió que a Zaragoza, a hallarse en las justas
del arnés, que en aquella ciudad suelen hacerse todos los años. Díjole
don Juan que aquella nueva historia contaba como don Quijote, sea quien
se quisiere, se había hallado en ella en una sortija, falta de invención,
pobre de letras, pobrísima de libreas, aunque rica de simplicidades.
— Por el mismo caso —respondió don Quijote—, no pondré los pies en Zaragoza,
y así sacaré a la plaza del mundo la mentira dese historiador moderno, y
echarán de ver las gentes como yo no soy el don Quijote que él dice.
— Hará muy bien —dijo don Jerónimo—; y otras justas hay en Barcelona, donde
podrá el señor don Quijote mostrar su valor.
— Así lo pienso hacer —dijo don Quijote—; y vuesas mercedes me den licencia,
pues ya es hora para irme al lecho, y me tengan y pongan en el número de
sus mayores amigos y servidores.
— Y a mí también —dijo Sancho—: quizá seré bueno para algo.
Con esto se despidieron, y don Quijote y Sancho se retiraron a su aposento,
dejando a don Juan y a don Jerónimo admirados de ver la mezcla que había
hecho de su discreción y de su locura; y verdaderamente creyeron que éstos
eran los verdaderos don Quijote y Sancho, y no los que describía su autor
aragonés.
Madrugó don Quijote, y, dando golpes al tabique del otro aposento, se
despidió de sus huéspedes. Pagó Sancho al ventero magníficamente, y
aconsejóle que alabase menos la provisión de su venta, o la tuviese más
proveída.
Capítulo LX. De lo que sucedió a don Quijote yendo a Barcelona
Era fresca la mañana, y daba muestras de serlo asimesmo el día en que don
Quijote salió de la venta, informándose primero cuál era el más derecho
camino para ir a Barcelona sin tocar en Zaragoza: tal era el deseo que
tenía de sacar mentiroso aquel nuevo historiador que tanto decían que le
vituperaba.
Sucedió, pues, que en más de seis días no le sucedió cosa digna de ponerse
en escritura, al cabo de los cuales, yendo fuera de camino, le tomó la
noche entre unas espesas encinas o alcornoques; que en esto no guarda la
puntualidad Cide Hamete que en otras cosas suele.
Apeáronse de sus bestias amo y mozo, y, acomodándose a los troncos de los
árboles, Sancho, que había merendado aquel día, se dejó entrar de rondón
por las puertas del sueño; pero don Quijote, a quien desvelaban sus
imaginaciones mucho más que la hambre, no podía pegar sus ojos; antes iba y
venía con el pensamiento por mil géneros de lugares. Ya le parecía hallarse
en la cueva de Montesinos; ya ver brincar y subir sobre su pollina a la
convertida en labradora Dulcinea; ya que le sonaban en los oídos las
palabras del sabio Merlín que le referían las condiciones y diligencias que
se habían de hacer y tener en el desencanto de Dulcinea. Desesperábase de
ver la flojedad y caridad poca de Sancho su escudero, pues, a lo que creía,
solos cinco azotes se había dado, número desigual y pequeño para los
infinitos que le faltaban; y desto recibió tanta pesadumbre y enojo, que
hizo este discurso:
— Si nudo gordiano cortó el Magno Alejandro, diciendo: ''Tanto monta cortar
como desatar'', y no por eso dejó de ser universal señor de toda la Asia,
ni más ni menos podría suceder ahora en el desencanto de Dulcinea, si yo
azotase a Sancho a pesar suyo; que si la condición deste remedio está en
que Sancho reciba los tres mil y tantos azotes, ¿qué se me da a mí que se
los dé él, o que se los dé otro, pues la sustancia está en que él los
reciba, lleguen por do llegaren?
Con esta imaginación se llegó a Sancho, habiendo primero tomado las riendas
de Rocinante, y acomodádolas en modo que pudiese azotarle con ellas,
comenzóle a quitar las cintas, que es opinión que no tenía más que la
delantera, en que se sustentaban los greguescos; pero, apenas hubo llegado,
cuando Sancho despertó en todo su acuerdo, y dijo:
— ¿Qué es esto? ¿Quién me toca y desencinta?
— Yo soy —respondió don Quijote—, que vengo a suplir tus faltas y a remediar
mis trabajos: véngote a azotar, Sancho, y a descargar, en parte, la deuda a
que te obligaste. Dulcinea perece; tú vives en descuido; yo muero deseando;
y así, desatácate por tu voluntad, que la mía es de darte en esta soledad,
por lo menos, dos mil azotes.
— Eso no —dijo Sancho—; vuesa merced se esté quedo; si no, por Dios
verdadero que nos han de oír los sordos. Los azotes a que yo me obligué han
de ser voluntarios, y no por fuerza, y ahora no tengo gana de azotarme;
basta que doy a vuesa merced mi palabra de vapularme y mosquearme cuando en
voluntad me viniere.
— No hay dejarlo a tu cortesía, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, porque eres duro
de corazón, y, aunque villano, blando de carnes.
Y así, procuraba y pugnaba por desenlazarle. Viendo lo cual Sancho Panza,
se puso en pie, y, arremetiendo a su amo, se abrazó con él a brazo partido,
y, echándole una zancadilla, dio con él en el suelo boca arriba; púsole
la rodilla derecha sobre el pecho, y con las manos le tenía las manos, de
modo que ni le dejaba rodear ni alentar. Don Quijote le decía:
— ¿Cómo, traidor? ¿Contra tu amo y señor natural te desmandas? ¿Con quien te
da su pan te atreves?
— Ni quito rey, ni pongo rey —respondió Sancho—, sino ayúdome a mí, que soy
mi señor. Vuesa merced me prometa que se estará quedo, y no tratará de
azotarme por agora, que yo le dejaré libre y desembarazado; donde no,
Aquí morirás, traidor,
enemigo de doña Sancha.
Prometióselo don Quijote, y juró por vida de sus pensamientos no tocarle en
el pelo de la ropa, y que dejaría en toda su voluntad y albedrío el
azotarse cuando quisiese.
Levantóse Sancho, y desvióse de aquel lugar un buen espacio; y, yendo a
arrimarse a otro árbol, sintió que le tocaban en la cabeza, y, alzando las
manos, topó con dos pies de persona, con zapatos y calzas. Tembló de miedo;
acudió a otro árbol, y sucedióle lo mesmo. Dio voces llamando a don Quijote
que le favoreciese. Hízolo así don Quijote, y, preguntándole qué le había
sucedido y de qué tenía miedo, le respondió Sancho que todos aquellos
árboles estaban llenos de pies y de piernas humanas. Tentólos don Quijote,
y cayó luego en la cuenta de lo que podía ser, y díjole a Sancho:
— No tienes de qué tener miedo, porque estos pies y piernas que tientas y no
vees, sin duda son de algunos forajidos y bandoleros que en estos árboles
están ahorcados; que por aquí los suele ahorcar la justicia cuando los
coge, de veinte en veinte y de treinta en treinta; por donde me doy a
entender que debo de estar cerca de Barcelona.
Y así era la verdad como él lo había imaginado.
Al parecer alzaron los ojos, y vieron los racimos de aquellos árboles, que
eran cuerpos de bandoleros. Ya, en esto, amanecía, y si los muertos los
habían espantado, no menos los atribularon más de cuarenta bandoleros vivos
que de improviso les rodearon, diciéndoles en lengua catalana que
estuviesen quedos, y se detuviesen, hasta que llegase su capitán.
Hallóse don Quijote a pie, su caballo sin freno, su lanza arrimada a un
árbol, y, finalmente, sin defensa alguna; y así, tuvo por bien de cruzar
las manos e inclinar la cabeza, guardándose para mejor sazón y coyuntura.
Acudieron los bandoleros a espulgar al rucio, y a no dejarle ninguna cosa
de cuantas en las alforjas y la maleta traía; y avínole bien a Sancho que
en una ventrera que tenía ceñida venían los escudos del duque y los que
habían sacado de su tierra, y, con todo eso, aquella buena gente le
escardara y le mirara hasta lo que entre el cuero y la carne tuviera
escondido, si no llegara en aquella sazón su capitán, el cual mostró ser de
hasta edad de treinta y cuatro años, robusto, más que de mediana
proporción, de mirar grave y color morena. Venía sobre un poderoso caballo,
vestida la acerada cota, y con cuatro pistoletes —que en aquella tierra se
llaman pedreñales— a los lados. Vio que sus escuderos, que así llaman a los
que andan en aquel ejercicio, iban a despojar a Sancho Panza; mandóles que
no lo hiciesen, y fue luego obedecido; y así se escapó la ventrera.
Admiróle ver lanza arrimada al árbol, escudo en el suelo, y a don Quijote
armado y pensativo, con la más triste y melancólica figura que pudiera
formar la misma tristeza. Llegóse a él diciéndole:
— No estéis tan triste, buen hombre, porque no habéis caído en las manos de
algún cruel Osiris, sino en las de Roque Guinart, que tienen más de
compasivas que de rigurosas.
— No es mi tristeza —respondió don Quijote— haber caído en tu poder, ¡oh
valeroso Roque, cuya fama no hay límites en la tierra que la encierren!,
sino por haber sido tal mi descuido, que me hayan cogido tus soldados sin
el freno, estando yo obligado, según la orden de la andante caballería, que
profeso, a vivir contino alerta, siendo a todas horas centinela de mí
mismo; porque te hago saber, ¡oh gran Roque!, que si me hallaran sobre mi
caballo, con mi lanza y con mi escudo, no les fuera muy fácil rendirme,
porque yo soy don Quijote de la Mancha, aquel que de sus hazañas tiene
lleno todo el orbe.
Luego Roque Guinart conoció que la enfermedad de don Quijote tocaba más en
locura que en valentía, y, aunque algunas veces le había oído nombrar,
nunca tuvo por verdad sus hechos, ni se pudo persuadir a que semejante
humor reinase en corazón de hombre; y holgóse en estremo de haberle
encontrado, para tocar de cerca lo que de lejos dél había oído; y así, le
dijo:
— Valeroso caballero, no os despechéis ni tengáis a siniestra fortuna ésta
en que os halláis, que podía ser que en estos tropiezos vuestra torcida
suerte se enderezase; que el cielo, por estraños y nunca vistos rodeos, de
los hombres no imaginados, suele levantar los caídos y enriquecer los
pobres.
Ya le iba a dar las gracias don Quijote, cuando sintieron a sus espaldas un
ruido como de tropel de caballos, y no era sino un solo, sobre el cual
venía a toda furia un mancebo, al parecer de hasta veinte años, vestido de
damasco verde, con pasamanos de oro, greguescos y saltaembarca, con
sombrero terciado, a la valona, botas enceradas y justas, espuelas, daga y
espada doradas, una escopeta pequeña en las manos y dos pistolas a los
lados. Al ruido volvió Roque la cabeza y vio esta hermosa figura, la cual,
en llegando a él, dijo:
— En tu busca venía, ¡oh valeroso Roque!, para hallar en ti, si no remedio,
a lo menos alivio en mi desdicha; y, por no tenerte suspenso, porque sé que
no me has conocido, quiero decirte quién soy: y soy Claudia Jerónima, hija
de Simón Forte, tu singular amigo y enemigo particular de Clauquel
Torrellas, que asimismo lo es tuyo, por ser uno de los de tu contrario
bando; y ya sabes que este Torrellas tiene un hijo que don Vicente
Torrellas se llama, o, a lo menos, se llamaba no ha dos horas. Éste, pues,
por abreviar el cuento de mi desventura, te diré en breves palabras la que
me ha causado. Viome, requebróme, escuchéle, enamoréme, a hurto de mi
padre; porque no hay mujer, por retirada que esté y recatada que sea, a
quien no le sobre tiempo para poner en ejecución y efecto sus atropellados
deseos. Finalmente, él me prometió de ser mi esposo, y yo le di la palabra
de ser suya, sin que en obras pasásemos adelante. Supe ayer que, olvidado
de lo que me debía, se casaba con otra, y que esta mañana iba a desposarse,
nueva que me turbó el sentido y acabó la paciencia; y, por no estar mi
padre en el lugar, le tuve yo de ponerme en el traje que vees, y
apresurando el paso a este caballo, alcancé a don Vicente obra de una legua
de aquí; y, sin ponerme a dar quejas ni a oír disculpas, le disparé estas
escopetas, y, por añadidura, estas dos pistolas; y, a lo que creo, le debí
de encerrar más de dos balas en el cuerpo, abriéndole puertas por donde
envuelta en su sangre saliese mi honra. Allí le dejo entre sus criados, que
no osaron ni pudieron ponerse en su defensa. Vengo a buscarte para que me
pases a Francia, donde tengo parientes con quien viva, y asimesmo a rogarte
defiendas a mi padre, porque los muchos de don Vicente no se atrevan a
tomar en él desaforada venganza.
Roque, admirado de la gallardía, bizarría, buen talle y suceso de la
hermosa Claudia, le dijo:
— Ven, señora, y vamos a ver si es muerto tu enemigo, que después veremos lo
que más te importare.
Don Quijote, que estaba escuchando atentamente lo que Claudia había dicho y
lo que Roque Guinart respondió, dijo:
— No tiene nadie para qué tomar trabajo en defender a esta señora, que lo
tomo yo a mi cargo: denme mi caballo y mis armas, y espérenme aquí, que yo
iré a buscar a ese caballero, y, muerto o vivo, le haré cumplir la palabra
prometida a tanta belleza.
— Nadie dude de esto —dijo Sancho—, porque mi señor tiene muy buena mano
para casamentero, pues no ha muchos días que hizo casar a otro que también
negaba a otra doncella su palabra; y si no fuera porque los encantadores
que le persiguen le mudaron su verdadera figura en la de un lacayo, ésta
fuera la hora que ya la tal doncella no lo fuera.
Roque, que atendía más a pensar en el suceso de la hermosa Claudia que en
las razones de amo y mozo, no las entendió; y, mandando a sus escuderos que
volviesen a Sancho todo cuanto le habían quitado del rucio, mandándoles
asimesmo que se retirasen a la parte donde aquella noche habían estado
alojados, y luego se partió con Claudia a toda priesa a buscar al herido, o
muerto, don Vicente. Llegaron al lugar donde le encontró Claudia, y no
hallaron en él sino recién derramada sangre; pero, tendiendo la vista por
todas partes, descubrieron por un recuesto arriba alguna gente, y diéronse
a entender, como era la verdad, que debía ser don Vicente, a quien sus
criados, o muerto o vivo, llevaban, o para curarle, o para enterrarle;
diéronse priesa a alcanzarlos, que, como iban de espacio, con facilidad lo
hicieron.
Hallaron a don Vicente en los brazos de sus criados, a quien con cansada y
debilitada voz rogaba que le dejasen allí morir, porque el dolor de las
heridas no consentía que más adelante pasase.
Arrojáronse de los caballos Claudia y Roque, llegáronse a él, temieron los
criados la presencia de Roque, y Claudia se turbó en ver la de don Vicente;
y así, entre enternecida y rigurosa, se llegó a él, y asiéndole de las
manos, le dijo:
— Si tú me dieras éstas, conforme a nuestro concierto, nunca tú te vieras en
este paso.
Abrió los casi cerrados ojos el herido caballero, y, conociendo a Claudia,
le dijo:
— Bien veo, hermosa y engañada señora, que tú has sido la que me has muerto:
pena no merecida ni debida a mis deseos, con los cuales, ni con mis obras,
jamás quise ni supe ofenderte.
— Luego, ¿no es verdad —dijo Claudia— que ibas esta mañana a desposarte con
Leonora, la hija del rico Balvastro?
— No, por cierto —respondió don Vicente—; mi mala fortuna te debió de llevar
estas nuevas, para que, celosa, me quitases la vida, la cual, pues la dejo
en tus manos y en tus brazos, tengo mi suerte por venturosa. Y, para
asegurarte desta verdad, aprieta la mano y recíbeme por esposo, si
quisieres, que no tengo otra mayor satisfación que darte del agravio que
piensas que de mí has recebido.
Apretóle la mano Claudia, y apretósele a ella el corazón, de manera que
sobre la sangre y pecho de don Vicente se quedó desmayada, y a él le tomó
un mortal parasismo. Confuso estaba Roque, y no sabía qué hacerse.
Acudieron los criados a buscar agua que echarles en los rostros, y
trujéronla, con que se los bañaron. Volvió de su desmayo Claudia, pero no
de su parasismo don Vicente, porque se le acabó la vida. Visto lo cual de
Claudia, habiéndose enterado que ya su dulce esposo no vivía, rompió los
aires con suspiros, hirió los cielos con quejas, maltrató sus cabellos,
entregándolos al viento, afeó su rostro con sus propias manos, con todas
las muestras de dolor y sentimiento que de un lastimado pecho pudieran
imaginarse.
— ¡Oh cruel e inconsiderada mujer —decía—, con qué facilidad te moviste a
poner en ejecución tan mal pensamiento! ¡Oh fuerza rabiosa de los celos, a
qué desesperado fin conducís a quien os da acogida en su pecho! ¡Oh esposo
mío, cuya desdichada suerte, por ser prenda mía, te ha llevado del tálamo a
la sepultura!
Tales y tan tristes eran las quejas de Claudia, que sacaron las lágrimas de
los ojos de Roque, no acostumbrados a verterlas en ninguna ocasión.
Lloraban los criados, desmayábase a cada paso Claudia, y todo aquel
circuito parecía campo de tristeza y lugar de desgracia. Finalmente, Roque
Guinart ordenó a los criados de don Vicente que llevasen su cuerpo al lugar
de su padre, que estaba allí cerca, para que le diesen sepultura. Claudia
dijo a Roque que querría irse a un monasterio donde era abadesa una tía
suya, en el cual pensaba acabar la vida, de otro mejor esposo y más eterno
acompañada. Alabóle Roque su buen propósito, ofreciósele de acompañarla
hasta donde quisiese, y de defender a su padre de los parientes y de todo
el mundo, si ofenderle quisiese. No quiso su compañía Claudia, en ninguna
manera, y, agradeciendo sus ofrecimientos con las mejores razones que supo,
se despedió dél llorando. Los criados de don Vicente llevaron su cuerpo, y
Roque se volvió a los suyos, y este fin tuvieron los amores de Claudia
Jerónima. Pero, ¿qué mucho, si tejieron la trama de su lamentable historia
las fuerzas invencibles y rigurosas de los celos?
Halló Roque Guinart a sus escuderos en la parte donde les había ordenado, y
a don Quijote entre ellos, sobre Rocinante, haciéndoles una plática en que
les persuadía dejasen aquel modo de vivir tan peligroso, así para el alma
como para el cuerpo; pero, como los más eran gascones, gente rústica y
desbaratada, no les entraba bien la plática de don Quijote. Llegado que fue
Roque, preguntó a Sancho Panza si le habían vuelto y restituido las alhajas
y preseas que los suyos del rucio le habían quitado. Sancho respondió que
sí, sino que le faltaban tres tocadores, que valían tres ciudades.
— ¿Qué es lo que dices, hombre? —dijo uno de los presentes—, que yo los
tengo, y no valen tres reales.
— Así es —dijo don Quijote—, pero estímalos mi escudero en lo que ha dicho,
por habérmelos dado quien me los dio.
Mandóselos volver al punto Roque Guinart, y, mandando poner los suyos en
ala, mandó traer allí delante todos los vestidos, joyas, y dineros, y todo
aquello que desde la última repartición habían robado; y, haciendo
brevemente el tanteo, volviendo lo no repartible y reduciéndolo a dineros,
lo repartió por toda su compañía, con tanta legalidad y prudencia que no
pasó un punto ni defraudó nada de la justicia distributiva. Hecho esto, con
lo cual todos quedaron contentos, satisfechos y pagados, dijo Roque a don
Quijote:
— Si no se guardase esta puntualidad con éstos, no se podría vivir con
ellos.
A lo que dijo Sancho:
— Según lo que aquí he visto, es tan buena la justicia, que es necesaria que
se use aun entre los mesmos ladrones.
Oyólo un escudero, y enarboló el mocho de un arcabuz, con el cual, sin
duda, le abriera la cabeza a Sancho, si Roque Guinart no le diera voces que
se detuviese. Pasmóse Sancho, y propuso de no descoser los labios en tanto
que entre aquella gente estuviese.
Llegó, en esto, uno o algunos de aquellos escuderos que estaban puestos por
centinelas por los caminos para ver la gente que por ellos venía y dar
aviso a su mayor de lo que pasaba, y éste dijo:
— Señor, no lejos de aquí, por el camino que va a Barcelona, viene un gran
tropel de gente.
A lo que respondió Roque:
— ¿Has echado de ver si son de los que nos buscan, o de los que nosotros
buscamos?
— No, sino de los que buscamos —respondió el escudero.
— Pues salid todos —replicó Roque—, y traédmelos aquí luego, sin que se os
escape ninguno.
Hiciéronlo así, y, quedándose solos don Quijote, Sancho y Roque, aguardaron
a ver lo que los escuderos traían; y, en este entretanto, dijo Roque a don
Quijote:
— Nueva manera de vida le debe de parecer al señor don Quijote la nuestra,
nuevas aventuras, nuevos sucesos, y todos peligrosos; y no me maravillo que
así le parezca, porque realmente le confieso que no hay modo de vivir más
inquieto ni más sobresaltado que el nuestro. A mí me han puesto en él no sé
qué deseos de venganza, que tienen fuerza de turbar los más sosegados
corazones; yo, de mi natural, soy compasivo y bien intencionado; pero, como
tengo dicho, el querer vengarme de un agravio que se me hizo, así da con
todas mis buenas inclinaciones en tierra, que persevero en este estado, a
despecho y pesar de lo que entiendo; y, como un abismo llama a otro y un
pecado a otro pecado, hanse eslabonado las venganzas de manera que no sólo
las mías, pero las ajenas tomo a mi cargo; pero Dios es servido de que,
aunque me veo en la mitad del laberinto de mis confusiones, no pierdo la
esperanza de salir dél a puerto seguro.
Admirado quedó don Quijote de oír hablar a Roque tan buenas y concertadas
razones, porque él se pensaba que, entre los de oficios semejantes de
robar, matar y saltear no podía haber alguno que tuviese buen discurso, y
respondióle:
— Señor Roque, el principio de la salud está en conocer la enfermedad y en
querer tomar el enfermo las medicinas que el médico le ordena: vuestra
merced está enfermo, conoce su dolencia, y el cielo, o Dios, por mejor
decir, que es nuestro médico, le aplicará medicinas que le sanen, las
cuales suelen sanar poco a poco y no de repente y por milagro; y más, que
los pecadores discretos están más cerca de enmendarse que los simples; y,
pues vuestra merced ha mostrado en sus razones su prudencia, no hay sino
tener buen ánimo y esperar mejoría de la enfermedad de su conciencia; y si
vuestra merced quiere ahorrar camino y ponerse con facilidad en el de su
salvación, véngase conmigo, que yo le enseñaré a ser caballero andante,
donde se pasan tantos trabajos y desventuras que, tomándolas por
penitencia, en dos paletas le pondrán en el cielo.
Rióse Roque del consejo de don Quijote, a quien, mudando plática, contó el
trágico suceso de Claudia Jerónima, de que le pesó en estremo a Sancho, que
no le había parecido mal la belleza, desenvoltura y brío de la moza.
Llegaron, en esto, los escuderos de la presa, trayendo consigo dos
caballeros a caballo, y dos peregrinos a pie, y un coche de mujeres con
hasta seis criados, que a pie y a caballo las acompañaban, con otros dos
mozos de mulas que los caballeros traían. Cogiéronlos los escuderos en
medio, guardando vencidos y vencedores gran silencio, esperando a que el
gran Roque Guinart hablase, el cual preguntó a los caballeros que quién
eran y adónde iban, y qué dinero llevaban. Uno dellos le respondió:
— Señor, nosotros somos dos capitanes de infantería española; tenemos
nuestras compañías en Nápoles y vamos a embarcarnos en cuatro galeras, que
dicen están en Barcelona con orden de pasar a Sicilia; llevamos hasta
docientos o trecientos escudos, con que, a nuestro parecer, vamos ricos y
contentos, pues la estrecheza ordinaria de los soldados no permite mayores
tesoros.
Preguntó Roque a los peregrinos lo mesmo que a los capitanes; fuele
respondido que iban a embarcarse para pasar a Roma, y que entre entrambos
podían llevar hasta sesenta reales. Quiso saber también quién iba en el
coche, y adónde, y el dinero que llevaban; y uno de los de a caballo dijo:
— Mi señora doña Guiomar de Quiñones, mujer del regente de la Vicaría de
Nápoles, con una hija pequeña, una doncella y una dueña, son las que van en
el coche; acompañámosla seis criados, y los dineros son seiscientos
escudos.
— De modo —dijo Roque Guinart—, que ya tenemos aquí novecientos escudos y
sesenta reales; mis soldados deben de ser hasta sesenta; mírese a cómo le
cabe a cada uno, porque yo soy mal contador.
Oyendo decir esto los salteadores, levantaron la voz, diciendo:
— ¡Viva Roque Guinart muchos años, a pesar de los lladres que su perdición
procuran!
Mostraron afligirse los capitanes, entristecióse la señora regenta, y no se
holgaron nada los peregrinos, viendo la confiscación de sus bienes. Túvolos
así un rato suspensos Roque, pero no quiso que pasase adelante su tristeza,
que ya se podía conocer a tiro de arcabuz, y, volviéndose a los capitanes,
dijo:
— Vuesas mercedes, señores capitanes, por cortesía, sean servidos de
prestarme sesenta escudos, y la señora regenta ochenta, para contentar
esta escuadra que me acompaña, porque el abad, de lo que canta yanta, y
luego puédense ir su camino libre y desembarazadamente, con un salvoconduto
que yo les daré, para que, si toparen otras de algunas escuadras mías que
tengo divididas por estos contornos, no les hagan daño; que no es mi
intención de agraviar a soldados ni a mujer alguna, especialmente a las que
son principales.
Infinitas y bien dichas fueron las razones con que los capitanes
agradecieron a Roque su cortesía y liberalidad, que, por tal la tuvieron,
en dejarles su mismo dinero. La señora doña Guiomar de Quiñones se quiso
arrojar del coche para besar los pies y las manos del gran Roque, pero él
no lo consintió en ninguna manera; antes le pidió perdón del agravio que le
hacía, forzado de cumplir con las obligaciones precisas de su mal oficio.
Mandó la señora regenta a un criado suyo diese luego los ochenta escudos
que le habían repartido, y ya los capitanes habían desembolsado los
sesenta. Iban los peregrinos a dar toda su miseria, pero Roque les dijo que
se estuviesen quedos, y volviéndose a los suyos, les dijo:
— Destos escudos dos tocan a cada uno, y sobran veinte: los diez se den a
estos peregrinos, y los otros diez a este buen escudero, porque pueda decir
bien de esta aventura.
Y, trayéndole aderezo de escribir, de que siempre andaba proveído, Roque
les dio por escrito un salvoconduto para los mayorales de sus escuadras, y,
despidiéndose dellos, los dejó ir libres, y admirados de su nobleza, de su
gallarda disposición y estraño proceder, teniéndole más por un Alejandro
Magno que por ladrón conocido. Uno de los escuderos dijo en su lengua
gascona y catalana:
— Este nuestro capitán más es para frade que para bandolero: si de aquí
adelante quisiere mostrarse liberal séalo con su hacienda y no con la
nuestra.
No lo dijo tan paso el desventurado que dejase de oírlo Roque, el cual,
echando mano a la espada, le abrió la cabeza casi en dos partes,
diciéndole:
— Desta manera castigo yo a los deslenguados y atrevidos.
Pasmáronse todos, y ninguno le osó decir palabra: tanta era la obediencia
que le tenían.
Apartóse Roque a una parte y escribió una carta a un su amigo, a Barcelona,
dándole aviso como estaba consigo el famoso don Quijote de la Mancha, aquel
caballero andante de quien tantas cosas se decían; y que le hacía saber que
era el más gracioso y el más entendido hombre del mundo, y que de allí a
cuatro días, que era el de San Juan Bautista, se le pondría en mitad de la
playa de la ciudad, armado de todas sus armas, sobre Rocinante, su caballo,
y a su escudero Sancho sobre un asno, y que diese noticia desto a sus
amigos los Niarros, para que con él se solazasen; que él quisiera que
carecieran deste gusto los Cadells, sus contrarios, pero que esto era
imposible, a causa que las locuras y discreciones de don Quijote y los
donaires de su escudero Sancho Panza no podían dejar de dar gusto general a
todo el mundo. Despachó estas cartas con uno de sus escuderos, que, mudando
el traje de bandolero en el de un labrador, entró en Barcelona y la dio a
quien iba.
Capítulo LXI. De lo que le sucedió a don Quijote en la entrada de
Barcelona, con otras cosas que tienen más de lo verdadero que de lo
discreto
Tres días y tres noches estuvo don Quijote con Roque, y si estuviera
trecientos años, no le faltara qué mirar y admirar en el modo de su vida:
aquí amanecían, acullá comían; unas veces huían, sin saber de quién, y
otras esperaban, sin saber a quién. Dormían en pie, interrompiendo el
sueño, mudándose de un lugar a otro. Todo era poner espías, escuchar
centinelas, soplar las cuerdas de los arcabuces, aunque traían pocos,
porque todos se servían de pedreñales. Roque pasaba las noches apartado de
los suyos, en partes y lugares donde ellos no pudiesen saber dónde estaba;
porque los muchos bandos que el visorrey de Barcelona había echado sobre su
vida le traían inquieto y temeroso, y no se osaba fiar de ninguno, temiendo
que los mismos suyos, o le habían de matar, o entregar a la justicia: vida,
por cierto, miserable y enfadosa.
En fin, por caminos desusados, por atajos y sendas encubiertas, partieron
Roque, don Quijote y Sancho con otros seis escuderos a Barcelona. Llegaron
a su playa la víspera de San Juan en la noche, y, abrazando Roque a don
Quijote y a Sancho, a quien dio los diez escudos prometidos, que hasta
entonces no se los había dado, los dejó, con mil ofrecimientos que de la
una a la otra parte se hicieron.
Volvióse Roque; quedóse don Quijote esperando el día, así, a caballo, como
estaba, y no tardó mucho cuando comenzó a descubrirse por los balcones del
Oriente la faz de la blanca aurora, alegrando las yerbas y las flores, en
lugar de alegrar el oído; aunque al mesmo instante alegraron también el
oído el son de muchas chirimías y atabales, ruido de cascabeles, ''¡trapa,
trapa, aparta, aparta!'' de corredores, que, al parecer, de la ciudad
salían. Dio lugar la aurora al sol, que, un rostro mayor que el de una
rodela, por el más bajo horizonte, poco a poco, se iba levantando.
Tendieron don Quijote y Sancho la vista por todas partes: vieron el mar,
hasta entonces dellos no visto; parecióles espaciosísimo y largo, harto más
que las lagunas de Ruidera, que en la Mancha habían visto; vieron las
galeras que estaban en la playa, las cuales, abatiendo las tiendas, se
descubrieron llenas de flámulas y gallardetes, que tremolaban al viento y
besaban y barrían el agua; dentro sonaban clarines, trompetas y chirimías,
que cerca y lejos llenaban el aire de suaves y belicosos acentos.
Comenzaron a moverse y a hacer modo de escaramuza por las sosegadas aguas,
correspondiéndoles casi al mismo modo infinitos caballeros que de la ciudad
sobre hermosos caballos y con vistosas libreas salían. Los soldados de las
galeras disparaban infinita artillería, a quien respondían los que estaban
en las murallas y fuertes de la ciudad, y la artillería gruesa con
espantoso estruendo rompía los vientos, a quien respondían los cañones de
crujía de las galeras. El mar alegre, la tierra jocunda, el aire claro,
sólo tal vez turbio del humo de la artillería, parece que iba infundiendo y
engendrando gusto súbito en todas las gentes.
No podía imaginar Sancho cómo pudiesen tener tantos pies aquellos bultos
que por el mar se movían. En esto, llegaron corriendo, con grita, lililíes
y algazara, los de las libreas adonde don Quijote suspenso y atónito
estaba, y uno dellos, que era el avisado de Roque, dijo en alta voz a don
Quijote:
— Bien sea venido a nuestra ciudad el espejo, el farol, la estrella y el
norte de toda la caballería andante, donde más largamente se contiene. Bien
sea venido, digo, el valeroso don Quijote de la Mancha: no el falso, no el
ficticio, no el apócrifo que en falsas historias estos días nos han
mostrado, sino el verdadero, el legal y el fiel que nos describió Cide
Hamete Benengeli, flor de los historiadores.
No respondió don Quijote palabra, ni los caballeros esperaron a que la
respondiese, sino, volviéndose y revolviéndose con los demás que los
seguían, comenzaron a hacer un revuelto caracol al derredor de don Quijote;
el cual, volviéndose a Sancho, dijo:
— Éstos bien nos han conocido: yo apostaré que han leído nuestra historia y
aun la del aragonés recién impresa.
Volvió otra vez el caballero que habló a don Quijote, y díjole:
— Vuesa merced, señor don Quijote, se venga con nosotros, que todos somos
sus servidores y grandes amigos de Roque Guinart.
A lo que don Quijote respondió:
— Si cortesías engendran cortesías, la vuestra, señor caballero, es hija o
parienta muy cercana de las del gran Roque. Llevadme do quisiéredes, que yo
no tendré otra voluntad que la vuestra, y más si la queréis ocupar en
vuestro servicio.
Con palabras no menos comedidas que éstas le respondió el caballero, y,
encerrándole todos en medio, al son de las chirimías y de los atabales, se
encaminaron con él a la ciudad, al entrar de la cual, el malo, que todo lo
malo ordena, y los muchachos, que son más malos que el malo, dos dellos
traviesos y atrevidos se entraron por toda la gente, y, alzando el uno de
la cola del rucio y el otro la de Rocinante, les pusieron y encajaron
sendos manojos de aliagas. Sintieron los pobres animales las nuevas
espuelas, y, apretando las colas, aumentaron su disgusto, de manera que,
dando mil corcovos, dieron con sus dueños en tierra. Don Quijote, corrido y
afrentado, acudió a quitar el plumaje de la cola de su matalote, y Sancho,
el de su rucio. Quisieran los que guiaban a don Quijote castigar el
atrevimiento de los muchachos, y no fue posible, porque se encerraron entre
más de otros mil que los seguían.
Volvieron a subir don Quijote y Sancho; con el mismo aplauso y música
llegaron a la casa de su guía, que era grande y principal, en fin, como de
caballero rico; donde le dejaremos por agora, porque así lo quiere Cide
Hamete.
Capítulo LXII. Que trata de la aventura de la cabeza encantada, con otras
niñerías que no pueden dejar de contarse
Don Antonio Moreno se llamaba el huésped de don Quijote, caballero rico y
discreto, y amigo de holgarse a lo honesto y afable, el cual, viendo en su
casa a don Quijote, andaba buscando modos como, sin su perjuicio, sacase a
plaza sus locuras; porque no son burlas las que duelen, ni hay pasatiempos
que valgan si son con daño de tercero. Lo primero que hizo fue hacer
desarmar a don Quijote y sacarle a vistas con aquel su estrecho y acamuzado
vestido —como ya otras veces le hemos descrito y pintado— a un balcón que
salía a una calle de las más principales de la ciudad, a vista de las
gentes y de los muchachos, que como a mona le miraban. Corrieron de nuevo
delante dél los de las libreas, como si para él solo, no para alegrar aquel
festivo día, se las hubieran puesto; y Sancho estaba contentísimo, por
parecerle que se había hallado, sin saber cómo ni cómo no, otras bodas de
Camacho, otra casa como la de don Diego de Miranda y otro castillo como el
del duque.
Comieron aquel día con don Antonio algunos de sus amigos, honrando todos y
tratando a don Quijote como a caballero andante, de lo cual, hueco y
pomposo, no cabía en sí de contento. Los donaires de Sancho fueron tantos,
que de su boca andaban como colgados todos los criados de casa y todos
cuantos le oían. Estando a la mesa, dijo don Antonio a Sancho:
— Acá tenemos noticia, buen Sancho, que sois tan amigo de manjar blanco y de
albondiguillas, que, si os sobran, las guardáis en el seno para el otro
día.
— No, señor, no es así —respondió Sancho—, porque tengo más de limpio que de
goloso, y mi señor don Quijote, que está delante, sabe bien que con un puño
de bellotas, o de nueces, nos solemos pasar entrambos ocho días. Verdad es
que si tal vez me sucede que me den la vaquilla, corro con la soguilla;
quiero decir que como lo que me dan, y uso de los tiempos como los hallo; y
quienquiera que hubiere dicho que yo soy comedor aventajado y no limpio,
téngase por dicho que no acierta; y de otra manera dijera esto si no mirara
a las barbas honradas que están a la mesa.
— Por cierto —dijo don Quijote—, que la parsimonia y limpieza con que Sancho
come se puede escribir y grabar en láminas de bronce, para que quede en
memoria eterna de los siglos venideros. Verdad es que, cuando él tiene
hambre, parece algo tragón, porque come apriesa y masca a dos carrillos;
pero la limpieza siempre la tiene en su punto, y en el tiempo que fue
gobernador aprendió a comer a lo melindroso: tanto, que comía con tenedor
las uvas y aun los granos de la granada.
— ¡Cómo! —dijo don Antonio—. ¿Gobernador ha sido Sancho?
— Sí —respondió Sancho—, y de una ínsula llamada la Barataria. Diez días la
goberné a pedir de boca; en ellos perdí el sosiego, y aprendí a despreciar
todos los gobiernos del mundo; salí huyendo della, caí en una cueva, donde
me tuve por muerto, de la cual salí vivo por milagro.
Contó don Quijote por menudo todo el suceso del gobierno de Sancho, con que
dio gran gusto a los oyentes.
Levantados los manteles, y tomando don Antonio por la mano a don Quijote,
se entró con él en un apartado aposento, en el cual no había otra cosa de
adorno que una mesa, al parecer de jaspe, que sobre un pie de lo mesmo se
sostenía, sobre la cual estaba puesta, al modo de las cabezas de los
emperadores romanos, de los pechos arriba, una que semejaba ser de bronce.
Paseóse don Antonio con don Quijote por todo el aposento, rodeando muchas
veces la mesa, después de lo cual dijo:
— Agora, señor don Quijote, que estoy enterado que no nos oye y escucha
alguno, y está cerrada la puerta, quiero contar a vuestra merced una de las
más raras aventuras, o, por mejor decir, novedades que imaginarse pueden,
con condición que lo que a vuestra merced dijere lo ha de depositar en los
últimos retretes del secreto.
— Así lo juro —respondió don Quijote—, y aun le echaré una losa encima, para
más seguridad; porque quiero que sepa vuestra merced, señor don Antonio
— que ya sabía su nombre—, que está hablando con quien, aunque tiene oídos
para oír, no tiene lengua para hablar; así que, con seguridad puede vuestra
merced trasladar lo que tiene en su pecho en el mío y hacer cuenta que lo
ha arrojado en los abismos del silencio.
— En fee de esa promesa —respondió don Antonio—, quiero poner a vuestra
merced en admiración con lo que viere y oyere, y darme a mí algún alivio de
la pena que me causa no tener con quien comunicar mis secretos, que no son
para fiarse de todos.
Suspenso estaba don Quijote, esperando en qué habían de parar tantas
prevenciones. En esto, tomándole la mano don Antonio, se la paseó por la
cabeza de bronce y por toda la mesa, y por el pie de jaspe sobre que se
sostenía, y luego dijo:
— Esta cabeza, señor don Quijote, ha sido hecha y fabricada por uno de los
mayores encantadores y hechiceros que ha tenido el mundo, que creo era
polaco de nación y dicípulo del famoso Escotillo, de quien tantas
maravillas se cuentan; el cual estuvo aquí en mi casa, y por precio de mil
escudos que le di, labró esta cabeza, que tiene propiedad y virtud de
responder a cuantas cosas al oído le preguntaren. Guardó rumbos, pintó
carácteres, observó astros, miró puntos, y, finalmente, la sacó con la
perfeción que veremos mañana, porque los viernes está muda, y hoy, que lo
es, nos ha de hacer esperar hasta mañana. En este tiempo podrá vuestra
merced prevenirse de lo que querrá preguntar, que por esperiencia sé que
dice verdad en cuanto responde.
Admirado quedó don Quijote de la virtud y propiedad de la cabeza, y estuvo
por no creer a don Antonio; pero, por ver cuán poco tiempo había para hacer
la experiencia, no quiso decirle otra cosa sino que le agradecía el haberle
descubierto tan gran secreto. Salieron del aposento, cerró la puerta don
Antonio con llave, y fuéronse a la sala, donde los demás caballeros
estaban. En este tiempo les había contado Sancho muchas de las aventuras y
sucesos que a su amo habían acontecido.
Aquella tarde sacaron a pasear a don Quijote, no armado, sino de rúa,
vestido un balandrán de paño leonado, que pudiera hacer sudar en aquel
tiempo al mismo yelo. Ordenaron con sus criados que entretuviesen a Sancho
de modo que no le dejasen salir de casa. Iba don Quijote, no sobre
Rocinante, sino sobre un gran macho de paso llano, y muy bien aderezado.
Pusiéronle el balandrán, y en las espaldas, sin que lo viese, le cosieron
un pargamino, donde le escribieron con letras grandes: Éste es don Quijote
de la Mancha. En comenzando el paseo, llevaba el rétulo los ojos de cuantos
venían a verle, y como leían: Éste es don Quijote de la Mancha, admirábase
don Quijote de ver que cuantos le miraban le nombraban y conocían; y,
volviéndose a don Antonio, que iba a su lado, le dijo:
— Grande es la prerrogativa que encierra en sí la andante caballería, pues
hace conocido y famoso al que la profesa por todos los términos de la
tierra; si no, mire vuestra merced, señor don Antonio, que hasta los
muchachos desta ciudad, sin nunca haberme visto, me conocen.
— Así es, señor don Quijote —respondió don Antonio—, que, así como el fuego
no puede estar escondido y encerrado, la virtud no puede dejar de ser
conocida, y la que se alcanza por la profesión de las armas resplandece y
campea sobre todas las otras.
Acaeció, pues, que, yendo don Quijote con el aplauso que se ha dicho, un
castellano que leyó el rétulo de las espaldas, alzó la voz, diciendo:
— ¡Válgate el diablo por don Quijote de la Mancha! ¿Cómo que hasta aquí has
llegado, sin haberte muerto los infinitos palos que tienes a cuestas? Tu
eres loco, y si lo fueras a solas y dentro de las puertas de tu locura,
fuera menos mal; pero tienes propiedad de volver locos y mentecatos a
cuantos te tratan y comunican; si no, mírenlo por estos señores que te
acompañan. Vuélvete, mentecato, a tu casa, y mira por tu hacienda, por tu
mujer y tus hijos, y déjate destas vaciedades que te carcomen el seso y te
desnatan el entendimiento.
— Hermano —dijo don Antonio—, seguid vuestro camino, y no deis consejos a
quien no os los pide. El señor don Quijote de la Mancha es muy cuerdo, y
nosotros, que le acompañamos, no somos necios; la virtud se ha de honrar
dondequiera que se hallare, y andad en hora mala, y no os metáis donde no
os llaman.
— Pardiez, vuesa merced tiene razón —respondió el castellano—, que aconsejar
a este buen hombre es dar coces contra el aguijón; pero, con todo eso, me
da muy gran lástima que el buen ingenio que dicen que tiene en todas las
cosas este mentecato se le desagüe por la canal de su andante caballería; y
la enhoramala que vuesa merced dijo, sea para mí y para todos mis
descendientes si de hoy más, aunque viviese más años que Matusalén, diere
consejo a nadie, aunque me lo pida.
Apartóse el consejero; siguió adelante el paseo; pero fue tanta la priesa
que los muchachos y toda la gente tenía leyendo el rétulo, que se le hubo
de quitar don Antonio, como que le quitaba otra cosa.
Llegó la noche, volviéronse a casa; hubo sarao de damas, porque la mujer de
don Antonio, que era una señora principal y alegre, hermosa y discreta,
convidó a otras sus amigas a que viniesen a honrar a su huésped y a gustar
de sus nunca vistas locuras. Vinieron algunas, cenóse espléndidamente y
comenzóse el sarao casi a las diez de la noche. Entre las damas había dos
de gusto pícaro y burlonas, y, con ser muy honestas, eran algo
descompuestas, por dar lugar que las burlas alegrasen sin enfado. Éstas
dieron tanta priesa en sacar a danzar a don Quijote, que le molieron, no
sólo el cuerpo, pero el ánima. Era cosa de ver la figura de don Quijote,
largo, tendido, flaco, amarillo, estrecho en el vestido, desairado, y,
sobre todo, no nada ligero. Requebrábanle como a hurto las damiselas, y él,
también como a hurto, las desdeñaba; pero, viéndose apretar de requiebros,
alzó la voz y dijo:
— Fugite, partes adversae!: dejadme en mi sosiego, pensamientos mal venidos.
Allá os avenid, señoras, con vuestros deseos, que la que es reina de los
míos, la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso, no consiente que ningunos otros que
los suyos me avasallen y rindan.
Y, diciendo esto, se sentó en mitad de la sala, en el suelo, molido y
quebrantado de tan bailador ejercicio. Hizo don Antonio que le llevasen en
peso a su lecho, y el primero que asió dél fue Sancho, diciéndole:
— ¡Nora en tal, señor nuestro amo, lo habéis bailado! ¿Pensáis que todos los
valientes son danzadores y todos los andantes caballeros bailarines? Digo
que si lo pensáis, que estáis engañado; hombre hay que se atreverá a matar
a un gigante antes que hacer una cabriola. Si hubiérades de zapatear, yo
supliera vuestra falta, que zapateo como un girifalte; pero en lo del
danzar, no doy puntada.
Con estas y otras razones dio que reír Sancho a los del sarao, y dio con su
amo en la cama, arropándole para que sudase la frialdad de su baile.
Otro día le pareció a don Antonio ser bien hacer la experiencia de la
cabeza encantada, y con don Quijote, Sancho y otros dos amigos, con las dos
señoras que habían molido a don Quijote en el baile, que aquella propia
noche se habían quedado con la mujer de don Antonio, se encerró en la
estancia donde estaba la cabeza. Contóles la propiedad que tenía,
encargóles el secreto y díjoles que aquél era el primero día donde se había
de probar la virtud de la tal cabeza encantada; y si no eran los dos amigos
de don Antonio, ninguna otra persona sabía el busilis del encanto, y aun si
don Antonio no se le hubiera descubierto primero a sus amigos, también
ellos cayeran en la admiración en que los demás cayeron, sin ser posible
otra cosa: con tal traza y tal orden estaba fabricada.
El primero que se llegó al oído de la cabeza fue el mismo don Antonio, y
díjole en voz sumisa, pero no tanto que de todos no fuese entendida:
— Dime, cabeza, por la virtud que en ti se encierra: ¿qué pensamientos tengo
yo agora?
Y la cabeza le respondió, sin mover los labios, con voz clara y distinta,
de modo que fue de todos entendida, esta razón:
— Yo no juzgo de pensamientos.
Oyendo lo cual, todos quedaron atónitos, y más viendo que en todo el
aposento ni al derredor de la mesa no había persona humana que responder
pudiese.
— ¿Cuántos estamos aquí? —tornó a preguntar don Antonio.
Y fuele respondido por el propio tenor, paso:
— Estáis tú y tu mujer, con dos amigos tuyos, y dos amigas della, y un
caballero famoso llamado don Quijote de la Mancha, y un su escudero que
Sancho Panza tiene por nombre.
¡Aquí sí que fue el admirarse de nuevo, aquí sí que fue el erizarse los
cabellos a todos de puro espanto! Y, apartándose don Antonio de la cabeza,
dijo:
— Esto me basta para darme a entender que no fui engañado del que te me
vendió, ¡cabeza sabia, cabeza habladora, cabeza respondona y admirable
cabeza! Llegue otro y pregúntele lo que quisiere.
Y, como las mujeres de ordinario son presurosas y amigas de saber, la
primera que se llegó fue una de las dos amigas de la mujer de don Antonio,
y lo que le preguntó fue:
— Dime, cabeza, ¿qué haré yo para ser muy hermosa?
Y fuele respondido:
— Sé muy honesta.
— No te pregunto más —dijo la preguntanta.
Llegó luego la compañera, y dijo:
— Querría saber, cabeza, si mi marido me quiere bien, o no.
Y respondiéronle:
— Mira las obras que te hace, y echarlo has de ver.
Apartóse la casada diciendo:
— Esta respuesta no tenía necesidad de pregunta, porque, en efecto, las
obras que se hacen declaran la voluntad que tiene el que las hace.
Luego llegó uno de los dos amigos de don Antonio, y preguntóle:
— ¿Quién soy yo?
Y fuele respondido:
— Tú lo sabes.
— No te pregunto eso —respondió el caballero—, sino que me digas si me
conoces tú.
— Sí conozco —le respondieron—, que eres don Pedro Noriz.
— No quiero saber más, pues esto basta para entender, ¡oh cabeza!, que lo
sabes todo.
Y, apartándose, llegó el otro amigo y preguntóle:
— Dime, cabeza, ¿qué deseos tiene mi hijo el mayorazgo?
— Ya yo he dicho —le respondieron— que yo no juzgo de deseos, pero, con todo
eso, te sé decir que los que tu hijo tiene son de enterrarte.
— Eso es —dijo el caballero—: lo que veo por los ojos, con el dedo lo
señalo.
Y no preguntó más. Llegóse la mujer de don Antonio, y dijo:
— Yo no sé, cabeza, qué preguntarte; sólo querría saber de ti si gozaré
muchos años de buen marido.
Y respondiéronle:
— Sí gozarás, porque su salud y su templanza en el vivir prometen muchos
años de vida, la cual muchos suelen acortar por su destemplanza.
Llegóse luego don Quijote, y dijo:
— Dime tú, el que respondes: ¿fue verdad o fue sueño lo que yo cuento que me
pasó en la cueva de Montesinos? ¿Serán ciertos los azotes de Sancho mi
escudero? ¿Tendrá efeto el desencanto de Dulcinea?
— A lo de la cueva —respondieron— hay mucho que decir: de todo tiene; los
azotes de Sancho irán de espacio, el desencanto de Dulcinea llegará a
debida ejecución.
— No quiero saber más —dijo don Quijote—; que como yo vea a Dulcinea
desencantada, haré cuenta que vienen de golpe todas las venturas que
acertare a desear.
El último preguntante fue Sancho, y lo que preguntó fue:
— ¿Por ventura, cabeza, tendré otro gobierno? ¿Saldré de la estrecheza de
escudero? ¿Volveré a ver a mi mujer y a mis hijos?
A lo que le respondieron:
— Gobernarás en tu casa; y si vuelves a ella, verás a tu mujer y a tus
hijos; y, dejando de servir, dejarás de ser escudero.
— ¡Bueno, par Dios! —dijo Sancho Panza—. Esto yo me lo dijera: no dijera más
el profeta Perogrullo.
— Bestia —dijo don Quijote—, ¿qué quieres que te respondan? ¿No basta que
las respuestas que esta cabeza ha dado correspondan a lo que se le
pregunta?
— Sí basta —respondió Sancho—, pero quisiera yo que se declarara más y me
dijera más.
Con esto se acabaron las preguntas y las respuestas, pero no se acabó la
admiración en que todos quedaron, excepto los dos amigos de don Antonio,
que el caso sabían. El cual quiso Cide Hamete Benengeli declarar luego, por
no tener suspenso al mundo, creyendo que algún hechicero y extraordinario
misterio en la tal cabeza se encerraba; y así, dice que don Antonio Moreno,
a imitación de otra cabeza que vio en Madrid, fabricada por un estampero,
hizo ésta en su casa, para entretenerse y suspender a los ignorantes; y la
fábrica era de esta suerte: la tabla de la mesa era de palo, pintada y
barnizada como jaspe, y el pie sobre que se sostenía era de lo mesmo, con
cuatro garras de águila que dél salían, para mayor firmeza del peso. La
cabeza, que parecía medalla y figura de emperador romano, y de color de
bronce, estaba toda hueca, y ni más ni menos la tabla de la mesa, en que se
encajaba tan justamente, que ninguna señal de juntura se parecía. El pie de
la tabla era ansimesmo hueco, que respondía a la garganta y pechos de la
cabeza, y todo esto venía a responder a otro aposento que debajo de la
estancia de la cabeza estaba. Por todo este hueco de pie, mesa, garganta y
pechos de la medalla y figura referida se encaminaba un cañón de hoja de
lata, muy justo, que de nadie podía ser visto. En el aposento de abajo
correspondiente al de arriba se ponía el que había de responder, pegada la
boca con el mesmo cañón, de modo que, a modo de cerbatana, iba la voz de
arriba abajo y de abajo arriba, en palabras articuladas y claras; y de esta
manera no era posible conocer el embuste. Un sobrino de don Antonio,
estudiante agudo y discreto, fue el respondiente; el cual, estando avisado
de su señor tío de los que habían de entrar con él en aquel día en el
aposento de la cabeza, le fue fácil responder con presteza y puntualidad a
la primera pregunta; a las demás respondió por conjeturas, y, como
discreto, discretamente. Y dice más Cide Hamete: que hasta diez o doce días
duró esta maravillosa máquina; pero que, divulgándose por la ciudad que don
Antonio tenía en su casa una cabeza encantada, que a cuantos le preguntaban
respondía, temiendo no llegase a los oídos de las despiertas centinelas de
nuestra Fe, habiendo declarado el caso a los señores inquisidores, le
mandaron que lo deshiciese y no pasase más adelante, porque el vulgo
ignorante no se escandalizase; pero en la opinión de don Quijote y de
Sancho Panza, la cabeza quedó por encantada y por respondona, más a
satisfación de don Quijote que de Sancho.
Los caballeros de la ciudad, por complacer a don Antonio y por agasajar a
don Quijote y dar lugar a que descubriese sus sandeces, ordenaron de correr
sortija de allí a seis días; que no tuvo efecto por la ocasión que se dirá
adelante. Diole gana a don Quijote de pasear la ciudad a la llana y a pie,
temiendo que, si iba a caballo, le habían de perseguir los mochachos, y
así, él y Sancho, con otros dos criados que don Antonio le dio, salieron a
pasearse.
Sucedió, pues, que, yendo por una calle, alzó los ojos don Quijote, y vio
escrito sobre una puerta, con letras muy grandes: Aquí se imprimen libros;
de lo que se contentó mucho, porque hasta entonces no había visto emprenta
alguna, y deseaba saber cómo fuese. Entró dentro, con todo su
acompañamiento, y vio tirar en una parte, corregir en otra, componer en
ésta, enmendar en aquélla, y, finalmente, toda aquella máquina que en las
emprentas grandes se muestra. Llegábase don Quijote a un cajón y preguntaba
qué era aquéllo que allí se hacía; dábanle cuenta los oficiales, admirábase
y pasaba adelante. Llegó en otras a uno, y preguntóle qué era lo que hacía.
El oficial le respondió:
— Señor, este caballero que aquí está —y enseñóle a un hombre de muy buen
talle y parecer y de alguna gravedad— ha traducido un libro toscano en
nuestra lengua castellana, y estoyle yo componiendo, para darle a la
estampa.
— ¿Qué título tiene el libro? —preguntó don Quijote.
— A lo que el autor respondió:
— Señor, el libro, en toscano, se llama Le bagatele.
— Y ¿qué responde le bagatele en nuestro castellano? —preguntó don Quijote.
— Le bagatele —dijo el autor— es como si en castellano dijésemos los
juguetes; y, aunque este libro es en el nombre humilde, contiene y
encierra en sí cosas muy buenas y sustanciales.
— Yo —dijo don Quijote— sé algún tanto de el toscano, y me precio de cantar
algunas estancias del Ariosto. Pero dígame vuesa merced, señor mío, y no
digo esto porque quiero examinar el ingenio de vuestra merced, sino por
curiosidad no más: ¿ha hallado en su escritura alguna vez nombrar piñata?
— Sí, muchas veces —respondió el autor.
— Y ¿cómo la traduce vuestra merced en castellano? —preguntó don Quijote.
— ¿Cómo la había de traducir —replicó el autor—, sino diciendo olla?
— ¡Cuerpo de tal —dijo don Quijote—, y qué adelante está vuesa merced en el
toscano idioma! Yo apostaré una buena apuesta que adonde diga en el toscano
piache, dice vuesa merced en el castellano place; y adonde diga più, dice
más, y el su declara con arriba, y el giù con abajo.
— Sí declaro, por cierto —dijo el autor—, porque ésas son sus propias
correspondencias.
— Osaré yo jurar —dijo don Quijote— que no es vuesa merced conocido en el
mundo, enemigo siempre de premiar los floridos ingenios ni los loables
trabajos. ¡Qué de habilidades hay perdidas por ahí! ¡Qué de ingenios
arrinconados! ¡Qué de virtudes menospreciadas! Pero, con todo esto, me
parece que el traducir de una lengua en otra, como no sea de las reinas de
las lenguas, griega y latina, es como quien mira los tapices flamencos por
el revés, que, aunque se veen las figuras, son llenas de hilos que las
escurecen, y no se veen con la lisura y tez de la haz; y el traducir de
lenguas fáciles, ni arguye ingenio ni elocución, como no le arguye el que
traslada ni el que copia un papel de otro papel. Y no por esto quiero
inferir que no sea loable este ejercicio del traducir; porque en otras
cosas peores se podría ocupar el hombre, y que menos provecho le trujesen.
Fuera desta cuenta van los dos famosos traductores: el uno, el doctor
Cristóbal de Figueroa, en su Pastor Fido, y el otro, don Juan de Jáurigui,
en su Aminta, donde felizmente ponen en duda cuál es la tradución o cuál el
original. Pero dígame vuestra merced: este libro, ¿imprímese por su cuenta,
o tiene ya vendido el privilegio a algún librero?
— Por mi cuenta lo imprimo —respondió el autor—, y pienso ganar mil ducados,
por lo menos, con esta primera impresión, que ha de ser de dos mil cuerpos,
y se han de despachar a seis reales cada uno, en daca las pajas.
— ¡Bien está vuesa merced en la cuenta! —respondió don Quijote—. Bien parece
que no sabe las entradas y salidas de los impresores, y las
correspondencias que hay de unos a otros; yo le prometo que, cuando se vea
cargado de dos mil cuerpos de libros, vea tan molido su cuerpo, que se
espante, y más si el libro es un poco avieso y no nada picante.
— Pues, ¿qué? —dijo el autor—. ¿Quiere vuesa merced que se lo dé a un
librero, que me dé por el privilegio tres maravedís, y aún piensa que me
hace merced en dármelos? Yo no imprimo mis libros para alcanzar fama en el
mundo, que ya en él soy conocido por mis obras: provecho quiero, que sin él
no vale un cuatrín la buena fama.
— Dios le dé a vuesa merced buena manderecha —respondió don Quijote.
Y pasó adelante a otro cajón, donde vio que estaban corrigiendo un pliego
de un libro que se intitulaba Luz del alma; y,en viéndole, dijo:
— Estos tales libros, aunque hay muchos deste género, son los que se deben
imprimir, porque son muchos los pecadores que se usan, y son menester
infinitas luces para tantos desalumbrados.
Pasó adelante y vio que asimesmo estaban corrigiendo otro libro; y,
preguntando su título, le respondieron que se llamaba la Segunda parte del
Ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha, compuesta por un tal vecino de
Tordesillas.
— Ya yo tengo noticia deste libro —dijo don Quijote—, y en verdad y en mi
conciencia que pensé que ya estaba quemado y hecho polvos, por
impertinente; pero su San Martín se le llegará, como a cada puerco, que las
historias fingidas tanto tienen de buenas y de deleitables cuanto se llegan
a la verdad o la semejanza della, y las verdaderas tanto son mejores cuanto
son más verdaderas.
Y, diciendo esto, con muestras de algún despecho, se salió de la emprenta.
Y aquel mesmo día ordenó don Antonio de llevarle a ver las galeras que en
la playa estaban, de que Sancho se regocijó mucho, a causa que en su vida
las había visto. Avisó don Antonio al cuatralbo de las galeras como aquella
tarde había de llevar a verlas a su huésped el famoso don Quijote de la
Mancha, de quien ya el cuatralbo y todos los vecinos de la ciudad tenían
noticia; y lo que le sucedió en ellas se dirá en el siguiente capítulo.
Capítulo LXIII. De lo mal que le avino a Sancho Panza con la visita de las
galeras, y la nueva aventura de la hermosa morisca
Grandes eran los discursos que don Quijote hacía sobre la respuesta de la
encantada cabeza, sin que ninguno dellos diese en el embuste, y todos
paraban con la promesa, que él tuvo por cierto, del desencanto de Dulcinea.
Allí iba y venía, y se alegraba entre sí mismo, creyendo que había de ver
presto su cumplimiento; y Sancho, aunque aborrecía el ser gobernador, como
queda dicho, todavía deseaba volver a mandar y a ser obedecido; que esta
mala ventura trae consigo el mando, aunque sea de burlas.
En resolución, aquella tarde don Antonio Moreno, su huésped, y sus dos
amigos, con don Quijote y Sancho, fueron a las galeras. El cuatralbo, que
estaba avisado de su buena venida, por ver a los dos tan famosos Quijote y
Sancho, apenas llegaron a la marina, cuando todas las galeras abatieron
tienda, y sonaron las chirimías; arrojaron luego el esquife al agua,
cubierto de ricos tapetes y de almohadas de terciopelo carmesí, y, en
poniendo que puso los pies en él don Quijote, disparó la capitana el cañón
de crujía, y las otras galeras hicieron lo mesmo, y, al subir don Quijote
por la escala derecha, toda la chusma le saludó como es usanza cuando una
persona principal entra en la galera, diciendo: ''¡Hu, hu, hu!'' tres
veces. Diole la mano el general, que con este nombre le llamaremos, que era
un principal caballero valenciano; abrazó a don Quijote, diciéndole:
— Este día señalaré yo con piedra blanca, por ser uno de los mejores que
pienso llevar en mi vida, habiendo visto al señor don Quijote de la Mancha:
tiempo y señal que nos muestra que en él se encierra y cifra todo el valor
del andante caballería.
Con otras no menos corteses razones le respondió don Quijote, alegre
sobremanera de verse tratar tan a lo señor. Entraron todos en la popa, que
estaba muy bien aderezada, y sentáronse por los bandines, pasóse el cómitre
en crujía, y dio señal con el pito que la chusma hiciese fuera ropa, que se
hizo en un instante. Sancho, que vio tanta gente en cueros, quedó pasmado,
y más cuando vio hacer tienda con tanta priesa, que a él le pareció que
todos los diablos andaban allí trabajando; pero esto todo fueron tortas y
pan pintado para lo que ahora diré. Estaba Sancho sentado sobre el
estanterol, junto al espalder de la mano derecha, el cual ya avisado de lo
que había de hacer, asió de Sancho, y, levantándole en los brazos, toda la
chusma puesta en pie y alerta, comenzando de la derecha banda, le fue dando
y volteando sobre los brazos de la chusma de banco en banco, con tanta
priesa, que el pobre Sancho perdió la vista de los ojos, y sin duda pensó
que los mismos demonios le llevaban, y no pararon con él hasta volverle por
la siniestra banda y ponerle en la popa. Quedó el pobre molido, y jadeando,
y trasudando, sin poder imaginar qué fue lo que sucedido le había.
Don Quijote, que vio el vuelo sin alas de Sancho, preguntó al general si
eran ceremonias aquéllas que se usaban con los primeros que entraban en las
galeras; porque si acaso lo fuese, él, que no tenía intención de profesar
en ellas, no quería hacer semejantes ejercicios, y que votaba a Dios que,
si alguno llegaba a asirle para voltearle, que le había de sacar el alma a
puntillazos; y, diciendo esto, se levantó en pie y empuñó la espada.
A este instante abatieron tienda, y con grandísimo ruido dejaron caer la
entena de alto abajo. Pensó Sancho que el cielo se desencajaba de sus
quicios y venía a dar sobre su cabeza; y, agobiándola, lleno de miedo, la
puso entre las piernas. No las tuvo todas consigo don Quijote; que también
se estremeció y encogió de hombros y perdió la color del rostro. La chusma
izó la entena con la misma priesa y ruido que la habían amainado, y todo
esto, callando, como si no tuvieran voz ni aliento. Hizo señal el cómitre
que zarpasen el ferro, y, saltando en mitad de la crujía con el corbacho o
rebenque, comenzó a mosquear las espaldas de la chusma, y a largarse poco a
poco a la mar. Cuando Sancho vio a una moverse tantos pies colorados, que
tales pensó él que eran los remos, dijo entre sí:
— Éstas sí son verdaderamente cosas encantadas, y no las que mi amo dice.
¿Qué han hecho estos desdichados, que ansí los azotan, y cómo este hombre
solo, que anda por aquí silbando, tiene atrevimiento para azotar a tanta
gente? Ahora yo digo que éste es infierno, o, por lo menos, el purgatorio.
Don Quijote, que vio la atención con que Sancho miraba lo que pasaba, le
dijo:
— ¡Ah Sancho amigo, y con qué brevedad y cuán a poca costa os podíades vos,
si quisiésedes, desnudar de medio cuerpo arriba, y poneros entre estos
señores, y acabar con el desencanto de Dulcinea! Pues con la miseria y pena
de tantos, no sentiríades vos mucho la vuestra; y más, que podría ser que
el sabio Merlín tomase en cuenta cada azote déstos, por ser dados de buena
mano, por diez de los que vos finalmente os habéis de dar.
Preguntar quería el general qué azotes eran aquéllos, o qué desencanto de
Dulcinea, cuando dijo el marinero:
— Señal hace Monjuí de que hay bajel de remos en la costa por la banda del
poniente.
Esto oído, saltó el general en la crujía, y dijo:
— ¡Ea hijos, no se nos vaya! Algún bergantín de cosarios de Argel debe de
ser éste que la atalaya nos señala.
Llegáronse luego las otras tres galeras a la capitana, a saber lo que se
les ordenaba. Mandó el general que las dos saliesen a la mar, y él con la
otra iría tierra a tierra, porque ansí el bajel no se les escaparía. Apretó
la chusma los remos, impeliendo las galeras con tanta furia, que parecía
que volaban. Las que salieron a la mar, a obra de dos millas descubrieron
un bajel, que con la vista le marcaron por de hasta catorce o quince
bancos, y así era la verdad; el cual bajel, cuando descubrió las galeras,
se puso en caza, con intención y esperanza de escaparse por su ligereza;
pero avínole mal, porque la galera capitana era de los más ligeros bajeles
que en la mar navegaban, y así le fue entrando, que claramente los del
bergantín conocieron que no podían escaparse; y así, el arráez quisiera que
dejaran los remos y se entregaran, por no irritar a enojo al capitán que
nuestras galeras regía. Pero la suerte, que de otra manera lo guiaba,
ordenó que, ya que la capitana llegaba tan cerca que podían los del bajel
oír las voces que desde ella les decían que se rindiesen, dos toraquís, que
es como decir dos turcos borrachos, que en el bergantín venían con estos
doce, dispararon dos escopetas, con que dieron muerte a dos soldados que
sobre nuestras arrumbadas venían. Viendo lo cual, juró el general de no
dejar con vida a todos cuantos en el bajel tomase, y, llegando a embestir
con toda furia, se le escapó por debajo de la palamenta. Pasó la galera
adelante un buen trecho; los del bajel se vieron perdidos, hicieron vela en
tanto que la galera volvía, y de nuevo, a vela y a remo, se pusieron en
caza; pero no les aprovechó su diligencia tanto como les dañó su
atrevimiento, porque, alcanzándoles la capitana a poco más de media milla,
les echó la palamenta encima y los cogió vivos a todos.
Llegaron en esto las otras dos galeras, y todas cuatro con la presa
volvieron a la playa, donde infinita gente los estaba esperando, deseosos
de ver lo que traían. Dio fondo el general cerca de tierra, y conoció que
estaba en la marina el virrey de la ciudad. Mandó echar el esquife para
traerle, y mandó amainar la entena para ahorcar luego luego al arráez y a
los demás turcos que en el bajel había cogido, que serían hasta treinta y
seis personas, todos gallardos, y los más, escopeteros turcos. Preguntó el
general quién era el arráez del bergantín y fuele respondido por uno de los
cautivos, en lengua castellana, que después pareció ser renegado español:
— Este mancebo, señor, que aquí vees es nuestro arráez.
Y mostróle uno de los más bellos y gallardos mozos que pudiera pintar la
humana imaginación. La edad, al parecer, no llegaba a veinte años.
Preguntóle el general:
— Dime, mal aconsejado perro, ¿quién te movió a matarme mis soldados, pues
veías ser imposible el escaparte? ¿Ese respeto se guarda a las capitanas?
¿No sabes tú que no es valentía la temeridad? Las esperanzas dudosas han de
hacer a los hombres atrevidos, pero no temerarios.
Responder quería el arráez; pero no pudo el general, por entonces, oír la
respuesta, por acudir a recebir al virrey, que ya entraba en la galera, con
el cual entraron algunos de sus criados y algunas personas del pueblo.
— ¡Buena ha estado la caza, señor general! —dijo el virrey.
— Y tan buena —respondió el general— cual la verá Vuestra Excelencia agora
colgada de esta entena.
— ¿Cómo ansí? —replicó el virrey.
— Porque me han muerto —respondió el general—, contra toda ley y contra toda
razón y usanza de guerra, dos soldados de los mejores que en estas galeras
venían, y yo he jurado de ahorcar a cuantos he cautivado, principalmente a
este mozo, que es el arráez del bergantín.
Y enseñóle al que ya tenía atadas las manos y echado el cordel a la
garganta, esperando la muerte.
Miróle el virrey, y, viéndole tan hermoso, y tan gallardo, y tan humilde,
dándole en aquel instante una carta de recomendación su hermosura, le vino
deseo de escusar su muerte; y así, le preguntó:
— Dime, arráez, ¿eres turco de nación, o moro, o renegado?
A lo cual el mozo respondió, en lengua asimesmo castellana:
— Ni soy turco de nación, ni moro, ni renegado.
— Pues, ¿qué eres? —replicó el virrey.
— Mujer cristiana —respondió el mancebo.
— ¿Mujer y cristiana, y en tal traje y en tales pasos? Más es cosa para
admirarla que para creerla.
— Suspended —dijo el mozo—, ¡oh señores!, la ejecución de mi muerte, que no
se perderá mucho en que se dilate vuestra venganza en tanto que yo os
cuente mi vida.
¿Quién fuera el de corazón tan duro que con estas razones no se ablandara,
o, a lo menos, hasta oír las que el triste y lastimado mancebo decir
quería? El general le dijo que dijese lo que quisiese, pero que no esperase
alcanzar perdón de su conocida culpa. Con esta licencia, el mozo comenzó a
decir desta manera:
— «De aquella nación más desdichada que prudente, sobre quien ha llovido
estos días un mar de desgracias, nací yo, de moriscos padres engendrada. En
la corriente de su desventura fui yo por dos tíos míos llevada a Berbería,
sin que me aprovechase decir que era cristiana, como, en efecto, lo soy, y
no de las fingidas ni aparentes, sino de las verdaderas y católicas. No me
valió, con los que tenían a cargo nuestro miserable destierro, decir esta
verdad, ni mis tíos quisieron creerla; antes la tuvieron por mentira y por
invención para quedarme en la tierra donde había nacido, y así, por fuerza
más que por grado, me trujeron consigo. Tuve una madre cristiana y un padre
discreto y cristiano, ni más ni menos; mamé la fe católica en la leche;
criéme con buenas costumbres; ni en la lengua ni en ellas jamás, a mi
parecer, di señales de ser morisca. Al par y al paso destas virtudes, que
yo creo que lo son, creció mi hermosura, si es que tengo alguna; y, aunque
mi recato y mi encerramiento fue mucho, no debió de ser tanto que no
tuviese lugar de verme un mancebo caballero, llamado don Gaspar Gregorio,
hijo mayorazgo de un caballero que junto a nuestro lugar otro suyo tiene.
Cómo me vio, cómo nos hablamos, cómo se vio perdido por mí y cómo yo no muy
ganada por él, sería largo de contar, y más en tiempo que estoy temiendo
que, entre la lengua y la garganta, se ha de atravesar el riguroso cordel
que me amenaza; y así, sólo diré cómo en nuestro destierro quiso
acompañarme don Gregorio. Mezclóse con los moriscos que de otros lugares
salieron, porque sabía muy bien la lengua, y en el viaje se hizo amigo de
dos tíos míos que consigo me traían; porque mi padre, prudente y prevenido,
así como oyó el primer bando de nuestro destierro, se salió del lugar y se
fue a buscar alguno en los reinos estraños que nos acogiese. Dejó
encerradas y enterradas, en una parte de quien yo sola tengo noticia,
muchas perlas y piedras de gran valor, con algunos dineros en cruzados y
doblones de oro. Mandóme que no tocase al tesoro que dejaba en ninguna
manera, si acaso antes que él volviese nos desterraban. Hícelo así, y con
mis tíos, como tengo dicho, y otros parientes y allegados pasamos a
Berbería; y el lugar donde hicimos asiento fue en Argel, como si le
hiciéramos en el mismo infierno. Tuvo noticia el rey de mi hermosura, y la
fama se la dio de mis riquezas, que, en parte, fue ventura mía. Llamóme
ante sí, preguntóme de qué parte de España era y qué dineros y qué joyas
traía. Díjele el lugar, y que las joyas y dineros quedaban en él
enterrados, pero que con facilidad se podrían cobrar si yo misma volviese
por ellos. Todo esto le dije, temerosa de que no le cegase mi hermosura,
sino su codicia. Estando conmigo en estas pláticas, le llegaron a decir
cómo venía conmigo uno de los más gallardos y hermosos mancebos que se
podía imaginar. Luego entendí que lo decían por don Gaspar Gregorio, cuya
belleza se deja atrás las mayores que encarecer se pueden. Turbéme,
considerando el peligro que don Gregorio corría, porque entre aquellos
bárbaros turcos en más se tiene y estima un mochacho o mancebo hermoso que
una mujer, por bellísima que sea. Mandó luego el rey que se le trujesen
allí delante para verle, y preguntóme si era verdad lo que de aquel mozo le
decían. Entonces yo, casi como prevenida del cielo, le dije que sí era;
pero que le hacía saber que no era varón, sino mujer como yo, y que le
suplicaba me la dejase ir a vestir en su natural traje, para que de todo en
todo mostrase su belleza y con menos empacho pareciese ante su presencia.
Díjome que fuese en buena hora, y que otro día hablaríamos en el modo que
se podía tener para que yo volviese a España a sacar el escondido tesoro.
Hablé con don Gaspar, contéle el peligro que corría el mostrar ser hombre;
vestíle de mora, y aquella mesma tarde le truje a la presencia del rey, el
cual, en viéndole, quedó admirado y hizo disignio de guardarla para hacer
presente della al Gran Señor; y, por huir del peligro que en el serrallo de
sus mujeres podía tener y temer de sí mismo, la mandó poner en casa de unas
principales moras que la guardasen y la sirviesen, adonde le llevaron
luego. Lo que los dos sentimos (que no puedo negar que no le quiero) se
deje a la consideración de los que se apartan si bien se quieren. Dio luego
traza el rey de que yo volviese a España en este bergantín y que me
acompañasen dos turcos de nación, que fueron los que mataron vuestros
soldados. Vino también conmigo este renegado español —señalando al que
había hablado primero—, del cual sé yo bien que es cristiano encubierto y
que viene con más deseo de quedarse en España que de volver a Berbería; la
demás chusma del bergantín son moros y turcos, que no sirven de más que de
bogar al remo. Los dos turcos, codiciosos e insolentes, sin guardar el
orden que traíamos de que a mí y a este renegado en la primer parte de
España, en hábito de cristianos, de que venimos proveídos, nos echasen en
tierra, primero quisieron barrer esta costa y hacer alguna presa, si
pudiesen, temiendo que si primero nos echaban en tierra, por algún acidente
que a los dos nos sucediese, podríamos descubrir que quedaba el bergantín
en la mar, y si acaso hubiese galeras por esta costa, los tomasen. Anoche
descubrimos esta playa, y, sin tener noticia destas cuatro galeras,
fuimos descubiertos, y nos ha sucedido lo que habéis visto. En resolución:
don Gregorio queda en hábito de mujer entre mujeres, con manifiesto peligro
de perderse, y yo me veo atadas las manos, esperando, o, por mejor decir,
temiendo perder la vida, que ya me cansa.» Éste es, señores, el fin de mi
lamentable historia, tan verdadera como desdichada; lo que os ruego es que
me dejéis morir como cristiana, pues, como ya he dicho, en ninguna cosa he
sido culpante de la culpa en que los de mi nación han caído.
Y luego calló, preñados los ojos de tiernas lágrimas, a quien acompañaron
muchas de los que presentes estaban. El virrey, tierno y compasivo, sin
hablarle palabra, se llegó a ella y le quitó con sus manos el cordel que
las hermosas de la mora ligaba.
En tanto, pues, que la morisca cristiana su peregrina historia trataba,
tuvo clavados los ojos en ella un anciano peregrino que entró en la galera
cuando entró el virrey; y, apenas dio fin a su plática la morisca, cuando
él se arrojó a sus pies, y, abrazado dellos, con interrumpidas palabras de
mil sollozos y suspiros, le dijo:
— ¡Oh Ana Félix, desdichada hija mía! Yo soy tu padre Ricote, que volvía a
buscarte por no poder vivir sin ti, que eres mi alma.
A cuyas palabras abrió los ojos Sancho, y alzó la cabeza (que inclinada
tenía, pensando en la desgracia de su paseo), y, mirando al peregrino,
conoció ser el mismo Ricote que topó el día que salió de su gobierno, y
confirmóse que aquélla era su hija, la cual, ya desatada, abrazó a su
padre, mezclando sus lágrimas con las suyas; el cual dijo al general y al
virrey:
— Ésta, señores, es mi hija, más desdichada en sus sucesos que en su nombre.
Ana Félix se llama, con el sobrenombre de Ricote, famosa tanto por su
hermosura como por mi riqueza. Yo salí de mi patria a buscar en reinos
estraños quien nos albergase y recogiese, y, habiéndole hallado en
Alemania, volví en este hábito de peregrino, en compañía de otros alemanes,
a buscar mi hija y a desenterrar muchas riquezas que dejé escondidas. No
hallé a mi hija; hallé el tesoro, que conmigo traigo, y agora, por el
estraño rodeo que habéis visto, he hallado el tesoro que más me enriquece,
que es a mi querida hija. Si nuestra poca culpa y sus lágrimas y las mías,
por la integridad de vuestra justicia, pueden abrir puertas a la
misericordia, usadla con nosotros, que jamás tuvimos pensamiento de
ofenderos, ni convenimos en ningún modo con la intención de los nuestros,
que justamente han sido desterrados.
Entonces dijo Sancho:
— Bien conozco a Ricote, y sé que es verdad lo que dice en cuanto a ser Ana
Félix su hija; que en esotras zarandajas de ir y venir, tener buena o mala
intención, no me entremeto.
Admirados del estraño caso todos los presentes, el general dijo:
— Una por una vuestras lágrimas no me dejarán cumplir mi juramento: vivid,
hermosa Ana Félix, los años de vida que os tiene determinados el cielo, y
lleven la pena de su culpa los insolentes y atrevidos que la cometieron.
Y mandó luego ahorcar de la entena a los dos turcos que a sus dos soldados
habían muerto; pero el virrey le pidió encarecidamente no los ahorcase,
pues más locura que valentía había sido la suya. Hizo el general lo que el
virrey le pedía, porque no se ejecutan bien las venganzas a sangre helada.
Procuraron luego dar traza de sacar a don Gaspar Gregorio del peligro en
que quedaba. Ofreció Ricote para ello más de dos mil ducados que en perlas
y en joyas tenía. Diéronse muchos medios, pero ninguno fue tal como el que
dio el renegado español que se ha dicho, el cual se ofreció de volver a
Argel en algún barco pequeño, de hasta seis bancos, armado de remeros
cristianos, porque él sabía dónde, cómo y cuándo podía y debía desembarcar,
y asimismo no ignoraba la casa donde don Gaspar quedaba. Dudaron el general
y el virrey el fiarse del renegado, ni confiar de los cristianos que habían
de bogar el remo; fióle Ana Félix, y Ricote, su padre, dijo que salía a dar
el rescate de los cristianos, si acaso se perdiesen.
Firmados, pues, en este parecer, se desembarcó el virrey, y don Antonio
Moreno se llevó consigo a la morisca y a su padre, encargándole el virrey
que los regalase y acariciase cuanto le fuese posible; que de su parte le
ofrecía lo que en su casa hubiese para su regalo. Tanta fue la benevolencia
y caridad que la hermosura de Ana Félix infundió en su pecho.
Capítulo LXIV. Que trata de la aventura que más pesadumbre dio a don
Quijote de cuantas hasta entonces le habían sucedido
La mujer de don Antonio Moreno cuenta la historia que recibió grandísimo
contento de ver a Ana Félix en su casa. Recibióla con mucho agrado, así
enamorada de su belleza como de su discreción, porque en lo uno y en lo
otro era estremada la morisca, y toda la gente de la ciudad, como a campana
tañida, venían a verla.
Dijo don Quijote a don Antonio que el parecer que habían tomado en la
libertad de don Gregorio no era bueno, porque tenía más de peligroso que de
conveniente, y que sería mejor que le pusiesen a él en Berbería con sus
armas y caballo; que él le sacaría a pesar de toda la morisma, como había
hecho don Gaiferos a su esposa Melisendra.
— Advierta vuesa merced —dijo Sancho, oyendo esto— que el señor don Gaiferos
sacó a sus esposa de tierra firme y la llevó a Francia por tierra firme;
pero aquí, si acaso sacamos a don Gregorio, no tenemos por dónde traerle a
España, pues está la mar en medio.
— Para todo hay remedio, si no es para la muerte —respondió don Quijote—;
pues, llegando el barco a la marina, nos podremos embarcar en él, aunque
todo el mundo lo impida.
— Muy bien lo pinta y facilita vuestra merced —dijo Sancho—, pero del dicho
al hecho hay gran trecho, y yo me atengo al renegado, que me parece muy
hombre de bien y de muy buenas entrañas.
Don Antonio dijo que si el renegado no saliese bien del caso, se tomaría el
espediente de que el gran don Quijote pasase en Berbería.
De allí a dos días partió el renegado en un ligero barco de seis remos por
banda, armado de valentísima chusma; y de allí a otros dos se partieron las
galeras a Levante, habiendo pedido el general al visorrey fuese servido de
avisarle de lo que sucediese en la libertad de don Gregorio y en el caso de
Ana Félix; quedó el visorrey de hacerlo así como se lo pedía.
Y una mañana, saliendo don Quijote a pasearse por la playa armado de todas
sus armas, porque, como muchas veces decía, ellas eran sus arreos, y su
descanso el pelear, y no se hallaba sin ellas un punto, vio venir hacía él
un caballero, armado asimismo de punta en blanco, que en el escudo traía
pintada una luna resplandeciente; el cual, llegándose a trecho que podía
ser oído, en altas voces, encaminando sus razones a don Quijote, dijo:
— Insigne caballero y jamás como se debe alabado don Quijote de la Mancha,
yo soy el Caballero de la Blanca Luna, cuyas inauditas hazañas quizá te le
habrán traído a la memoria. Vengo a contender contigo y a probar la fuerza
de tus brazos, en razón de hacerte conocer y confesar que mi dama, sea
quien fuere, es sin comparación más hermosa que tu Dulcinea del Toboso; la
cual verdad si tú la confiesas de llano en llano, escusarás tu muerte y el
trabajo que yo he de tomar en dártela; y si tú peleares y yo te venciere,
no quiero otra satisfación sino que, dejando las armas y absteniéndote de
buscar aventuras, te recojas y retires a tu lugar por tiempo de un año,
donde has de vivir sin echar mano a la espada, en paz tranquila y en
provechoso sosiego, porque así conviene al aumento de tu hacienda y a la
salvación de tu alma; y si tú me vencieres, quedará a tu discreción mi
cabeza, y serán tuyos los despojos de mis armas y caballo, y pasará a la
tuya la fama de mis hazañas. Mira lo que te está mejor, y respóndeme luego,
porque hoy todo el día traigo de término para despachar este negocio.
Don Quijote quedó suspenso y atónito, así de la arrogancia del Caballero de
la Blanca Luna como de la causa por que le desafiaba; y con reposo y ademán
severo le respondió:
— Caballero de la Blanca Luna, cuyas hazañas hasta agora no han llegado a mi
noticia, yo osaré jurar que jamás habéis visto a la ilustre Dulcinea; que
si visto la hubiérades, yo sé que procurárades no poneros en esta demanda,
porque su vista os desengañara de que no ha habido ni puede haber belleza
que con la suya comparar se pueda; y así, no diciéndoos que mentís, sino
que no acertáis en lo propuesto, con las condiciones que habéis referido,
aceto vuestro desafío, y luego, porque no se pase el día que traéis
determinado; y sólo exceto de las condiciones la de que se pase a mí la
fama de vuestras hazañas, porque no sé cuáles ni qué tales sean: con las
mías me contento, tales cuales ellas son. Tomad, pues, la parte del campo
que quisiéredes, que yo haré lo mesmo, y a quien Dios se la diere, San
Pedro se la bendiga.
Habían descubierto de la ciudad al Caballero de la Blanca Luna, y díchoselo
al visorrey que estaba hablando con don Quijote de la Mancha. El visorrey,
creyendo sería alguna nueva aventura fabricada por don Antonio Moreno, o
por otro algún caballero de la ciudad, salió luego a la playa con don
Antonio y con otros muchos caballeros que le acompañaban, a tiempo cuando
don Quijote volvía las riendas a Rocinante para tomar del campo lo
necesario.
Viendo, pues, el visorrey que daban los dos señales de volverse a
encontrar, se puso en medio, preguntándoles qué era la causa que les movía
a hacer tan de improviso batalla. El Caballero de la Blanca Luna respondió
que era precedencia de hermosura, y en breves razones le dijo las mismas
que había dicho a don Quijote, con la acetación de las condiciones del
desafío hechas por entrambas partes. Llegóse el visorrey a don Antonio, y
preguntóle paso si sabía quién era el tal Caballero de la Blanca Luna, o si
era alguna burla que querían hacer a don Quijote. Don Antonio le respondió
que ni sabía quién era, ni si era de burlas ni de veras el tal desafío.
Esta respuesta tuvo perplejo al visorrey en si les dejaría o no pasar
adelante en la batalla; pero, no pudiéndose persuadir a que fuese sino
burla, se apartó diciendo:
— Señores caballeros, si aquí no hay otro remedio sino confesar o morir, y
el señor don Quijote está en sus trece y vuestra merced el de la Blanca
Luna en sus catorce, a la mano de Dios, y dense.
Agradeció el de la Blanca Luna con corteses y discretas razones al visorrey
la licencia que se les daba, y don Quijote hizo lo mesmo; el cual,
encomendándose al cielo de todo corazón y a su Dulcinea —como tenía de
costumbre al comenzar de las batallas que se le ofrecían—, tornó a tomar
otro poco más del campo, porque vio que su contrario hacía lo mesmo, y, sin
tocar trompeta ni otro instrumento bélico que les diese señal de arremeter,
volvieron entrambos a un mesmo punto las riendas a sus caballos; y, como
era más ligero el de la Blanca Luna, llegó a don Quijote a dos tercios
andados de la carrera, y allí le encontró con tan poderosa fuerza, sin
tocarle con la lanza (que la levantó, al parecer, de propósito), que dio
con Rocinante y con don Quijote por el suelo una peligrosa caída. Fue luego
sobre él, y, poniéndole la lanza sobre la visera, le dijo:
— Vencido sois, caballero, y aun muerto, si no confesáis las condiciones de
nuestro desafío.
Don Quijote, molido y aturdido, sin alzarse la visera, como si hablara
dentro de una tumba, con voz debilitada y enferma, dijo:
— Dulcinea del Toboso es la más hermosa mujer del mundo, y yo el más
desdichado caballero de la tierra, y no es bien que mi flaqueza defraude
esta verdad. Aprieta, caballero, la lanza, y quítame la vida, pues me has
quitado la honra.
— Eso no haré yo, por cierto —dijo el de la Blanca Luna—: viva, viva en su
entereza la fama de la hermosura de la señora Dulcinea del Toboso, que sólo
me contento con que el gran don Quijote se retire a su lugar un año, o
hasta el tiempo que por mí le fuere mandado, como concertamos antes de
entrar en esta batalla.
Todo esto oyeron el visorrey y don Antonio, con otros muchos que allí
estaban, y oyeron asimismo que don Quijote respondió que como no le pidiese
cosa que fuese en perjuicio de Dulcinea, todo lo demás cumpliría como
caballero puntual y verdadero.
Hecha esta confesión, volvió las riendas el de la Blanca Luna, y, haciendo
mesura con la cabeza al visorrey, a medio galope se entró en la ciudad.
Mandó el visorrey a don Antonio que fuese tras él, y que en todas maneras
supiese quién era. Levantaron a don Quijote, descubriéronle el rostro y
halláronle sin color y trasudando. Rocinante, de puro malparado, no se pudo
mover por entonces. Sancho, todo triste, todo apesarado, no sabía qué
decirse ni qué hacerse: parecíale que todo aquel suceso pasaba en sueños y
que toda aquella máquina era cosa de encantamento. Veía a su señor rendido
y obligado a no tomar armas en un año; imaginaba la luz de la gloria de sus
hazañas escurecida, las esperanzas de sus nuevas promesas deshechas, como
se deshace el humo con el viento. Temía si quedaría o no contrecho
Rocinante, o deslocado su amo; que no fuera poca ventura si deslocado
quedara. Finalmente, con una silla de manos, que mandó traer el visorrey,
le llevaron a la ciudad, y el visorrey se volvió también a ella, con deseo
de saber quién fuese el Caballero de la Blanca Luna, que de tan mal talante
había dejado a don Quijote.
Capítulo LXV. Donde se da noticia quién era el de la Blanca Luna, con la
libertad de Don Gregorio, y de otros sucesos
Siguió don Antonio Moreno al Caballero de la Blanca Luna, y siguiéronle
también, y aun persiguiéronle, muchos muchachos, hasta que le cerraron en
un mesón dentro de la ciudad. Entró el don Antonio con deseo de conocerle;
salió un escudero a recebirle y a desarmarle; encerróse en una sala baja, y
con él don Antonio, que no se le cocía el pan hasta saber quién fuese.
Viendo, pues, el de la Blanca Luna que aquel caballero no le dejaba, le
dijo:
— Bien sé, señor, a lo que venís, que es a saber quién soy; y, porque no hay
para qué negároslo, en tanto que este mi criado me desarma os lo diré, sin
faltar un punto a la verdad del caso. Sabed, señor, que a mí me llaman el
bachiller Sansón Carrasco; soy del mesmo lugar de don Quijote de la Mancha,
cuya locura y sandez mueve a que le tengamos lástima todos cuantos le
conocemos, y entre los que más se la han tenido he sido yo; y, creyendo que
está su salud en su reposo y en que se esté en su tierra y en su casa, di
traza para hacerle estar en ella; y así, habrá tres meses que le salí al
camino como caballero andante, llamándome el Caballero de los Espejos, con
intención de pelear con él y vencerle, sin hacerle daño, poniendo por
condición de nuestra pelea que el vencido quedase a discreción del
vencedor; y lo que yo pensaba pedirle, porque ya le juzgaba por vencido,
era que se volviese a su lugar y que no saliese dél en todo un año, en el
cual tiempo podría ser curado; pero la suerte lo ordenó de otra manera,
porque él me venció a mí y me derribó del caballo, y así, no tuvo efecto mi
pensamiento: él prosiguió su camino, y yo me volví, vencido, corrido y
molido de la caída, que fue además peligrosa; pero no por esto se me quitó
el deseo de volver a buscarle y a vencerle, como hoy se ha visto. Y como él
es tan puntual en guardar las órdenes de la andante caballería, sin duda
alguna guardará la que le he dado, en cumplimiento de su palabra. Esto es,
señor, lo que pasa, sin que tenga que deciros otra cosa alguna; suplícoos
no me descubráis ni le digáis a don Quijote quién soy, porque tengan efecto
los buenos pensamientos míos y vuelva a cobrar su juicio un hombre que le
tiene bonísimo, como le dejen las sandeces de la caballería.
— ¡Oh señor —dijo don Antonio—, Dios os perdone el agravio que habéis hecho
a todo el mundo en querer volver cuerdo al más gracioso loco que hay en él!
¿No veis, señor, que no podrá llegar el provecho que cause la cordura de
don Quijote a lo que llega el gusto que da con sus desvaríos? Pero yo
imagino que toda la industria del señor bachiller no ha de ser parte para
volver cuerdo a un hombre tan rematadamente loco; y si no fuese contra
caridad, diría que nunca sane don Quijote, porque con su salud, no
solamente perdemos sus gracias, sino las de Sancho Panza, su escudero, que
cualquiera dellas puede volver a alegrar a la misma melancolía. Con todo
esto, callaré, y no le diré nada, por ver si salgo verdadero en sospechar
que no ha de tener efecto la diligencia hecha por el señor Carrasco.
El cual respondió que ya una por una estaba en buen punto aquel negocio, de
quien esperaba feliz suceso. Y, habiéndose ofrecido don Antonio de hacer lo
que más le mandase, se despidió dél; y, hecho liar sus armas sobre un
macho, luego al mismo punto, sobre el caballo con que entró en la batalla,
se salió de la ciudad aquel mismo día y se volvió a su patria, sin
sucederle cosa que obligue a contarla en esta verdadera historia.
Contó don Antonio al visorrey todo lo que Carrasco le había contado, de lo
que el visorrey no recibió mucho gusto, porque en el recogimiento de don
Quijote se perdía el que podían tener todos aquellos que de sus locuras
tuviesen noticia.
Seis días estuvo don Quijote en el lecho, marrido, triste, pensativo y mal
acondicionado, yendo y viniendo con la imaginación en el desdichado suceso
de su vencimiento. Consolábale Sancho, y, entre otras razones, le dijo:
— Señor mío, alce vuestra merced la cabeza y alégrese, si puede, y dé
gracias al cielo que, ya que le derribó en la tierra, no salió con alguna
costilla quebrada; y, pues sabe que donde las dan las toman, y que no
siempre hay tocinos donde hay estacas, dé una higa al médico, pues no le ha
menester para que le cure en esta enfermedad: volvámonos a nuestra casa y
dejémonos de andar buscando aventuras por tierras y lugares que no sabemos;
y, si bien se considera, yo soy aquí el más perdidoso, aunque es vuestra
merced el más mal parado. Yo, que dejé con el gobierno los deseos de ser
más gobernador, no dejé la gana de ser conde, que jamás tendrá efecto si
vuesa merced deja de ser rey, dejando el ejercicio de su caballería; y así,
vienen a volverse en humo mis esperanzas.
— Calla, Sancho, pues ves que mi reclusión y retirada no ha de pasar de un
año; que luego volveré a mis honrados ejercicios, y no me ha de faltar
reino que gane y algún condado que darte.
— Dios lo oiga —dijo Sancho—, y el pecado sea sordo, que siempre he oído
decir que más vale buena esperanza que ruin posesión.
En esto estaban cuando entró don Antonio, diciendo con muestras de
grandísimo contento:
— ¡Albricias, señor don Quijote, que don Gregorio y el renegado que fue por
él está en la playa! ¿Qué digo en la playa? Ya está en casa del visorrey, y
será aquí al momento.
Alegróse algún tanto don Quijote, y dijo:
— En verdad que estoy por decir que me holgara que hubiera sucedido todo al
revés, porque me obligara a pasar en Berbería, donde con la fuerza de mi
brazo diera libertad no sólo a don Gregorio, sino a cuantos cristianos
cautivos hay en Berbería. Pero, ¿qué digo, miserable? ¿No soy yo el
vencido? ¿No soy yo el derribado? ¿No soy yo el que no puede tomar arma en
un año? Pues, ¿qué prometo? ¿De qué me alabo, si antes me conviene usar de
la rueca que de la espada?
— Déjese deso, señor —dijo Sancho—: viva la gallina, aunque con su pepita,
que hoy por ti y mañana por mí; y en estas cosas de encuentros y porrazos
no hay tomarles tiento alguno, pues el que hoy cae puede levantarse
mañana, si no es que se quiere estar en la cama; quiero decir que se deje
desmayar, sin cobrar nuevos bríos para nuevas pendencias. Y levántese
vuestra merced agora para recebir a don Gregorio, que me parece que anda la
gente alborotada, y ya debe de estar en casa.
Y así era la verdad; porque, habiendo ya dado cuenta don Gregorio y el
renegado al visorrey de su ida y vuelta, deseoso don Gregorio de ver a Ana
Félix, vino con el renegado a casa de don Antonio; y, aunque don Gregorio,
cuando le sacaron de Argel, fue con hábitos de mujer, en el barco los trocó
por los de un cautivo que salió consigo; pero en cualquiera que viniera,
mostrara ser persona para ser codiciada, servida y estimada, porque era
hermoso sobremanera, y la edad, al parecer, de diez y siete o diez y ocho
años. Ricote y su hija salieron a recebirle: el padre con lágrimas y la
hija con honestidad. No se abrazaron unos a otros, porque donde hay mucho
amor no suele haber demasiada desenvoltura. Las dos bellezas juntas de don
Gregorio y Ana Félix admiraron en particular a todos juntos los que
presentes estaban. El silencio fue allí el que habló por los dos amantes, y
los ojos fueron las lenguas que descubrieron sus alegres y honestos
pensamientos.
Contó el renegado la industria y medio que tuvo para sacar a don Gregorio;
contó don Gregorio los peligros y aprietos en que se había visto con las
mujeres con quien había quedado, no con largo razonamiento, sino con breves
palabras, donde mostró que su discreción se adelantaba a sus años.
Finalmente, Ricote pagó y satisfizo liberalmente así al renegado como a los
que habían bogado al remo. Reincorporóse y redújose el renegado con la
Iglesia, y, de miembro podrido, volvió limpio y sano con la penitencia y el
arrepentimiento.
De allí a dos días trató el visorrey con don Antonio qué modo tendrían para
que Ana Félix y su padre quedasen en España, pareciéndoles no ser de
inconveniente alguno que quedasen en ella hija tan cristiana y padre, al
parecer, tan bien intencionado. Don Antonio se ofreció venir a la corte a
negociarlo, donde había de venir forzosamente a otros negocios, dando a
entender que en ella, por medio del favor y de las dádivas, muchas cosas
dificultosas se acaban.
— No —dijo Ricote, que se halló presente a esta plática— hay que esperar en
favores ni en dádivas, porque con el gran don Bernardino de Velasco, conde
de Salazar, a quien dio Su Majestad cargo de nuestra expulsión, no valen
ruegos, no promesas, no dádivas, no lástimas; porque, aunque es verdad que
él mezcla la misericordia con la justicia, como él vee que todo el cuerpo
de nuestra nación está contaminado y podrido, usa con él antes del cauterio
que abrasa que del ungüento que molifica; y así, con prudencia, con
sagacidad, con diligencia y con miedos que pone, ha llevado sobre sus
fuertes hombros a debida ejecución el peso desta gran máquina, sin que
nuestras industrias, estratagemas, solicitudes y fraudes hayan podido
deslumbrar sus ojos de Argos, que contino tiene alerta, porque no se le
quede ni encubra ninguno de los nuestros, que, como raíz escondida, que con
el tiempo venga después a brotar, y a echar frutos venenosos en España, ya
limpia, ya desembarazada de los temores en que nuestra muchedumbre la
tenía. ¡Heroica resolución del gran Filipo Tercero, y inaudita prudencia en
haberla encargado al tal don Bernardino de Velasco!
— Una por una, yo haré, puesto allá, las diligencias posibles, y haga el
cielo lo que más fuere servido —dijo don Antonio—. Don Gregorio se irá
conmigo a consolar la pena que sus padres deben tener por su ausencia; Ana
Félix se quedará con mi mujer en mi casa, o en un monasterio, y yo sé que
el señor visorrey gustará se quede en la suya el buen Ricote, hasta ver
cómo yo negocio.
El visorrey consintió en todo lo propuesto, pero don Gregorio, sabiendo lo
que pasaba, dijo que en ninguna manera podía ni quería dejar a doña Ana
Félix; pero, teniendo intención de ver a sus padres, y de dar traza de
volver por ella, vino en el decretado concierto. Quedóse Ana Félix con la
mujer de don Antonio, y Ricote en casa del visorrey.
Llegóse el día de la partida de don Antonio, y el de don Quijote y Sancho,
que fue de allí a otros dos; que la caída no le concedió que más presto se
pusiese en camino. Hubo lágrimas, hubo suspiros, desmayos y sollozos al
despedirse don Gregorio de Ana Félix. Ofrecióle Ricote a don Gregorio mil
escudos, si los quería; pero él no tomó ninguno, sino solos cinco que le
prestó don Antonio, prometiendo la paga dellos en la corte. Con esto, se
partieron los dos, y don Quijote y Sancho después, como se ha dicho: don
Quijote desarmado y de camino, Sancho a pie, por ir el rucio cargado con
las armas.
Capítulo LXVI. Que trata de lo que verá el que lo leyere, o lo oirá el que
lo escuchare leer
Al salir de Barcelona, volvió don Quijote a mirar el sitio donde había
caído, y dijo:
— ¡Aquí fue Troya! ¡Aquí mi desdicha, y no mi cobardía, se llevó mis
alcanzadas glorias; aquí usó la fortuna conmigo de sus vueltas y revueltas;
aquí se escurecieron mis hazañas; aquí, finalmente, cayó mi ventura para
jamás levantarse!
Oyendo lo cual Sancho, dijo:
— Tan de valientes corazones es, señor mío, tener sufrimiento en las
desgracias como alegría en las prosperidades; y esto lo juzgo por mí mismo,
que si cuando era gobernador estaba alegre, agora que soy escudero de a
pie, no estoy triste; porque he oído decir que esta que llaman por ahí
Fortuna es una mujer borracha y antojadiza, y, sobre todo, ciega, y así, no
vee lo que hace, ni sabe a quién derriba, ni a quién ensalza.
— Muy filósofo estás, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, muy a lo discreto
hablas: no sé quién te lo enseña. Lo que te sé decir es que no hay fortuna
en el mundo, ni las cosas que en él suceden, buenas o malas que sean,
vienen acaso, sino por particular providencia de los cielos, y de aquí
viene lo que suele decirse: que cada uno es artífice de su ventura. Yo lo
he sido de la mía, pero no con la prudencia necesaria, y así, me han salido
al gallarín mis presunciones; pues debiera pensar que al poderoso grandor
del caballo del de la Blanca Luna no podía resistir la flaqueza de
Rocinante. Atrevíme en fin, hice lo que puede, derribáronme, y, aunque
perdí la honra, no perdí, ni puedo perder, la virtud de cumplir mi palabra.
Cuando era caballero andante, atrevido y valiente, con mis obras y con mis
manos acreditaba mis hechos; y agora, cuando soy escudero pedestre,
acreditaré mis palabras cumpliendo la que di de mi promesa. Camina, pues,
amigo Sancho, y vamos a tener en nuestra tierra el año del noviciado, con
cuyo encerramiento cobraremos virtud nueva para volver al nunca de mí
olvidado ejercicio de las armas.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, no es cosa tan gustosa el caminar a pie, que me
mueva e incite a hacer grandes jornadas. Dejemos estas armas colgadas de
algún árbol, en lugar de un ahorcado, y, ocupando yo las espaldas del
rucio, levantados los pies del suelo, haremos las jornadas como vuestra
merced las pidiere y midiere; que pensar que tengo de caminar a pie y
hacerlas grandes es pensar en lo escusado.
— Bien has dicho, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—: cuélguense mis armas por
trofeo, y al pie dellas, o alrededor dellas, grabaremos en los árboles lo
que en el trofeo de las armas de Roldán estaba escrito:
Nadie las mueva
que estar no pueda con Roldán a prueba.
— Todo eso me parece de perlas —respondió Sancho—; y, si no fuera por la
falta que para el camino nos había de hacer Rocinante, también fuera bien
dejarle colgado.
— ¡Pues ni él ni las armas —replicó don Quijote— quiero que se ahorquen,
porque no se diga que a buen servicio, mal galardón!
— Muy bien dice vuestra merced —respondió Sancho—, porque, según opinión de
discretos, la culpa del asno no se ha de echar a la albarda; y, pues deste
suceso vuestra merced tiene la culpa, castíguese a sí mesmo, y no revienten
sus iras por las ya rotas y sangrientas armas, ni por las mansedumbres de
Rocinante, ni por la blandura de mis pies, queriendo que caminen más de lo
justo.
En estas razones y pláticas se les pasó todo aquel día, y aun otros cuatro,
sin sucederles cosa que estorbase su camino; y al quinto día, a la entrada
de un lugar, hallaron a la puerta de un mesón mucha gente, que, por ser
fiesta, se estaba allí solazando. Cuando llegaba a ellos don Quijote, un
labrador alzó la voz diciendo:
— Alguno destos dos señores que aquí vienen, que no conocen las partes, dirá
lo que se ha de hacer en nuestra apuesta.
— Sí diré, por cierto —respondió don Quijote—, con toda rectitud, si es que
alcanzo a entenderla.
— «Es, pues, el caso —dijo el labrador—, señor bueno, que un vecino deste
lugar, tan gordo que pesa once arrobas, desafió a correr a otro su vecino,
que no pesa más que cinco. Fue la condición que habían de correr una
carrera de cien pasos con pesos iguales; y, habiéndole preguntado al
desafiador cómo se había de igualar el peso, dijo que el desafiado, que
pesa cinco arrobas, se pusiese seis de hierro a cuestas, y así se
igualarían las once arrobas del flaco con las once del gordo.»
— Eso no —dijo a esta sazón Sancho, antes que don Quijote respondiese—. Y a
mí, que ha pocos días que salí de ser gobernador y juez, como todo el mundo
sabe, toca averiguar estas dudas y dar parecer en todo pleito.
— Responde en buen hora —dijo don Quijote—, Sancho amigo, que yo no estoy
para dar migas a un gato, según traigo alborotado y trastornado el juicio.
Con esta licencia, dijo Sancho a los labradores, que estaban muchos
alrededor dél la boca abierta, esperando la sentencia de la suya:
— Hermanos, lo que el gordo pide no lleva camino, ni tiene sombra de
justicia alguna; porque si es verdad lo que se dice, que el desafiado puede
escoger las armas, no es bien que éste las escoja tales que le impidan ni
estorben el salir vencedor; y así, es mi parecer que el gordo desafiador se
escamonde, monde, entresaque, pula y atilde, y saque seis arrobas de sus
carnes, de aquí o de allí de su cuerpo, como mejor le pareciere y
estuviere; y desta manera, quedando en cinco arrobas de peso, se igualará y
ajustará con las cinco de su contrario, y así podrán correr igualmente.
— ¡Voto a tal —dijo un labrador que escuchó la sentencia de Sancho— que este
señor ha hablado como un bendito y sentenciado como un canónigo! Pero a
buen seguro que no ha de querer quitarse el gordo una onza de sus carnes,
cuanto más seis arrobas.
— Lo mejor es que no corran —respondió otro—, porque el flaco no se muela
con el peso, ni el gordo se descarne; y échese la mitad de la apuesta en
vino, y llevemos estos señores a la taberna de lo caro, y sobre mí la capa
cuando llueva.
— Yo, señores —respondió don Quijote—, os lo agradezco, pero no puedo
detenerme un punto, porque pensamientos y sucesos tristes me hacen parecer
descortés y caminar más que de paso.
Y así, dando de las espuelas a Rocinante, pasó adelante, dejándolos
admirados de haber visto y notado así su estraña figura como la discreción
de su criado, que por tal juzgaron a Sancho. Y otro de los labradores dijo:
— Si el criado es tan discreto, ¡cuál debe de ser el amo! Yo apostaré que si
van a estudiar a Salamanca, que a un tris han de venir a ser alcaldes de
corte; que todo es burla, sino estudiar y más estudiar, y tener favor y
ventura; y cuando menos se piensa el hombre, se halla con una vara en la
mano o con una mitra en la cabeza.
Aquella noche la pasaron amo y mozo en mitad del campo, al cielo raso y
descubierto; y otro día, siguiendo su camino, vieron que hacia ellos venía
un hombre de a pie, con unas alforjas al cuello y una azcona o chuzo en la
mano, propio talle de correo de a pie; el cual, como llegó junto a don
Quijote, adelantó el paso, y medio corriendo llegó a él, y, abrazándole por
el muslo derecho, que no alcanzaba a más, le dijo, con muestras de mucha
alegría:
— ¡Oh mi señor don Quijote de la Mancha, y qué gran contento ha de llegar al
corazón de mi señor el duque cuando sepa que vuestra merced vuelve a su
castillo, que todavía se está en él con mi señora la duquesa!
— No os conozco, amigo —respondió don Quijote—, ni sé quién sois, si vos no
me lo decís.
— Yo, señor don Quijote —respondió el correo—, soy Tosilos, el lacayo del
duque mi señor, que no quise pelear con vuestra merced sobre el casamiento
de la hija de doña Rodríguez.
— ¡Válame Dios! —dijo don Quijote—. ¿Es posible que sois vos el que los
encantadores mis enemigos transformaron en ese lacayo que decís, por
defraudarme de la honra de aquella batalla?
— Calle, señor bueno —replicó el cartero—, que no hubo encanto alguno ni
mudanza de rostro ninguna: tan lacayo Tosilos entré en la estacada como
Tosilos lacayo salí della. Yo pensé casarme sin pelear, por haberme
parecido bien la moza, pero sucedióme al revés mi pensamiento, pues, así
como vuestra merced se partió de nuestro castillo, el duque mi señor me
hizo dar cien palos por haber contravenido a las ordenanzas que me tenía
dadas antes de entrar en la batalla, y todo ha parado en que la muchacha es
ya monja, y doña Rodríguez se ha vuelto a Castilla, y yo voy ahora a
Barcelona, a llevar un pliego de cartas al virrey, que le envía mi amo. Si
vuestra merced quiere un traguito, aunque caliente, puro, aquí llevo una
calabaza llena de lo caro, con no sé cuántas rajitas de queso de Tronchón,
que servirán de llamativo y despertador de la sed, si acaso está durmiendo.
— Quiero el envite —dijo Sancho—, y échese el resto de la cortesía, y
escancie el buen Tosilos, a despecho y pesar de cuantos encantadores hay en
las Indias.
— En fin —dijo don Quijote—, tú eres, Sancho, el mayor glotón del mundo y el
mayor ignorante de la tierra, pues no te persuades que este correo es
encantado, y este Tosilos contrahecho. Quédate con él y hártate, que yo me
iré adelante poco a poco, esperándote a que vengas.
Rióse el lacayo, desenvainó su calabaza, desalforjó sus rajas, y, sacando
un panecillo, él y Sancho se sentaron sobre la yerba verde, y en buena paz
compaña despabilaron y dieron fondo con todo el repuesto de las alforjas,
con tan buenos alientos, que lamieron el pliego de las cartas, sólo porque
olía a queso. Dijo Tosilos a Sancho:
— Sin duda este tu amo, Sancho amigo, debe de ser un loco.
— ¿Cómo debe? —respondió Sancho—. No debe nada a nadie, que todo lo paga, y
más cuando la moneda es locura. Bien lo veo yo, y bien se lo digo a él;
pero, ¿qué aprovecha? Y más agora que va rematado, porque va vencido del
Caballero de la Blanca Luna.
Rogóle Tosilos le contase lo que le había sucedido, pero Sancho le
respondió que era descortesía dejar que su amo le esperase; que otro día,
si se encontrasen, habría lugar par ello. Y, levantándose, después de
haberse sacudido el sayo y las migajas de las barbas, antecogió al rucio,
y, diciendo ''a Dios'', dejó a Tosilos y alcanzó a su amo, que a la sombra
de un árbol le estaba esperando.
Capítulo LXVII. De la resolución que tomó don Quijote de hacerse pastor y
seguir la vida del campo, en tanto que se pasaba el año de su promesa, con
otros sucesos en verdad gustosos y buenos
Si muchos pensamientos fatigaban a don Quijote antes de ser derribado,
muchos más le fatigaron después de caído. A la sombra del árbol estaba,
como se ha dicho, y allí, como moscas a la miel, le acudían y picaban
pensamientos: unos iban al desencanto de Dulcinea y otros a la vida que
había de hacer en su forzosa retirada. Llegó Sancho y alabóle la liberal
condición del lacayo Tosilos.
— ¿Es posible —le dijo don Quijote— que todavía, ¡oh Sancho!, pienses que
aquél sea verdadero lacayo? Parece que se te ha ido de las mientes haber
visto a Dulcinea convertida y transformada en labradora, y al Caballero de
los Espejos en el bachiller Carrasco, obras todas de los encantadores que
me persiguen. Pero dime agora: ¿preguntaste a ese Tosilos que dices qué ha
hecho Dios de Altisidora: si ha llorado mi ausencia, o si ha dejado ya en
las manos del olvido los enamorados pensamientos que en mi presencia la
fatigaban?
— No eran —respondió Sancho— los que yo tenía tales que me diesen lugar a
preguntar boberías. ¡Cuerpo de mí!, señor, ¿está vuestra merced ahora en
términos de inquirir pensamientos ajenos, especialmente amorosos?
— Mira, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, mucha diferencia hay de las obras que se
hacen por amor a las que se hacen por agradecimiento. Bien puede ser que un
caballero sea desamorado, pero no puede ser, hablando en todo rigor, que
sea desagradecido. Quísome bien, al parecer, Altisidora; diome los tres
tocadores que sabes, lloró en mi partida, maldíjome, vituperóme, quejóse, a
despecho de la vergüenza, públicamente: señales todas de que me adoraba,
que las iras de los amantes suelen parar en maldiciones. Yo no tuve
esperanzas que darle, ni tesoros que ofrecerle, porque las mías las tengo
entregadas a Dulcinea, y los tesoros de los caballeros andantes son, como
los de los duendes, aparentes y falsos, y sólo puedo darle estos acuerdos
que della tengo, sin perjuicio, pero, de los que tengo de Dulcinea, a quien
tú agravias con la remisión que tienes en azotarte y en castigar esas
carnes, que vea yo comidas de lobos, que quieren guardarse antes para los
gusanos que para el remedio de aquella pobre señora.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, si va a decir la verdad, yo no me puedo
persuadir que los azotes de mis posaderas tengan que ver con los
desencantos de los encantados, que es como si dijésemos: "Si os duele la
cabeza, untaos las rodillas". A lo menos, yo osaré jurar que en cuantas
historias vuesa merced ha leído que tratan de la andante caballería no ha
visto algún desencantado por azotes; pero, por sí o por no, yo me los daré,
cuando tenga gana y el tiempo me dé comodidad para castigarme.
— Dios lo haga —respondió don Quijote—, y los cielos te den gracia para que
caigas en la cuenta y en la obligación que te corre de ayudar a mi señora,
que lo es tuya, pues tú eres mío.
En estas pláticas iban siguiendo su camino, cuando llegaron al mesmo sitio
y lugar donde fueron atropellados de los toros. Reconocióle don Quijote;
dijo a Sancho:
— Éste es el prado donde topamos a las bizarras pastoras y gallardos
pastores que en él querían renovar e imitar a la pastoral Arcadia,
pensamiento tan nuevo como discreto, a cuya imitación, si es que a ti te
parece bien, querría, ¡oh Sancho!, que nos convirtiésemos en pastores,
siquiera el tiempo que tengo de estar recogido. Yo compraré algunas ovejas,
y todas las demás cosas que al pastoral ejercicio son necesarias, y
llamándome yo el pastor Quijotiz, y tú el pastor Pancino, nos andaremos por
los montes, por las selvas y por los prados, cantando aquí, endechando
allí, bebiendo de los líquidos cristales de las fuentes, o ya de los
limpios arroyuelos, o de los caudalosos ríos. Daránnos con abundantísima
mano de su dulcísimo fruto las encinas, asiento los troncos de los
durísimos alcornoques, sombra los sauces, olor las rosas, alfombras de mil
colores matizadas los estendidos prados, aliento el aire claro y puro, luz
la luna y las estrellas, a pesar de la escuridad de la noche, gusto el
canto, alegría el lloro, Apolo versos, el amor conceptos, con que podremos
hacernos eternos y famosos, no sólo en los presentes, sino en los venideros
siglos.
— Pardiez —dijo Sancho—, que me ha cuadrado, y aun esquinado, tal género de
vida; y más, que no la ha de haber aún bien visto el bachiller Sansón
Carrasco y maese Nicolás el barbero, cuando la han de querer seguir, y
hacerse pastores con nosotros; y aun quiera Dios no le venga en voluntad al
cura de entrar también en el aprisco, según es de alegre y amigo de
holgarse.
— Tú has dicho muy bien —dijo don Quijote—; y podrá llamarse el bachiller
Sansón Carrasco, si entra en el pastoral gremio, como entrará sin duda, el
pastor Sansonino, o ya el pastor Carrascón; el barbero Nicolás se podrá
llamar Miculoso, como ya el antiguo Boscán se llamó Nemoroso; al cura no sé
qué nombre le pongamos, si no es algún derivativo de su nombre, llamándole
el pastor Curiambro. Las pastoras de quien hemos de ser amantes, como entre
peras podremos escoger sus nombres; y, pues el de mi señora cuadra así al
de pastora como al de princesa, no hay para qué cansarme en buscar otro que
mejor le venga; tú, Sancho, pondrás a la tuya el que quisieres.
— No pienso —respondió Sancho— ponerle otro alguno sino el de Teresona, que
le vendrá bien con su gordura y con el propio que tiene, pues se llama
Teresa; y más, que, celebrándola yo en mis versos, vengo a descubrir mis
castos deseos, pues no ando a buscar pan de trastrigo por las casas ajenas.
El cura no será bien que tenga pastora, por dar buen ejemplo; y si quisiere
el bachiller tenerla, su alma en su palma.
— ¡Válame Dios —dijo don Quijote—, y qué vida nos hemos de dar, Sancho
amigo! ¡Qué de churumbelas han de llegar a nuestros oídos, qué de gaitas
zamoranas, qué tamborines, y qué de sonajas, y qué de rabeles! Pues, ¡qué
si destas diferencias de músicas resuena la de los albogues! Allí se verá
casi todos los instrumentos pastorales.
— ¿Qué son albogues —preguntó Sancho—, que ni los he oído nombrar, ni los he
visto en toda mi vida?
— Albogues son —respondió don Quijote— unas chapas a modo de candeleros de
azófar, que, dando una con otra por lo vacío y hueco, hace un son, si no
muy agradable ni armónico, no descontenta, y viene bien con la rusticidad
de la gaita y del tamborín; y este nombre albogues es morisco, como lo son
todos aquellos que en nuestra lengua castellana comienzan en al, conviene a
saber: almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema, almacén, alcancía,
y otros semejantes, que deben ser pocos más; y solos tres tiene nuestra
lengua que son moriscos y acaban en i, y son: borceguí, zaquizamí y
maravedí. Alhelí y alfaquí, tanto por el al primero como por el i en que
acaban, son conocidos por arábigos. Esto te he dicho, de paso, por
habérmelo reducido a la memoria la ocasión de haber nombrado albogues; y
hanos de ayudar mucho al parecer en perfeción este ejercicio el ser yo
algún tanto poeta, como tú sabes, y el serlo también en estremo el
bachiller Sansón Carrasco. Del cura no digo nada; pero yo apostaré que debe
de tener sus puntas y collares de poeta; y que las tenga también maese
Nicolás, no dudo en ello, porque todos, o los más, son guitarristas y
copleros. Yo me quejaré de ausencia; tú te alabarás de firme enamorado; el
pastor Carrascón, de desdeñado; y el cura Curiambro, de lo que él más puede
servirse, y así, andará la cosa que no haya más que desear.
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— Yo soy, señor, tan desgraciado que temo no ha de llegar el día en que en
tal ejercicio me vea. ¡Oh, qué polidas cuchares tengo de hacer cuando
pastor me vea! ¡Qué de migas, qué de natas, qué de guirnaldas y qué de
zarandajas pastoriles, que, puesto que no me granjeen fama de discreto, no
dejarán de granjearme la de ingenioso! Sanchica mi hija nos llevará la
comida al hato. Pero, ¡guarda!, que es de buen parecer, y hay pastores más
maliciosos que simples, y no querría que fuese por lana y volviese
trasquilada; y también suelen andar los amores y los no buenos deseos por
los campos como por las ciudades, y por las pastorales chozas como por los
reales palacios, y, quitada la causa se quita el pecado; y ojos que no
veen, corazón que no quiebra; y más vale salto de mata que ruego de hombres
buenos.
— No más refranes, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, pues cualquiera de los que has
dicho basta para dar a entender tu pensamiento; y muchas veces te he
aconsejado que no seas tan pródigo en refranes y que te vayas a la mano en
decirlos; pero paréceme que es predicar en desierto, y "castígame mi madre,
y yo trómpogelas".
— Paréceme —respondió Sancho— que vuesa merced es como lo que dicen: "Dijo
la sartén a la caldera: Quítate allá ojinegra". Estáme reprehendiendo que
no diga yo refranes, y ensártalos vuesa merced de dos en dos.
— Mira, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—: yo traigo los refranes a propósito,
y vienen cuando los digo como anillo en el dedo; pero tráeslos tan por los
cabellos, que los arrastras, y no los guías; y si no me acuerdo mal, otra
vez te he dicho que los refranes son sentencias breves, sacadas de la
experiencia y especulación de nuestros antiguos sabios; y el refrán que no
viene a propósito, antes es disparate que sentencia. Pero dejémonos desto,
y, pues ya viene la noche, retirémonos del camino real algún trecho, donde
pasaremos esta noche, y Dios sabe lo que será mañana.
Retiráronse, cenaron tarde y mal, bien contra la voluntad de Sancho, a
quien se le representaban las estrechezas de la andante caballería usadas
en las selvas y en los montes, si bien tal vez la abundancia se mostraba en
los castillos y casas, así de don Diego de Miranda como en las bodas del
rico Camacho, y de don Antonio Moreno; pero consideraba no ser posible ser
siempre de día ni siempre de noche, y así, pasó aquélla durmiendo, y su amo
velando.
Capítulo LXVIII. De la cerdosa aventura que le aconteció a don Quijote
Era la noche algo escura, puesto que la luna estaba en el cielo, pero no en
parte que pudiese ser vista: que tal vez la señora Diana se va a pasear a
los antípodas, y deja los montes negros y los valles escuros. Cumplió don
Quijote con la naturaleza durmiendo el primer sueño, sin dar lugar al
segundo; bien al revés de Sancho, que nunca tuvo segundo, porque le duraba
el sueño desde la noche hasta la mañana, en que se mostraba su buena
complexión y pocos cuidados. Los de don Quijote le desvelaron de manera que
despertó a Sancho y le dijo:
— Maravillado estoy, Sancho, de la libertad de tu condición: yo imagino que
eres hecho de mármol, o de duro bronce, en quien no cabe movimiento ni
sentimiento alguno. Yo velo cuando tú duermes, yo lloro cuando cantas, yo
me desmayo de ayuno cuanto tú estás perezoso y desalentado de puro harto.
De buenos criados es conllevar las penas de sus señores y sentir sus
sentimientos, por el bien parecer siquiera. Mira la serenidad desta noche,
la soledad en que estamos, que nos convida a entremeter alguna vigilia
entre nuestro sueño. Levántate, por tu vida, y desvíate algún trecho de
aquí, y con buen ánimo y denuedo agradecido date trecientos o cuatrocientos
azotes a buena cuenta de los del desencanto de Dulcinea; y esto rogando te
lo suplico, que no quiero venir contigo a los brazos, como la otra vez,
porque sé que los tienes pesados. Después que te hayas dado, pasaremos lo
que resta de la noche cantando, yo mi ausencia y tú tu firmeza, dando desde
agora principio al ejercicio pastoral que hemos de tener en nuestra aldea.
— Señor —respondió Sancho—, no soy yo religioso para que desde la mitad de
mi sueño me levante y me dicipline, ni menos me parece que del estremo del
dolor de los azotes se pueda pasar al de la música. Vuesa merced me deje
dormir y no me apriete en lo del azotarme; que me hará hacer juramento de
no tocarme jamás al pelo del sayo, no que al de mis carnes.
— ¡Oh alma endurecida! ¡Oh escudero sin piedad! ¡Oh pan mal empleado y
mercedes mal consideradas las que te he hecho y pienso de hacerte! Por mí
te has visto gobernador, y por mí te vees con esperanzas propincuas de ser
conde, o tener otro título equivalente, y no tardará el cumplimiento de
ellas más de cuanto tarde en pasar este año; que yo post tenebras spero
lucem.
— No entiendo eso —replico Sancho—; sólo entiendo que, en tanto que duermo,
ni tengo temor, ni esperanza, ni trabajo ni gloria; y bien haya el que
inventó el sueño, capa que cubre todos los humanos pensamientos, manjar que
quita la hambre, agua que ahuyenta la sed, fuego que calienta el frío, frío
que templa el ardor, y, finalmente, moneda general con que todas las cosas
se compran, balanza y peso que iguala al pastor con el rey y al simple con
el discreto. Sola una cosa tiene mala el sueño, según he oído decir, y es
que se parece a la muerte, pues de un dormido a un muerto hay muy poca
diferencia.
— Nunca te he oído hablar, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, tan elegantemente como
ahora, por donde vengo a conocer ser verdad el refrán que tú algunas veces
sueles decir: "No con quien naces, sino con quien paces".
— ¡Ah, pesia tal —replicó Sancho—, señor nuestro amo! No soy yo ahora el que
ensarta refranes, que también a vuestra merced se le caen de la boca de dos
en dos mejor que a mí, sino que debe de haber entre los míos y los suyos
esta diferencia: que los de vuestra merced vendrán a tiempo y los míos a
deshora; pero, en efecto, todos son refranes.
En esto estaban, cuando sintieron un sordo estruendo y un áspero ruido, que
por todos aquellos valles se estendía. Levantóse en pie don Quijote y puso
mano a la espada, y Sancho se agazapó debajo del rucio, poniéndose a los
lados el lío de las armas, y la albarda de su jumento, tan temblando de
miedo como alborotado don Quijote. De punto en punto iba creciendo el
ruido, y, llegándose cerca a los dos temerosos; a lo menos, al uno, que al
otro, ya se sabe su valentía.
Es, pues, el caso que llevaban unos hombres a vender a una feria más de
seiscientos puercos, con los cuales caminaban a aquellas horas, y era tanto
el ruido que llevaban y el gruñir y el bufar, que ensordecieron los oídos
de don Quijote y de Sancho, que no advirtieron lo que ser podía. Llegó de
tropel la estendida y gruñidora piara, y, sin tener respeto a la autoridad
de don Quijote, ni a la de Sancho, pasaron por cima de los dos, deshaciendo
las trincheas de Sancho, y derribando no sólo a don Quijote, sino llevando
por añadidura a Rocinante. El tropel, el gruñir, la presteza con que
llegaron los animales inmundos, puso en confusión y por el suelo a la
albarda, a las armas, al rucio, a Rocinante, a Sancho y a don Quijote.
Levantóse Sancho como mejor pudo, y pidió a su amo la espada, diciéndole
que quería matar media docena de aquellos señores y descomedidos puercos,
que ya había conocido que lo eran. Don Quijote le dijo:
— Déjalos estar, amigo, que esta afrenta es pena de mi pecado, y justo
castigo del cielo es que a un caballero andante vencido le coman adivas, y
le piquen avispas y le hollen puercos.
— También debe de ser castigo del cielo —respondió Sancho— que a los
escuderos de los caballeros vencidos los puncen moscas, los coman piojos y
les embista la hambre. Si los escuderos fuéramos hijos de los caballeros a
quien servimos, o parientes suyos muy cercanos, no fuera mucho que nos
alcanzara la pena de sus culpas hasta la cuarta generación; pero, ¿qué
tienen que ver los Panzas con los Quijotes? Ahora bien: tornémonos a
acomodar y durmamos lo poco que queda de la noche, y amanecerá Dios y
medraremos.
— Duerme tú, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que naciste para dormir; que
yo, que nací para velar, en el tiempo que falta de aquí al día, daré rienda
a mis pensamientos, y los desfogaré en un madrigalete, que, sin que tú lo
sepas, anoche compuse en la memoria.
— A mí me parece —respondió Sancho— que los pensamientos que dan lugar a
hacer coplas no deben de ser muchos. Vuesa merced coplee cuanto quisiere,
que yo dormiré cuanto pudiere.
Y luego, tomando en el suelo cuanto quiso, se acurrucó y durmió a sueño
suelto, sin que fianzas, ni deudas, ni dolor alguno se lo estorbase. Don
Quijote, arrimado a un tronco de una haya o de un alcornoque —que Cide
Hamete Benengeli no distingue el árbol que era—, al son de sus mesmos
suspiros, cantó de esta suerte:
-Amor, cuando yo pienso
en el mal que me das, terrible y fuerte,
voy corriendo a la muerte,
pensando así acabar mi mal inmenso;
mas, en llegando al paso
que es puerto en este mar de mi tormento,
tanta alegría siento,
que la vida se esfuerza y no le paso.
Así el vivir me mata,
que la muerte me torna a dar la vida.
¡Oh condición no oída,
la que conmigo muerte y vida trata!
Cada verso déstos acompañaba con muchos suspiros y no pocas lágrimas, bien
como aquél cuyo corazón tenía traspasado con el dolor del vencimiento y con
la ausencia de Dulcinea.
Llegóse en esto el día, dio el sol con sus rayos en los ojos a Sancho,
despertó y esperezóse, sacudiéndose y estirándose los perezosos miembros;
miró el destrozo que habían hecho los puercos en su repostería, y maldijo
la piara y aun más adelante. Finalmente, volvieron los dos a su comenzado
camino, y al declinar de la tarde vieron que hacia ellos venían hasta diez
hombres de a caballo y cuatro o cinco de a pie. Sobresaltóse el corazón
de don Quijote y azoróse el de Sancho, porque la gente que se les llegaba
traía lanzas y adargas y venía muy a punto de guerra. Volvióse don Quijote
a Sancho, y díjole:
— Si yo pudiera, Sancho, ejercitar mis armas, y mi promesa no me hubiera
atado los brazos, esta máquina que sobre nosotros viene la tuviera yo por
tortas y pan pintado, pero podría ser fuese otra cosa de la que tememos.
Llegaron, en esto, los de a caballo, y arbolando las lanzas, sin hablar
palabra alguna rodearon a don Quijote y se las pusieron a las espaldas y
pechos, amenazándole de muerte. Uno de los de a pie, puesto un dedo en la
boca, en señal de que callase, asió del freno de Rocinante y le sacó del
camino; y los demás de a pie, antecogiendo a Sancho y al rucio, guardando
todos maravilloso silencio, siguieron los pasos del que llevaba a don
Quijote, el cual dos o tres veces quiso preguntar adónde le llevaban o qué
querían; pero, apenas comenzaba a mover los labios, cuando se los iban a
cerrar con los hierros de las lanzas; y a Sancho le acontecía lo mismo,
porque, apenas daba muestras de hablar, cuando uno de los de a pie, con un
aguijón, le punzaba, y al rucio ni más ni menos como si hablar quisiera.
Cerró la noche, apresuraron el paso, creció en los dos presos el miedo, y
más cuando oyeron que de cuando en cuando les decían:
— ¡Caminad, trogloditas!
— ¡Callad, bárbaros!
— ¡Pagad, antropófagos!
— ¡No os quejéis, scitas, ni abráis los ojos, Polifemos matadores, leones
carniceros!
Y otros nombres semejantes a éstos, con que atormentaban los oídos de los
miserables amo y mozo. Sancho iba diciendo entre sí:
— ¿Nosotros tortolitas? ¿Nosotros barberos ni estropajos? ¿Nosotros
perritas, a quien dicen cita, cita? No me contentan nada estos nombres: a
mal viento va esta parva; todo el mal nos viene junto, como al perro los
palos, y ¡ojalá parase en ellos lo que amenaza esta aventura tan
desventurada!
Iba don Quijote embelesado, sin poder atinar con cuantos discursos hacía
qué serían aquellos nombres llenos de vituperios que les ponían, de los
cuales sacaba en limpio no esperar ningún bien y temer mucho mal. Llegaron,
en esto, un hora casi de la noche, a un castillo, que bien conoció don
Quijote que era el del duque, donde había poco que habían estado.
— ¡Váleme Dios! —dijo, así como conoció la estancia— y ¿qué será esto? Sí
que en esta casa todo es cortesía y buen comedimiento, pero para los
vencidos el bien se vuelve en mal y el mal en peor.
Entraron al patio principal del castillo, y viéronle aderezado y puesto de
manera que les acrecentó la admiración y les dobló el miedo, como se verá
en el siguiente capítulo.
Capítulo LXIX. Del más raro y más nuevo suceso que en todo el discurso
desta grande historia avino a don Quijote
Apeáronse los de a caballo, y, junto con los de a pie, tomando en peso y
arrebatadamente a Sancho y a don Quijote, los entraron en el patio,
alrededor del cual ardían casi cien hachas, puestas en sus blandones, y,
por los corredores del patio, más de quinientas luminarias; de modo que, a
pesar de la noche, que se mostraba algo escura, no se echaba de ver la
falta del día. En medio del patio se levantaba un túmulo como dos varas del
suelo, cubierto todo con un grandísimo dosel de terciopelo negro, alrededor
del cual, por sus gradas, ardían velas de cera blanca sobre más de cien
candeleros de plata; encima del cual túmulo se mostraba un cuerpo muerto de
una tan hermosa doncella, que hacía parecer con su hermosura hermosa a la
misma muerte. Tenía la cabeza sobre una almohada de brocado, coronada con
una guirnalda de diversas y odoríferas flores tejida, las manos cruzadas
sobre el pecho, y, entre ellas, un ramo de amarilla y vencedora palma.
A un lado del patio estaba puesto un teatro, y en dos sillas sentados dos
personajes, que, por tener coronas en la cabeza y ceptros en las manos,
daban señales de ser algunos reyes, ya verdaderos o ya fingidos. Al lado
deste teatro, adonde se subía por algunas gradas, estaban otras dos sillas,
sobre las cuales los que trujeron los presos sentaron a don Quijote y a
Sancho, todo esto callando y dándoles a entender con señales a los dos que
asimismo callasen; pero, sin que se lo señalaran, callaron ellos, porque la
admiración de lo que estaban mirando les tenía atadas las lenguas.
Subieron, en esto, al teatro, con mucho acompañamiento, dos principales
personajes, que luego fueron conocidos de don Quijote ser el duque y la
duquesa, sus huéspedes, los cuales se sentaron en dos riquísimas sillas,
junto a los dos que parecían reyes. ¿Quién no se había de admirar con esto,
añadiéndose a ello haber conocido don Quijote que el cuerpo muerto que
estaba sobre el túmulo era el de la hermosa Altisidora?
Al subir el duque y la duquesa en el teatro, se levantaron don Quijote y
Sancho y les hicieron una profunda humillación, y los duques hicieron lo
mesmo, inclinando algún tanto las cabezas.
Salió, en esto, de través un ministro, y, llegándose a Sancho, le echó una
ropa de bocací negro encima, toda pintada con llamas de fuego, y,
quitándole la caperuza, le puso en la cabeza una coroza, al modo de las que
sacan los penitenciados por el Santo Oficio; y díjole al oído que no
descosiese los labios, porque le echarían una mordaza, o le quitarían la
vida. Mirábase Sancho de arriba abajo, veíase ardiendo en llamas, pero como
no le quemaban, no las estimaba en dos ardites. Quitóse la coroza, viola
pintada de diablos, volviósela a poner, diciendo entre sí:
— Aún bien, que ni ellas me abrasan ni ellos me llevan.
Mirábale también don Quijote, y, aunque el temor le tenía suspensos los
sentidos, no dejó de reírse de ver la figura de Sancho. Comenzó, en esto, a
salir, al parecer, debajo del túmulo un son sumiso y agradable de flautas,
que, por no ser impedido de alguna humana voz, porque en aquel sitio el
mesmo silencio guardaba silencio a sí mismo, se mostraba blando y amoroso.
Luego hizo de sí improvisa muestra, junto a la almohada del, al parecer,
cadáver, un hermoso mancebo vestido a lo romano, que, al son de una arpa,
que él mismo tocaba, cantó con suavísima y clara voz estas dos estancias:
-En tanto que en sí vuelve Altisidora,
muerta por la crueldad de don Quijote,
y en tanto que en la corte encantadora
se vistieren las damas de picote,
y en tanto que a sus dueñas mi señora
vistiere de bayeta y de anascote,
cantaré su belleza y su desgracia,
con mejor plectro que el cantor de Tracia.
Y aun no se me figura que me toca
aqueste oficio solamente en vida;
mas, con la lengua muerta y fría en la boca,
pienso mover la voz a ti debida.
Libre mi alma de su estrecha roca,
por el estigio lago conducida,
celebrándote irá, y aquel sonido
hará parar las aguas del olvido.
— No más —dijo a esta sazón uno de los dos que parecían reyes—: no más,
cantor divino; que sería proceder en infinito representarnos ahora la
muerte y las gracias de la sin par Altisidora, no muerta, como el mundo
ignorante piensa, sino viva en las lenguas de la Fama, y en la pena que
para volverla a la perdida luz ha de pasar Sancho Panza, que está presente;
y así, ¡oh tú, Radamanto, que conmigo juzgas en las cavernas lóbregas de
Lite!, pues sabes todo aquello que en los inescrutables hados está
determinado acerca de volver en sí esta doncella, dilo y decláralo luego,
porque no se nos dilate el bien que con su nueva vuelta esperamos.
Apenas hubo dicho esto Minos, juez y compañero de Radamanto, cuando,
levantándose en pie Radamanto, dijo:
— ¡Ea, ministros de esta casa, altos y bajos, grandes y chicos, acudid unos
tras otros y sellad el rostro de Sancho con veinte y cuatro mamonas, y doce
pellizcos y seis alfilerazos en brazos y lomos, que en esta ceremonia
consiste la salud de Altisidora!
Oyendo lo cual Sancho Panza, rompió el silencio, y dijo:
— ¡Voto a tal, así me deje yo sellar el rostro ni manosearme la cara como
volverme moro! ¡Cuerpo de mí! ¿Qué tiene que ver manosearme el rostro con
la resurreción desta doncella? Regostóse la vieja a los bledos. Encantan a
Dulcinea, y azótanme para que se desencante; muérese Altisidora de males
que Dios quiso darle, y hanla de resucitar hacerme a mí veinte y cuatro
mamonas, y acribarme el cuerpo a alfilerazos y acardenalarme los brazos a
pellizcos. ¡Esas burlas, a un cuñado, que yo soy perro viejo, y no hay
conmigo tus, tus!
— ¡Morirás! —dijo en alta voz Radamanto—. Ablándate, tigre; humíllate,
Nembrot soberbio, y sufre y calla, pues no te piden imposibles. Y no te
metas en averiguar las dificultades deste negocio: mamonado has de ser,
acrebillado te has de ver, pellizcado has de gemir. ¡Ea, digo, ministros,
cumplid mi mandamiento; si no, por la fe de hombre de bien, que habéis de
ver para lo que nacistes!
Parecieron, en esto, que por el patio venían, hasta seis dueñas en
procesión, una tras otra, las cuatro con antojos, y todas levantadas las
manos derechas en alto, con cuatro dedos de muñecas de fuera, para hacer
las manos más largas, como ahora se usa. No las hubo visto Sancho, cuando,
bramando como un toro, dijo:
— Bien podré yo dejarme manosear de todo el mundo, pero consentir que me
toquen dueñas, ¡eso no! Gatéenme el rostro, como hicieron a mi amo en este
mesmo castillo; traspásenme el cuerpo con puntas de dagas buidas;
atenácenme los brazos con tenazas de fuego, que yo lo llevaré en paciencia,
o serviré a estos señores; pero que me toquen dueñas no lo consentiré, si
me llevase el diablo.
Rompió también el silencio don Quijote, diciendo a Sancho:
— Ten paciencia, hijo, y da gusto a estos señores, y muchas gracias al cielo
por haber puesto tal virtud en tu persona, que con el martirio della
desencantes los encantados y resucites los muertos.
Ya estaban las dueñas cerca de Sancho, cuando él, más blando y más
persuadido, poniéndose bien en la silla, dio rostro y barba a la primera,
la cual la hizo una mamona muy bien sellada, y luego una gran reverencia.
— ¡Menos cortesía; menos mudas, señora dueña —dijo Sancho—; que por Dios que
traéis las manos oliendo a vinagrillo!
Finalmente, todas las dueñas le sellaron, y otra mucha gente de casa le
pellizcaron; pero lo que él no pudo sufrir fue el punzamiento de los
alfileres; y así, se levantó de la silla, al parecer mohíno, y, asiendo de
una hacha encendida que junto a él estaba, dio tras las dueñas, y tras
todos su verdugos, diciendo:
— ¡Afuera, ministros infernales, que no soy yo de bronce, para no sentir tan
extraordinarios martirios!
En esto, Altisidora, que debía de estar cansada por haber estado tanto
tiempo supina, se volvió de un lado; visto lo cual por los circunstantes,
casi todos a una voz dijeron:
— ¡Viva es Altisidora! ¡Altisidora vive!
Mandó Radamanto a Sancho que depusiese la ira, pues ya se había alcanzado
el intento que se procuraba.
Así como don Quijote vio rebullir a Altisidora, se fue a poner de rodillas
delante de Sancho, diciéndole:
— Agora es tiempo, hijo de mis entrañas, no que escudero mío, que te des
algunos de los azotes que estás obligado a dar por el desencanto de
Dulcinea. Ahora, digo, que es el tiempo donde tienes sazonada la virtud, y
con eficacia de obrar el bien que de ti se espera.
A lo que respondió Sancho:
— Esto me parece argado sobre argado, y no miel sobre hojuelas. Bueno sería
que tras pellizcos, mamonas y alfilerazos viniesen ahora los azotes. No
tienen más que hacer sino tomar una gran piedra, y atármela al cuello, y
dar conmigo en un pozo, de lo que a mí no pesaría mucho, si es que para
curar los males ajenos tengo yo de ser la vaca de la boda. Déjenme; si no,
por Dios que lo arroje y lo eche todo a trece, aunque no se venda.
Ya en esto, se había sentado en el túmulo Altisidora, y al mismo instante
sonaron las chirimías, a quien acompañaron las flautas y las voces de
todos, que aclamaban:
— ¡Viva Altisidora! ¡Altisidora viva!
Levantáronse los duques y los reyes Minos y Radamanto, y todos juntos, con
don Quijote y Sancho, fueron a recebir a Altisidora y a bajarla del túmulo;
la cual, haciendo de la desmayada, se inclinó a los duques y a los reyes,
y, mirando de través a don Quijote, le dijo:
— Dios te lo perdone, desamorado caballero, pues por tu crueldad he estado
en el otro mundo, a mi parecer, más de mil años; y a ti, ¡oh el más
compasivo escudero que contiene el orbe!, te agradezco la vida que poseo.
Dispón desde hoy más, amigo Sancho, de seis camisas mías que te mando para
que hagas otras seis para ti; y, si no son todas sanas, a lo menos son
todas limpias.
Besóle por ello las manos Sancho, con la coroza en la mano y las rodillas
en el suelo. Mandó el duque que se la quitasen, y le volviesen su caperuza,
y le pusiesen el sayo, y le quitasen la ropa de las llamas. Suplicó Sancho
al duque que le dejasen la ropa y mitra, que las quería llevar a su tierra,
por señal y memoria de aquel nunca visto suceso. La duquesa respondió que
sí dejarían, que ya sabía él cuán grande amiga suya era. Mandó el duque
despejar el patio, y que todos se recogiesen a sus estancias, y que a don
Quijote y a Sancho los llevasen a las que ellos ya se sabían.
Capítulo LXX. Que sigue al de sesenta y nueve, y trata de cosas no
escusadas para la claridad desta historia
Durmió Sancho aquella noche en una carriola, en el mesmo aposento de don
Quijote, cosa que él quisiera escusarla, si pudiera, porque bien sabía que
su amo no le había de dejar dormir a preguntas y a respuestas, y no se
hallaba en disposición de hablar mucho, porque los dolores de los martirios
pasados los tenía presentes, y no le dejaban libre la lengua, y viniérale
más a cuento dormir en una choza solo, que no en aquella rica estancia
acompañado. Salióle su temor tan verdadero y su sospecha tan cierta, que,
apenas hubo entrado su señor en el lecho, cuando dijo:
— ¿Qué te parece, Sancho, del suceso desta noche? Grande y poderosa es la
fuerza del desdén desamorado, como por tus mismos ojos has visto muerta a
Altisidora, no con otras saetas, ni con otra espada, ni con otro
instrumento bélico, ni con venenos mortíferos, sino con la consideración
del rigor y el desdén con que yo siempre la he tratado.
— Muriérase ella en hora buena cuanto quisiera y como quisiera —respondió
Sancho—, y dejárame a mí en mi casa, pues ni yo la enamoré ni la desdeñé en
mi vida. Yo no sé ni puedo pensar cómo sea que la salud de Altisidora,
doncella más antojadiza que discreta, tenga que ver, como otra vez he
dicho, con los martirios de Sancho Panza. Agora sí que vengo a conocer
clara y distintamente que hay encantadores y encantos en el mundo, de quien
Dios me libre, pues yo no me sé librar; con todo esto, suplico a vuestra
merced me deje dormir y no me pregunte más, si no quiere que me arroje por
una ventana abajo.
— Duerme, Sancho amigo —respondió don Quijote—, si es que te dan lugar los
alfilerazos y pellizcos recebidos, y las mamonas hechas.
— Ningún dolor —replicó Sancho— llegó a la afrenta de las mamonas, no por
otra cosa que por habérmelas hecho dueña, que confundidas sean; y torno a
suplicar a vuesa merced me deje dormir, porque el sueño es alivio de las
miserias de los que las tienen despiertas.
Sea así —dijo don Quijote—, y Dios te acompañe.
Durmiéronse los dos, y en este tiempo quiso escribir y dar cuenta Cide
Hamete, autor desta grande historia, qué les movió a los duques a levantar
el edificio de la máquina referida. Y dice que, no habiéndosele olvidado al
bachiller Sansón Carrasco cuando el Caballero de los Espejos fue vencido y
derribado por don Quijote, cuyo vencimiento y caída borró y deshizo todos
sus designios, quiso volver a probar la mano, esperando mejor suceso que el
pasado; y así, informándose del paje que llevó la carta y presente a Teresa
Panza, mujer de Sancho, adónde don Quijote quedaba, buscó nuevas armas y
caballo, y puso en el escudo la blanca luna, llevándolo todo sobre un
macho, a quien guiaba un labrador, y no Tomé Cecial, su antiguo escudero,
porque no fuese conocido de Sancho ni de don Quijote.
Llegó, pues, al castillo del duque, que le informó el camino y derrota que
don Quijote llevaba, con intento de hallarse en las justas de Zaragoza.
Díjole asimismo las burlas que le había hecho con la traza del desencanto
de Dulcinea, que había de ser a costa de las posaderas de Sancho. En fin,
dio cuenta de la burla que Sancho había hecho a su amo, dándole a entender
que Dulcinea estaba encantada y transformada en labradora, y cómo la
duquesa su mujer había dado a entender a Sancho que él era el que se
engañaba, porque verdaderamente estaba encantada Dulcinea; de que no poco
se rió y admiró el bachiller, considerando la agudeza y simplicidad de
Sancho, como del estremo de la locura de don Quijote.
Pidióle el duque que si le hallase, y le venciese o no, se volviese por
allí a darle cuenta del suceso. Hízolo así el bachiller; partióse en su
busca, no le halló en Zaragoza, pasó adelante y sucedióle lo que queda
referido.
Volvióse por el castillo del duque y contóselo todo, con las condiciones de
la batalla, y que ya don Quijote volvía a cumplir, como buen caballero
andante, la palabra de retirarse un año en su aldea, en el cual tiempo
podía ser, dijo el bachiller, que sanase de su locura; que ésta era la
intención que le había movido a hacer aquellas transformaciones, por ser
cosa de lástima que un hidalgo tan bien entendido como don Quijote fuese
loco. Con esto, se despidió del duque, y se volvió a su lugar, esperando en
él a don Quijote, que tras él venía.
De aquí tomó ocasión el duque de hacerle aquella burla: tanto era lo que
gustaba de las cosas de Sancho y de don Quijote; y haciendo tomar los
caminos cerca y lejos del castillo por todas las partes que imaginó que
podría volver don Quijote, con muchos criados suyos de a pie y de a
caballo, para que por fuerza o de grado le trujesen al castillo, si le
hallasen. Halláronle, dieron aviso al duque, el cual, ya prevenido de todo
lo que había de hacer, así como tuvo noticia de su llegada, mandó encender
las hachas y las luminarias del patio y poner a Altisidora sobre el túmulo,
con todos los aparatos que se han contado, tan al vivo, y tan bien hechos,
que de la verdad a ellos había bien poca diferencia.
Y dice más Cide Hamete: que tiene para sí ser tan locos los burladores como
los burlados, y que no estaban los duques dos dedos de parecer tontos, pues
tanto ahínco ponían en burlarse de dos tontos.
Los cuales, el uno durmiendo a sueño suelto, y el otro velando a
pensamientos desatados, les tomó el día y la gana de levantarse; que las
ociosas plumas, ni vencido ni vencedor, jamás dieron gusto a don Quijote.
Altisidora —en la opinión de don Quijote, vuelta de muerte a vida—,
siguiendo el humor de sus señores, coronada con la misma guirnalda que en
el túmulo tenía, y vestida una tunicela de tafetán blanco, sembrada de
flores de oro, y sueltos los cabellos por las espaldas, arrimada a un
báculo de negro y finísimo ébano, entró en el aposento de don Quijote, con
cuya presencia turbado y confuso, se encogió y cubrió casi todo con las
sábanas y colchas de la cama, muda la lengua, sin que acertase a hacerle
cortesía ninguna. Sentóse Altisidora en una silla, junto a su cabecera, y,
después de haber dado un gran suspiro, con voz tierna y debilitada le dijo:
— Cuando las mujeres principales y las recatadas doncellas atropellan por la
honra, y dan licencia a la lengua que rompa por todo inconveniente, dando
noticia en público de los secretos que su corazón encierra, en estrecho
término se hallan. Yo, señor don Quijote de la Mancha, soy una déstas,
apretada, vencida y enamorada; pero, con todo esto, sufrida y honesta;
tanto que, por serlo tanto, reventó mi alma por mi silencio y perdí la
vida. Dos días ha que con la consideración del rigor con que me has
tratado,
¡Oh más duro que mármol a mis quejas,
empedernido caballero!, he estado muerta, o, a lo menos, juzgada por tal de
los que me han visto; y si no fuera porque el Amor, condoliéndose de mí,
depositó mi remedio en los martirios deste buen escudero, allá me quedara
en el otro mundo.
— Bien pudiera el Amor —dijo Sancho— depositarlos en los de mi asno, que yo
se lo agradeciera. Pero dígame, señora, así el cielo la acomode con otro
más blando amante que mi amo: ¿qué es lo que vio en el otro mundo? ¿Qué hay
en el infierno? Porque quien muere desesperado, por fuerza ha de tener
aquel paradero.
— La verdad que os diga —respondió Altisidora—, yo no debí de morir del
todo, pues no entré en el infierno; que, si allá entrara, una por una no
pudiera salir dél, aunque quisiera. La verdad es que llegué a la puerta,
adonde estaban jugando hasta una docena de diablos a la pelota, todos en
calzas y en jubón, con valonas guarnecidas con puntas de randas flamencas,
y con unas vueltas de lo mismo, que les servían de puños, con cuatro dedos
de brazo de fuera, porque pareciesen las manos más largas, en las cuales
tenían unas palas de fuego; y lo que más me admiró fue que les servían, en
lugar de pelotas, libros, al parecer, llenos de viento y de borra, cosa
maravillosa y nueva; pero esto no me admiró tanto como el ver que, siendo
natural de los jugadores el alegrarse los gananciosos y entristecerse los
que pierden, allí en aquel juego todos gruñían, todos regañaban y todos se
maldecían.
— Eso no es maravilla —respondió Sancho—, porque los diablos, jueguen o no
jueguen, nunca pueden estar contentos, ganen o no ganen.
— Así debe de ser —respondió Altisidora—; mas hay otra cosa que también me
admira, quiero decir me admiró entonces, y fue que al primer voleo no
quedaba pelota en pie, ni de provecho para servir otra vez; y así,
menudeaban libros nuevos y viejos, que era una maravilla. A uno dellos,
nuevo, flamante y bien encuadernado, le dieron un papirotazo que le sacaron
las tripas y le esparcieron las hojas. Dijo un diablo a otro: ''Mirad qué
libro es ése''. Y el diablo le respondió: ''Ésta es la Segunda parte de la
historia de don Quijote de la Mancha, no compuesta por Cide Hamete, su
primer autor, sino por un aragonés, que él dice ser natural de
Tordesillas''. ''Quitádmele de ahí —respondió el otro diablo—, y metedle en
los abismos del infierno: no le vean más mis ojos''. ''¿Tan malo es?'',
respondió el otro. ''Tan malo —replicó el primero—, que si de propósito yo
mismo me pusiera a hacerle peor, no acertara''. Prosiguieron su juego,
peloteando otros libros, y yo, por haber oído nombrar a don Quijote, a
quien tanto adamo y quiero, procuré que se me quedase en la memoria esta
visión.
— Visión debió de ser, sin duda —dijo don Quijote—, porque no hay otro yo en
el mundo, y ya esa historia anda por acá de mano en mano, pero no para en
ninguna, porque todos la dan del pie. Yo no me he alterado en oír que ando
como cuerpo fantástico por las tinieblas del abismo, ni por la claridad de
la tierra, porque no soy aquel de quien esa historia trata. Si ella fuere
buena, fiel y verdadera, tendrá siglos de vida; pero si fuere mala, de su
parto a la sepultura no será muy largo el camino.
Iba Altisidora a proseguir en quejarse de don Quijote, cuando le dijo don
Quijote:
— Muchas veces os he dicho, señora, que a mí me pesa de que hayáis colocado
en mí vuestros pensamientos, pues de los míos antes pueden ser agradecidos
que remediados; yo nací para ser de Dulcinea del Toboso, y los hados, si
los hubiera, me dedicaron para ella; y pensar que otra alguna hermosura ha
de ocupar el lugar que en mi alma tiene es pensar lo imposible. Suficiente
desengaño es éste para que os retiréis en los límites de vuestra
honestidad, pues nadie se puede obligar a lo imposible.
Oyendo lo cual Altisidora, mostrando enojarse y alterarse, le dijo:
— ¡Vive el Señor, don bacallao, alma de almirez, cuesco de dátil, más terco
y duro que villano rogado cuando tiene la suya sobre el hito, que si
arremeto a vos, que os tengo de sacar los ojos! ¿Pensáis por ventura, don
vencido y don molido a palos, que yo me he muerto por vos? Todo lo que
habéis visto esta noche ha sido fingido; que no soy yo mujer que por
semejantes camellos había de dejar que me doliese un negro de la uña,
cuanto más morirme.
— Eso creo yo muy bien —dijo Sancho—, que esto del morirse los enamorados es
cosa de risa: bien lo pueden ellos decir, pero hacer, créalo Judas.
Estando en estas pláticas, entró el músico, cantor y poeta que había
cantado las dos ya referidas estancias, el cual, haciendo una gran
reverencia a don Quijote, dijo:
— Vuestra merced, señor caballero, me cuente y tenga en el número de sus
mayores servidores, porque ha muchos días que le soy muy aficionado, así
por su fama como por sus hazañas.
Don Quijote le respondió:
— Vuestra merced me diga quién es, porque mi cortesía responda a sus
merecimientos.
El mozo respondió que era el músico y panegírico de la noche antes.
— Por cierto —replicó don Quijote—, que vuestra merced tiene estremada voz,
pero lo que cantó no me parece que fue muy a propósito; porque, ¿qué tienen
que ver las estancias de Garcilaso con la muerte desta señora?
— No se maraville vuestra merced deso —respondió el músico—, que ya entre
los intonsos poetas de nuestra edad se usa que cada uno escriba como
quisiere, y hurte de quien quisiere, venga o no venga a pelo de su intento,
y ya no hay necedad que canten o escriban que no se atribuya a licencia
poética.
Responder quisiera don Quijote, pero estorbáronlo el duque y la duquesa,
que entraron a verle, entre los cuales pasaron una larga y dulce plática,
en la cual dijo Sancho tantos donaires y tantas malicias, que dejaron de
nuevo admirados a los duques, así con su simplicidad como con su agudeza.
Don Quijote les suplicó le diesen licencia para partirse aquel mismo día,
pues a los vencidos caballeros, como él, más les convenía habitar una
zahúrda que no reales palacios. Diéronsela de muy buena gana, y la duquesa
le preguntó si quedaba en su gracia Altisidora. Él le respondió:
— Señora mía, sepa Vuestra Señoría que todo el mal desta doncella nace de
ociosidad, cuyo remedio es la ocupación honesta y continua. Ella me ha
dicho aquí que se usan randas en el infierno; y, pues ella las debe de
saber hacer, no las deje de la mano, que, ocupada en menear los palillos,
no se menearán en su imaginación la imagen o imágines de lo que bien
quiere; y ésta es la verdad, éste mi parecer y éste es mi consejo.
— Y el mío —añadió Sancho—, pues no he visto en toda mi vida randera que por
amor se haya muerto; que las doncellas ocupadas más ponen sus pensamientos
en acabar sus tareas que en pensar en sus amores. Por mí lo digo, pues,
mientras estoy cavando, no me acuerdo de mi oíslo; digo, de mi Teresa
Panza, a quien quiero más que a las pestañas de mis ojos.
— Vos decís muy bien, Sancho —dijo la duquesa—, y yo haré que mi Altisidora
se ocupe de aquí adelante en hacer alguna labor blanca, que la sabe hacer
por estremo.
— No hay para qué, señora —respondió Altisidora—, usar dese remedio, pues la
consideración de las crueldades que conmigo ha usado este malandrín
mostrenco me le borrarán de la memoria sin otro artificio alguno. Y, con
licencia de vuestra grandeza, me quiero quitar de aquí, por no ver delante
de mis ojos ya no su triste figura, sino su fea y abominable catadura.
— Eso me parece —dijo el duque— a lo que suele decirse:
Porque aquel que dice injurias,
cerca está de perdonar.
Hizo Altisidora muestra de limpiarse las lágrimas con un pañuelo, y,
haciendo reverencia a sus señores, se salió del aposento.
— Mándote yo —dijo Sancho—, pobre doncella, mándote, digo, mala ventura,
pues las has habido con una alma de esparto y con un corazón de encina. ¡A
fee que si las hubieras conmigo, que otro gallo te cantara!
Acabóse la plática, vistióse don Quijote, comió con los duques, y partióse
aquella tarde.
Capítulo LXXI. De lo que a don Quijote le sucedió con su escudero Sancho
yendo a su aldea
Iba el vencido y asendereado don Quijote pensativo además por una parte,
y muy alegre por otra. Causaba su tristeza el vencimiento; y la alegría, el
considerar en la virtud de Sancho, como lo había mostrado en la resurreción
de Altisidora, aunque con algún escrúpulo se persuadía a que la enamorada
doncella fuese muerta de veras. No iba nada Sancho alegre, porque le
entristecía ver que Altisidora no le había cumplido la palabra de darle las
camisas; y, yendo y viniendo en esto, dijo a su amo:
— En verdad, señor, que soy el más desgraciado médico que se debe de hallar
en el mundo, en el cual hay físicos que, con matar al enfermo que curan,
quieren ser pagados de su trabajo, que no es otro sino firmar una cedulilla
de algunas medicinas, que no las hace él, sino el boticario, y cátalo
cantusado; y a mí, que la salud ajena me cuesta gotas de sangre, mamonas,
pellizcos, alfilerazos y azotes, no me dan un ardite. Pues yo les voto a
tal que si me traen a las manos otro algún enfermo, que, antes que le cure,
me han de untar las mías; que el abad de donde canta yanta, y no quiero
creer que me haya dado el cielo la virtud que tengo para que yo la
comunique con otros de bóbilis, bóbilis.
— Tú tienes razón, Sancho amigo —respondió don Quijote—, y halo hecho muy
mal Altisidora en no haberte dado las prometidas camisas; y, puesto que tu
virtud es gratis data, que no te ha costado estudio alguno, más que estudio
es recebir martirios en tu persona. De mí te sé decir que si quisieras paga
por los azotes del desencanto de Dulcinea, ya te la hubiera dado tal como
buena; pero no sé si vendrá bien con la cura la paga, y no querría que
impidiese el premio a la medicina. Con todo eso, me parece que no se
perderá nada en probarlo: mira, Sancho, el que quieres, y azótate luego, y
págate de contado y de tu propia mano, pues tienes dineros míos.
A cuyos ofrecimientos abrió Sancho los ojos y las orejas de un palmo, y dio
consentimiento en su corazón a azotarse de buena gana; y dijo a su amo:
— Agora bien, señor, yo quiero disponerme a dar gusto a vuestra merced en lo
que desea, con provecho mío; que el amor de mis hijos y de mi mujer me hace
que me muestre interesado. Dígame vuestra merced: ¿cuánto me dará por cada
azote que me diere?
— Si yo te hubiera de pagar, Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, conforme lo que
merece la grandeza y calidad deste remedio, el tesoro de Venecia, las minas
del Potosí fueran poco para pagarte; toma tú el tiento a lo que llevas mío,
y pon el precio a cada azote.
— Ellos —respondió Sancho— son tres mil y trecientos y tantos; de ellos me
he dado hasta cinco: quedan los demás; entren entre los tantos estos cinco,
y vengamos a los tres mil y trecientos, que a cuartillo cada uno, que no
llevaré menos si todo el mundo me lo mandase, montan tres mil y trecientos
cuartillos, que son los tres mil, mil y quinientos medios reales, que hacen
setecientos y cincuenta reales; y los trecientos hacen ciento y cincuenta
medios reales, que vienen a hacer setenta y cinco reales, que, juntándose a
los setecientos y cincuenta, son por todos ochocientos y veinte y cinco
reales. Éstos desfalcaré yo de los que tengo de vuestra merced, y entraré
en mi casa rico y contento, aunque bien azotado; porque no se toman
truchas..., y no digo más.
— ¡Oh Sancho bendito! ¡Oh Sancho amable —respondió don Quijote—, y cuán
obligados hemos de quedar Dulcinea y yo a servirte todos los días que el
cielo nos diere de vida! Si ella vuelve al ser perdido, que no es posible
sino que vuelva, su desdicha habrá sido dicha, y mi vencimiento, felicísimo
triunfo. Y mira, Sancho, cuándo quieres comenzar la diciplina, que porque
la abrevies te añado cien reales.
— ¿Cuándo? —replicó Sancho—. Esta noche, sin falta. Procure vuestra merced
que la tengamos en el campo, al cielo abierto, que yo me abriré mis carnes.
Llegó la noche, esperada de don Quijote con la mayor ansia del mundo,
pareciéndole que las ruedas del carro de Apolo se habían quebrado, y que el
día se alargaba más de lo acostumbrado, bien así como acontece a los
enamorados, que jamás ajustan la cuenta de sus deseos. Finalmente, se
entraron entre unos amenos árboles que poco desviados del camino estaban,
donde, dejando vacías la silla y albarda de Rocinante y el rucio, se
tendieron sobre la verde yerba y cenaron del repuesto de Sancho; el cual,
haciendo del cabestro y de la jáquima del rucio un poderoso y flexible
azote, se retiró hasta veinte pasos de su amo, entre unas hayas. Don
Quijote, que le vio ir con denuedo y con brío, le dijo:
— Mira, amigo, que no te hagas pedazos; da lugar que unos azotes aguarden a
otros; no quieras apresurarte tanto en la carrera, que en la mitad della te
falte el aliento; quiero decir que no te des tan recio que te falte la vida
antes de llegar al número deseado. Y, porque no pierdas por carta de más ni
de menos, yo estaré desde aparte contando por este mi rosario los azotes
que te dieres. Favorézcate el cielo conforme tu buena intención merece.
— Al buen pagador no le duelen prendas —respondió Sancho—: yo pienso darme
de manera que, sin matarme, me duela; que en esto debe de consistir la
sustancia deste milagro.
Desnudóse luego de medio cuerpo arriba, y, arrebatando el cordel, comenzó a
darse, y comenzó don Quijote a contar los azotes.
Hasta seis o ocho se habría dado Sancho, cuando le pareció ser pesada la
burla y muy barato el precio della, y, deteniéndose un poco, dijo a su amo
que se llamaba a engaño, porque merecía cada azote de aquéllos ser pagado a
medio real, no que a cuartillo.
— Prosigue, Sancho amigo, y no desmayes —le dijo don Quijote—, que yo doblo
la parada del precio.
— Dese modo —dijo Sancho—, ¡a la mano de Dios, y lluevan azotes!
Pero el socarrón dejó de dárselos en las espaldas, y daba en los árboles,
con unos suspiros de cuando en cuando, que parecía que con cada uno dellos
se le arrancaba el alma. Tierna la de don Quijote, temeroso de que no se le
acabase la vida, y no consiguiese su deseo por la imprudencia de Sancho, le
dijo:
— Por tu vida, amigo, que se quede en este punto este negocio, que me parece
muy áspera esta medicina, y será bien dar tiempo al tiempo; que no se ganó
Zamora en un hora. Más de mil azotes, si yo no he contado mal, te has dado:
bastan por agora; que el asno, hablando a lo grosero, sufre la carga, mas
no la sobrecarga.
— No, no, señor —respondió Sancho—, no se ha de decir por mí: "a dineros
pagados, brazos quebrados". Apártese vuestra merced otro poco y déjeme dar
otros mil azotes siquiera, que a dos levadas déstas habremos cumplido con
esta partida, y aún nos sobrará ropa.
— Pues tú te hallas con tan buena disposición —dijo don Quijote—, el cielo
te ayude, y pégate, que yo me aparto.
Volvió Sancho a su tarea con tanto denuedo, que ya había quitado las
cortezas a muchos árboles: tal era la riguridad con que se azotaba; y,
alzando una vez la voz, y dando un desaforado azote en una haya, dijo:
— ¡Aquí morirás, Sansón, y cuantos con él son!
Acudió don Quijote luego al son de la lastimada voz y del golpe del
riguroso azote, y, asiendo del torcido cabestro que le servía de corbacho a
Sancho, le dijo:
— No permita la suerte, Sancho amigo, que por el gusto mío pierdas tú la
vida, que ha de servir para sustentar a tu mujer y a tus hijos: espere
Dulcinea mejor coyuntura, que yo me contendré en los límites de la
esperanza propincua, y esperaré que cobres fuerzas nuevas, para que se
concluya este negocio a gusto de todos.
— Pues vuestra merced, señor mío, lo quiere así —respondió Sancho—, sea en
buena hora, y écheme su ferreruelo sobre estas espaldas, que estoy sudando
y no querría resfriarme; que los nuevos diciplinantes corren este peligro.
Hízolo así don Quijote, y, quedándose en pelota, abrigó a Sancho, el cual
se durmió hasta que le despertó el sol, y luego volvieron a proseguir su
camino, a quien dieron fin, por entonces, en un lugar que tres leguas de
allí estaba. Apeáronse en un mesón, que por tal le reconoció don Quijote, y
no por castillo de cava honda, torres, rastrillos y puente levadiza; que,
después que le vencieron, con más juicio en todas las cosas discurría, como
agora se dirá. Alojáronle en una sala baja, a quien servían de guadameciles
unas sargas viejas pintadas, como se usan en las aldeas. En una dellas
estaba pintada de malísima mano el robo de Elena, cuando el atrevido
huésped se la llevó a Menalao, y en otra estaba la historia de Dido y de
Eneas, ella sobre una alta torre, como que hacía señas con una media sábana
al fugitivo huésped, que por el mar, sobre una fragata o bergantín, se iba
huyendo.
Notó en las dos historias que Elena no iba de muy mala gana, porque se reía
a socapa y a lo socarrón; pero la hermosa Dido mostraba verter lágrimas del
tamaño de nueces por los ojos. Viendo lo cual don Quijote, dijo:
— Estas dos señoras fueron desdichadísimas, por no haber nacido en esta
edad, y yo sobre todos desdichado en no haber nacido en la suya: encontrara
a aquestos señores, ni fuera abrasada Troya, ni Cartago destruida, pues con
sólo que yo matara a Paris se escusaran tantas desgracias.
— Yo apostaré —dijo Sancho— que antes de mucho tiempo no ha de haber
bodegón, venta ni mesón, o tienda de barbero, donde no ande pintada la
historia de nuestras hazañas. Pero querría yo que la pintasen manos de otro
mejor pintor que el que ha pintado a éstas.
— Tienes razón, Sancho —dijo don Quijote—, porque este pintor es como
Orbaneja, un pintor que estaba en Úbeda; que, cuando le preguntaban qué
pintaba, respondía: ''Lo que saliere''; y si por ventura pintaba un gallo,
escribía debajo: "Éste es gallo", porque no pensasen que era zorra. Desta
manera me parece a mí, Sancho, que debe de ser el pintor o escritor, que
todo es uno, que sacó a luz la historia deste nuevo don Quijote que ha
salido: que pintó o escribió lo que saliere; o habrá sido como un poeta que
andaba los años pasados en la corte, llamado Mauleón, el cual respondía de
repente a cuanto le preguntaban; y, preguntándole uno que qué quería decir
Deum de Deo, respondió: ''Dé donde diere''. Pero, dejando esto aparte, dime
si piensas, Sancho, darte otra tanda esta noche, y si quieres que sea
debajo de techado, o al cielo abierto.
— Pardiez, señor —respondió Sancho—, que para lo que yo pienso darme, eso se
me da en casa que en el campo; pero, con todo eso, querría que fuese entre
árboles, que parece que me acompañan y me ayudan a llevar mi trabajo
maravillosamente.
— Pues no ha de ser así, Sancho amigo —respondió don Quijote—, sino que para
que tomes fuerzas, lo hemos de guardar para nuestra aldea, que, a lo más
tarde, llegaremos allá después de mañana.
Sancho respondió que hiciese su gusto, pero que él quisiera concluir con
brevedad aquel negocio a sangre caliente y cuando estaba picado el molino,
porque en la tardanza suele estar muchas veces el peligro; y a Dios rogando
y con el mazo dando, y que más valía un "toma" que dos "te daré", y el
pájaro en la mano que el buitre volando.
— No más refranes, Sancho, por un solo Dios —dijo don Quijote—, que parece
que te vuelves al sicut erat; habla a lo llano, a lo liso, a lo no
intricado, como muchas veces te he dicho, y verás como te vale un pan por
ciento.
— No sé qué mala ventura es esta mía —respondió Sancho—, que no sé decir
razón sin refrán, ni refrán que no me parezca razón; pero yo me enmendaré,
si pudiere.
Y, con esto, cesó por entonces su plática.
Capítulo LXXII. De cómo don Quijote y Sancho llegaron a su aldea
Todo aquel día, esperando la noche, estuvieron en aquel lugar y mesón don
Quijote y Sancho: el uno, para acabar en la campaña rasa la tanda de su
diciplina, y el otro, para ver el fin della, en el cual consistía el de su
deseo. Llegó en esto al mesón un caminante a caballo, con tres o cuatro
criados, uno de los cuales dijo al que el señor dellos parecía:
— Aquí puede vuestra merced, señor don Álvaro Tarfe, pasar hoy la siesta: la
posada parece limpia y fresca.
Oyendo esto don Quijote, le dijo a Sancho:
— Mira, Sancho: cuando yo hojeé aquel libro de la segunda parte de mi
historia, me parece que de pasada topé allí este nombre de don Álvaro
Tarfe.
— Bien podrá ser —respondió Sancho—. Dejémosle apear, que después se lo
preguntaremos.
El caballero se apeó, y, frontero del aposento de don Quijote, la huéspeda
le dio una sala baja, enjaezada con otras pintadas sargas, como las que
tenía la estancia de don Quijote. Púsose el recién venido caballero a lo de
verano, y, saliéndose al portal del mesón, que era espacioso y fresco, por
el cual se paseaba don Quijote, le preguntó:
— ¿Adónde bueno camina vuestra merced, señor gentilhombre?
Y don Quijote le respondió:
— A una aldea que está aquí cerca, de donde soy natural. Y vuestra merced,
¿dónde camina?
— Yo, señor —respondió el caballero—, voy a Granada, que es mi patria.
— ¡Y buena patria! —replicó don Quijote—. Pero, dígame vuestra merced, por
cortesía, su nombre, porque me parece que me ha de importar saberlo más de
lo que buenamente podré decir.
— Mi nombre es don Álvaro Tarfe —respondió el huésped.
A lo que replicó don Quijote:
— Sin duda alguna pienso que vuestra merced debe de ser aquel don Álvaro
Tarfe que anda impreso en la Segunda parte de la historia de don Quijote de
la Mancha, recién impresa y dada a la luz del mundo por un autor moderno.
— El mismo soy —respondió el caballero—, y el tal don Quijote, sujeto
principal de la tal historia, fue grandísimo amigo mío, y yo fui el que le
sacó de su tierra, o, a lo menos, le moví a que viniese a unas justas que
se hacían en Zaragoza, adonde yo iba; y, en verdad en verdad que le hice
muchas amistades, y que le quité de que no le palmease las espaldas el
verdugo, por ser demasiadamente atrevido.
— Y, dígame vuestra merced, señor don Álvaro, ¿parezco yo en algo a ese tal
don Quijote que vuestra merced dice?
— No, por cierto —respondió el huésped—: en ninguna manera.
— Y ese don Quijote —dijo el nuestro—, ¿traía consigo a un escudero llamado
Sancho Panza?
— Sí traía —respondió don Álvaro—; y, aunque tenía fama de muy gracioso,
nunca le oí decir gracia que la tuviese.
— Eso creo yo muy bien —dijo a esta sazón Sancho—, porque el decir gracias
no es para todos, y ese Sancho que vuestra merced dice, señor gentilhombre,
debe de ser algún grandísimo bellaco, frión y ladrón juntamente, que el
verdadero Sancho Panza soy yo, que tengo más gracias que llovidas; y si no,
haga vuestra merced la experiencia, y ándese tras de mí, por los menos un
año, y verá que se me caen a cada paso, y tales y tantas que, sin saber yo
las más veces lo que me digo, hago reír a cuantos me escuchan; y el
verdadero don Quijote de la Mancha, el famoso, el valiente y el discreto,
el enamorado, el desfacedor de agravios, el tutor de pupilos y huérfanos,
el amparo de las viudas, el matador de las doncellas, el que tiene por
única señora a la sin par Dulcinea del Toboso, es este señor que está
presente, que es mi amo; todo cualquier otro don Quijote y cualquier otro
Sancho Panza es burlería y cosa de sueño.
— ¡Por Dios que lo creo! —respondió don Álvaro—, porque más gracias habéis
dicho vos, amigo, en cuatro razones que habéis hablado, que el otro Sancho
Panza en cuantas yo le oí hablar, que fueron muchas. Más tenía de comilón
que de bien hablado, y más de tonto que de gracioso, y tengo por sin duda
que los encantadores que persiguen a don Quijote el bueno han querido
perseguirme a mí con don Quijote el malo. Pero no sé qué me diga; que osaré
yo jurar que le dejo metido en la casa del Nuncio, en Toledo, para que le
curen, y agora remanece aquí otro don Quijote, aunque bien diferente del
mío.
— Yo —dijo don Quijote— no sé si soy bueno, pero sé decir que no soy el
malo; para prueba de lo cual quiero que sepa vuesa merced, mi señor don
Álvaro Tarfe, que en todos los días de mi vida no he estado en Zaragoza;
antes, por haberme dicho que ese don Quijote fantástico se había hallado en
las justas desa ciudad, no quise yo entrar en ella, por sacar a las barbas
del mundo su mentira; y así, me pasé de claro a Barcelona, archivo de la
cortesía, albergue de los estranjeros, hospital de los pobres, patria de
los valientes, venganza de los ofendidos y correspondencia grata de firmes
amistades, y, en sitio y en belleza, única. Y, aunque los sucesos que en
ella me han sucedido no son de mucho gusto, sino de mucha pesadumbre, los
llevo sin ella, sólo por haberla visto. Finalmente, señor don Álvaro Tarfe,
yo soy don Quijote de la Mancha, el mismo que dice la fama, y no ese
desventurado que ha querido usurpar mi nombre y honrarse con mis
pensamientos. A vuestra merced suplico, por lo que debe a ser caballero,
sea servido de hacer una declaración ante el alcalde deste lugar, de que
vuestra merced no me ha visto en todos los días de su vida hasta agora, y
de que yo no soy el don Quijote impreso en la segunda parte, ni este Sancho
Panza mi escudero es aquél que vuestra merced conoció.
— Eso haré yo de muy buena gana —respondió don Álvaro—, puesto que cause
admiración ver dos don Quijotes y dos Sanchos a un mismo tiempo, tan
conformes en los nombres como diferentes en las acciones; y vuelvo a decir
y me afirmo que no he visto lo que he visto, ni ha pasado por mí lo que ha
pasado.
— Sin duda —dijo Sancho— que vuestra merced debe de estar encantado, como
mi señora Dulcinea del Toboso, y pluguiera al cielo que estuviera su
desencanto de vuestra merced en darme otros tres mil y tantos azotes como
me doy por ella, que yo me los diera sin interés alguno.
— No entiendo eso de azotes —dijo don Álvaro.
Y Sancho le respondió que era largo de contar, pero que él se lo contaría
si acaso iban un mesmo camino.
Llegóse en esto la hora de comer; comieron juntos don Quijote y don Álvaro.
Entró acaso el alcalde del pueblo en el mesón, con un escribano, ante el
cual alcalde pidió don Quijote, por una petición, de que a su derecho
convenía de que don Álvaro Tarfe, aquel caballero que allí estaba presente,
declarase ante su merced como no conocía a don Quijote de la Mancha, que
asimismo estaba allí presente, y que no era aquél que andaba impreso en una
historia intitulada: Segunda parte de don Quijote de la Mancha, compuesta
por un tal de Avellaneda, natural de Tordesillas. Finalmente, el alcalde
proveyó jurídicamente; la declaración se hizo con todas las fuerzas que en
tales casos debían hacerse, con lo que quedaron don Quijote y Sancho muy
alegres, como si les importara mucho semejante declaración y no mostrara
claro la diferencia de los dos don Quijotes y la de los dos Sanchos sus
obras y sus palabras. Muchas de cortesías y ofrecimientos pasaron entre don
Álvaro y don Quijote, en las cuales mostró el gran manchego su discreción,
de modo que desengañó a don Álvaro Tarfe del error en que estaba; el cual
se dio a entender que debía de estar encantado, pues tocaba con la mano dos
tan contrarios don Quijotes.
Llegó la tarde, partiéronse de aquel lugar, y a obra de media legua se
apartaban dos caminos diferentes, el uno que guiaba a la aldea de don
Quijote, y el otro el que había de llevar don Álvaro. En este poco espacio
le contó don Quijote la desgracia de su vencimiento y el encanto y el
remedio de Dulcinea, que todo puso en nueva admiración a don Álvaro, el
cual, abrazando a don Quijote y a Sancho, siguió su camino, y don Quijote
el suyo, que aquella noche la pasó entre otros árboles, por dar lugar a
Sancho de cumplir su penitencia, que la cumplió del mismo modo que la
pasada noche, a costa de las cortezas de las hayas, harto más que de sus
espaldas, que las guardó tanto, que no pudieran quitar los azotes una
mosca, aunque la tuviera encima.
No perdió el engañado don Quijote un solo golpe de la cuenta, y halló que
con los de la noche pasada era tres mil y veinte y nueve. Parece que había
madrugado el sol a ver el sacrificio, con cuya luz volvieron a proseguir su
camino, tratando entre los dos del engaño de don Álvaro y de cuán bien
acordado había sido tomar su declaración ante la justicia, y tan
auténticamente.
Aquel día y aquella noche caminaron sin sucederles cosa digna de contarse,
si no fue que en ella acabó Sancho su tarea, de que quedó don Quijote
contento sobremodo, y esperaba el día, por ver si en el camino topaba ya
desencantada a Dulcinea su señora; y, siguiendo su camino, no topaba mujer
ninguna que no iba a reconocer si era Dulcinea del Toboso, teniendo por
infalible no poder mentir las promesas de Merlín.
Con estos pensamientos y deseos subieron una cuesta arriba, desde la cual
descubrieron su aldea, la cual, vista de Sancho, se hincó de rodillas y
dijo:
— Abre los ojos, deseada patria, y mira que vuelve a ti Sancho Panza, tu
hijo, si no muy rico, muy bien azotado. Abre los brazos y recibe también tu
hijo don Quijote, que si viene vencido de los brazos ajenos, viene vencedor
de sí mismo; que, según él me ha dicho, es el mayor vencimiento que
desearse puede. Dineros llevo, porque si buenos azotes me daban, bien
caballero me iba.
— Déjate desas sandeces —dijo don Quijote—, y vamos con pie derecho a entrar
en nuestro lugar, donde daremos vado a nuestras imaginaciones, y la traza
que en la pastoral vida pensamos ejercitar.
Con esto, bajaron de la cuesta y se fueron a su pueblo.
Capítulo LXXIII. De los agüeros que tuvo don Quijote al entrar de su aldea,
con otros sucesos que adornan y acreditan esta grande historia
A la entrada del cual, según dice Cide Hamete, vio don Quijote que en las
eras del lugar estaban riñendo dos mochachos, y el uno dijo al otro:
— No te canses Periquillo, que no la has de ver en todos los días de tu
vida.
Oyólo don Quijote, y dijo a Sancho:
— ¿No adviertes, amigo, lo que aquel mochacho ha dicho: ''no la has de ver
en todos los días de tu vida''?
— Pues bien, ¿qué importa —respondió Sancho— que haya dicho eso el mochacho?
— ¿Qué? —replicó don Quijote—. ¿No vees tú que, aplicando aquella palabra a
mi intención, quiere significar que no tengo de ver más a Dulcinea?
Queríale responder Sancho, cuando se lo estorbó ver que por aquella campaña
venía huyendo una liebre, seguida de muchos galgos y cazadores, la cual,
temerosa, se vino a recoger y a agazapar debajo de los pies del rucio.
Cogióla Sancho a mano salva y presentósela a don Quijote, el cual estaba
diciendo:
— Malum signum! Malum signum! Liebre huye, galgos la siguen: ¡Dulcinea no
parece!
— Estraño es vuesa merced —dijo Sancho—. Presupongamos que esta liebre es
Dulcinea del Toboso y estos galgos que la persiguen son los malandrines
encantadores que la transformaron en labradora: ella huye, yo la cojo y la
pongo en poder de vuesa merced, que la tiene en sus brazos y la regala:
¿qué mala señal es ésta, ni qué mal agüero se puede tomar de aquí?
Los dos mochachos de la pendencia se llegaron a ver la liebre, y al uno
dellos preguntó Sancho que por qué reñían. Y fuele respondido por el que
había dicho ''no la verás más en toda tu vida'', que él había tomado al
otro mochacho una jaula de grillos, la cual no pensaba volvérsela en toda
su vida. Sacó Sancho cuatro cuartos de la faltriquera y dióselos al
mochacho por la jaula, y púsosela en las manos a don Quijote, diciendo:
— He aquí, señor, rompidos y desbaratados estos agüeros, que no tienen que
ver más con nuestros sucesos, según que yo imagino, aunque tonto, que con
las nubes de antaño. Y si no me acuerdo mal, he oído decir al cura de
nuestro pueblo que no es de personas cristianas ni discretas mirar en estas
niñerías; y aun vuesa merced mismo me lo dijo los días pasados, dándome a
entender que eran tontos todos aquellos cristianos que miraban en agüeros.
Y no es menester hacer hincapié en esto, sino pasemos adelante y entremos
en nuestra aldea.
Llegaron los cazadores, pidieron su liebre, y diósela don Quijote; pasaron
adelante, y, a la entrada del pueblo, toparon en un pradecillo rezando al
cura y al bachiller Carrasco. Y es de saber que Sancho Panza había echado
sobre el rucio y sobre el lío de las armas, para que sirviese de repostero,
la túnica de bocací, pintada de llamas de fuego que le vistieron en el
castillo del duque la noche que volvió en sí Altisidora. Acomodóle también
la coroza en la cabeza, que fue la más nueva transformación y adorno con
que se vio jamás jumento en el mundo.
Fueron luego conocidos los dos del cura y del bachiller, que se vinieron a
ellos con los brazos abiertos. Apeóse don Quijote y abrazólos
estrechamente; y los mochachos, que son linces no escusados, divisaron la
coroza del jumento y acudieron a verle, y decían unos a otros:
— Venid, mochachos, y veréis el asno de Sancho Panza más galán que Mingo, y
la bestia de don Quijote más flaca hoy que el primer día.
Finalmente, rodeados de mochachos y acompañados del cura y del bachiller,
entraron en el pueblo, y se fueron a casa de don Quijote, y hallaron a la
puerta della al ama y a su sobrina, a quien ya habían llegado las nuevas de
su venida. Ni más ni menos se las habían dado a Teresa Panza, mujer de
Sancho, la cual, desgreñada y medio desnuda, trayendo de la mano a
Sanchica, su hija, acudió a ver a su marido; y, viéndole no tan bien
adeliñado como ella se pensaba que había de estar un gobernador, le dijo:
— ¿Cómo venís así, marido mío, que me parece que venís a pie y despeado, y
más traéis semejanza de desgobernado que de gobernador?
— Calla, Teresa —respondió Sancho—, que muchas veces donde hay estacas no
hay tocinos, y vámonos a nuestra casa, que allá oirás maravillas. Dineros
traigo, que es lo que importa, ganados por mi industria y sin daño de
nadie.
— Traed vos dinero, mi buen marido —dijo Teresa—, y sean ganados por aquí o
por allí, que, comoquiera que los hayáis ganado, no habréis hecho usanza
nueva en el mundo.
Abrazó Sanchica a su padre, y preguntóle si traía algo, que le estaba
esperando como el agua de mayo; y, asiéndole de un lado del cinto, y su
mujer de la mano, tirando su hija al rucio, se fueron a su casa, dejando a
don Quijote en la suya, en poder de su sobrina y de su ama, y en compañía
del cura y del bachiller.
Don Quijote, sin guardar términos ni horas, en aquel mismo punto se apartó
a solas con el bachiller y el cura, y en breves razones les contó su
vencimiento, y la obligación en que había quedado de no salir de su aldea
en un año, la cual pensaba guardar al pie de la letra, sin traspasarla en
un átomo, bien así como caballero andante, obligado por la puntualidad y
orden de la andante caballería, y que tenía pensado de hacerse aquel año
pastor, y entretenerse en la soledad de los campos, donde a rienda suelta
podía dar vado a sus amorosos pensamientos, ejercitándose en el pastoral y
virtuoso ejercicio; y que les suplicaba, si no tenían mucho que hacer y no
estaban impedidos en negocios más importantes, quisiesen ser sus
compañeros; que él compraría ovejas y ganado suficiente que les diese
nombre de pastores; y que les hacía saber que lo más principal de aquel
negocio estaba hecho, porque les tenía puestos los nombres, que les
vendrían como de molde. Díjole el cura que los dijese. Respondió don
Quijote que él se había de llamar el pastor Quijotiz; y el bachiller, el
pastor Carrascón; y el cura, el pastor Curambro; y Sancho Panza, el pastor
Pancino.
Pasmáronse todos de ver la nueva locura de don Quijote; pero, porque no se
les fuese otra vez del pueblo a sus caballerías, esperando que en aquel año
podría ser curado, concedieron con su nueva intención, y aprobaron por
discreta su locura, ofreciéndosele por compañeros en su ejercicio.
— Y más —dijo Sansón Carrasco—, que, como ya todo el mundo sabe, yo soy
celebérrimo poeta y a cada paso compondré versos pastoriles, o cortesanos,
o como más me viniere a cuento, para que nos entretengamos por esos
andurriales donde habemos de andar; y lo que más es menester, señores míos,
es que cada uno escoja el nombre de la pastora que piensa celebrar en sus
versos, y que no dejemos árbol, por duro que sea, donde no la retule y
grabe su nombre, como es uso y costumbre de los enamorados pastores.
— Eso está de molde —respondió don Quijote—, puesto que yo estoy libre de
buscar nombre de pastora fingida, pues está ahí la sin par Dulcinea del
Toboso, gloria de estas riberas, adorno de estos prados, sustento de la
hermosura, nata de los donaires, y, finalmente, sujeto sobre quien puede
asentar bien toda alabanza, por hipérbole que sea.
— Así es verdad —dijo el cura—, pero nosotros buscaremos por ahí pastoras
mañeruelas, que si no nos cuadraren, nos esquinen.
A lo que añadió Sansón Carrasco:
— Y cuando faltaren, darémosles los nombres de las estampadas e impresas,
de quien está lleno el mundo: Fílidas, Amarilis, Dianas, Fléridas,
Galateas y Belisardas; que, pues las venden en las plazas, bien las podemos
comprar nosotros y tenerlas por nuestras. Si mi dama, o, por mejor decir,
mi pastora, por ventura se llamare Ana, la celebraré debajo del nombre de
Anarda; y si Francisca, la llamaré yo Francenia; y si Lucía, Lucinda, que
todo se sale allá; y Sancho Panza, si es que ha de entrar en esta cofadría,
podrá celebrar a su mujer Teresa Panza con nombre de Teresaina.
Rióse don Quijote de la aplicación del nombre, y el cura le alabó infinito
su honesta y honrada resolución, y se ofreció de nuevo a hacerle compañía
todo el tiempo que le vacase de atender a sus forzosas obligaciones. Con
esto, se despidieron dél, y le rogaron y aconsejaron tuviese cuenta con su
salud, con regalarse lo que fuese bueno.
Quiso la suerte que su sobrina y el ama oyeron la plática de los tres; y,
así como se fueron, se entraron entrambas con don Quijote, y la sobrina le
dijo:
— ¿Qué es esto, señor tío? ¿Ahora que pensábamos nosotras que vuestra merced
volvía a reducirse en su casa, y pasar en ella una vida quieta y honrada,
se quiere meter en nuevos laberintos, haciéndose
Pastorcillo, tú que vienes,
pastorcico, tú que vas?
Pues en verdad que está ya duro el alcacel para zampoñas.
A lo que añadió el ama:
Y ¿podrá vuestra merced pasar en el campo las siestas del verano, los
serenos del invierno, el aullido de los lobos? No, por cierto, que éste es
ejercicio y oficio de hombres robustos, curtidos y criados para tal
ministerio casi desde las fajas y mantillas. Aun, mal por mal, mejor es ser
caballero andante que pastor. Mire, señor, tome mi consejo, que no se le
doy sobre estar harta de pan y vino, sino en ayunas, y sobre cincuenta años
que tengo de edad: estése en su casa, atienda a su hacienda, confiese a
menudo, favorezca a los pobres, y sobre mi ánima si mal le fuere.
— Callad, hijas —les respondió don Quijote—, que yo sé bien lo que me
cumple. Llevadme al lecho, que me parece que no estoy muy bueno, y tened
por cierto que, ahora sea caballero andante o pastor por andar, no dejaré
siempre de acudir a lo que hubiéredes menester, como lo veréis por la obra.
Y las buenas hijas —que lo eran sin duda ama y sobrina— le llevaron a la
cama, donde le dieron de comer y regalaron lo posible.
Capítulo LXXIV. De cómo don Quijote cayó malo, y del testamento que hizo, y
su muerte
Como las cosas humanas no sean eternas, yendo siempre en declinación de sus
principios hasta llegar a su último fin, especialmente las vidas de los
hombres, y como la de don Quijote no tuviese privilegio del cielo para
detener el curso de la suya, llegó su fin y acabamiento cuando él menos lo
pensaba; porque, o ya fuese de la melancolía que le causaba el verse
vencido, o ya por la disposición del cielo, que así lo ordenaba, se le
arraigó una calentura que le tuvo seis días en la cama, en los cuales fue
visitado muchas veces del cura, del bachiller y del barbero, sus amigos,
sin quitársele de la cabecera Sancho Panza, su buen escudero.
Éstos, creyendo que la pesadumbre de verse vencido y de no ver cumplido su
deseo en la libertad y desencanto de Dulcinea le tenía de aquella suerte,
por todas las vías posibles procuraban alegrarle, diciéndole el bachiller
que se animase y levantase, para comenzar su pastoral ejercicio, para el
cual tenía ya compuesta una écloga, que mal año para cuantas Sanazaro había
compuesto, y que ya tenía comprados de su propio dinero dos famosos perros
para guardar el ganado: el uno llamado Barcino, y el otro Butrón, que se
los había vendido un ganadero del Quintanar. Pero no por esto dejaba don
Quijote sus tristezas.
Llamaron sus amigos al médico, tomóle el pulso, y no le contentó mucho, y
dijo que, por sí o por no, atendiese a la salud de su alma, porque la del
cuerpo corría peligro. Oyólo don Quijote con ánimo sosegado, pero no lo
oyeron así su ama, su sobrina y su escudero, los cuales comenzaron a llorar
tiernamente, como si ya le tuvieran muerto delante. Fue el parecer del
médico que melancolías y desabrimientos le acababan. Rogó don Quijote que
le dejasen solo, porque quería dormir un poco. Hiciéronlo así y durmió de
un tirón, como dicen, más de seis horas; tanto, que pensaron el ama y la
sobrina que se había de quedar en el sueño. Despertó al cabo del tiempo
dicho, y, dando una gran voz, dijo:
— ¡Bendito sea el poderoso Dios, que tanto bien me ha hecho! En fin, sus
misericordias no tienen límite, ni las abrevian ni impiden los pecados de
los hombres.
Estuvo atenta la sobrina a las razones del tío, y pareciéronle más
concertadas que él solía decirlas, a lo menos, en aquella enfermedad, y
preguntóle:
— ¿Qué es lo que vuestra merced dice, señor? ¿Tenemos algo de nuevo? ¿Qué
misericordias son éstas, o qué pecados de los hombres?
— Las misericordias —respondió don Quijote—, sobrina, son las que en este
instante ha usado Dios conmigo, a quien, como dije, no las impiden mis
pecados. Yo tengo juicio ya, libre y claro, sin las sombras caliginosas de
la ignorancia, que sobre él me pusieron mi amarga y continua leyenda de los
detestables libros de las caballerías. Ya conozco sus disparates y sus
embelecos, y no me pesa sino que este desengaño ha llegado tan tarde, que
no me deja tiempo para hacer alguna recompensa, leyendo otros que sean luz
del alma. Yo me siento, sobrina, a punto de muerte; querría hacerla de tal
modo, que diese a entender que no había sido mi vida tan mala que dejase
renombre de loco, que, puesto que lo he sido, no querría confirmar esta
verdad en mi muerte. Llámame, amiga, a mis buenos amigos: el cura, al
bachiller Sansón Carrasco y a maese Nicolás, el barbero, que quiero
confesarme y hacer mi testamento.
Pero de este trabajo se escusó la sobrina con la entrada de los tres.
Apenas los vio don Quijote, cuando dijo:
— Dadme albricias, buenos señores, de que ya yo no soy don Quijote de la
Mancha, sino Alonso Quijano, a quien mis costumbres me dieron renombre de
Bueno. Ya soy enemigo de Amadís de Gaula y de toda la infinita caterva de
su linaje, ya me son odiosas todas las historias profanas del andante
caballería, ya conozco mi necedad y el peligro en que me pusieron haberlas
leído, ya, por misericordia de Dios, escarmentando en cabeza propia, las
abomino.
Cuando esto le oyeron decir los tres, creyeron, sin duda, que alguna nueva
locura le había tomado. Y Sansón le dijo:
— ¿Ahora, señor don Quijote, que tenemos nueva que está desencantada la
señora Dulcinea, sale vuestra merced con eso? Y ¿agora que estamos tan a
pique de ser pastores, para pasar cantando la vida, como unos príncipes,
quiere vuesa merced hacerse ermitaño? Calle, por su vida, vuelva en sí, y
déjese de cuentos.
— Los de hasta aquí —replicó don Quijote—, que han sido verdaderos en mi
daño, los ha de volver mi muerte, con ayuda del cielo, en mi provecho. Yo,
señores, siento que me voy muriendo a toda priesa; déjense burlas aparte, y
traíganme un confesor que me confiese y un escribano que haga mi
testamento, que en tales trances como éste no se ha de burlar el hombre con
el alma; y así, suplico que, en tanto que el señor cura me confiesa, vayan
por el escribano.
Miráronse unos a otros, admirados de las razones de don Quijote, y, aunque
en duda, le quisieron creer; y una de las señales por donde conjeturaron se
moría fue el haber vuelto con tanta facilidad de loco a cuerdo, porque a
las ya dichas razones añadió otras muchas tan bien dichas, tan cristianas y
con tanto concierto, que del todo les vino a quitar la duda, y a creer que
estaba cuerdo.
Hizo salir la gente el cura, y quedóse solo con él, y confesóle.
El bachiller fue por el escribano, y de allí a poco volvió con él y con
Sancho Panza; el cual Sancho, que ya sabía por nuevas del bachiller en qué
estado estaba su señor, hallando a la ama y a la sobrina llorosas, comenzó
a hacer pucheros y a derramar lágrimas. Acabóse la confesión, y salió el
cura, diciendo:
— Verdaderamente se muere, y verdaderamente está cuerdo Alonso Quijano el
Bueno; bien podemos entrar para que haga su testamento.
Estas nuevas dieron un terrible empujón a los ojos preñados de ama, sobrina
y de Sancho Panza, su buen escudero, de tal manera, que los hizo reventar
las lágrimas de los ojos y mil profundos suspiros del pecho; porque,
verdaderamente, como alguna vez se ha dicho, en tanto que don Quijote fue
Alonso Quijano el Bueno, a secas, y en tanto que fue don Quijote de la
Mancha, fue siempre de apacible condición y de agradable trato, y por esto
no sólo era bien querido de los de su casa, sino de todos cuantos le
conocían.
Entró el escribano con los demás, y, después de haber hecho la cabeza del
testamento y ordenado su alma don Quijote, con todas aquellas
circunstancias cristianas que se requieren, llegando a las mandas, dijo:
— Ítem, es mi voluntad que de ciertos dineros que Sancho Panza, a quien en
mi locura hice mi escudero, tiene, que, porque ha habido entre él y mí
ciertas cuentas, y dares y tomares, quiero que no se le haga cargo dellos,
ni se le pida cuenta alguna, sino que si sobrare alguno, después de haberse
pagado de lo que le debo, el restante sea suyo, que será bien poco, y buen
provecho le haga; y, si como estando yo loco fui parte para darle el
gobierno de la ínsula, pudiera agora, estando cuerdo, darle el de un reino,
se le diera, porque la sencillez de su condición y fidelidad de su trato lo
merece.
Y, volviéndose a Sancho, le dijo:
— Perdóname, amigo, de la ocasión que te he dado de parecer loco como yo,
haciéndote caer en el error en que yo he caído, de que hubo y hay
caballeros andantes en el mundo.
— ¡Ay! —respondió Sancho, llorando—: no se muera vuestra merced, señor mío,
sino tome mi consejo y viva muchos años, porque la mayor locura que puede
hacer un hombre en esta vida es dejarse morir, sin más ni más, sin que
nadie le mate, ni otras manos le acaben que las de la melancolía. Mire no
sea perezoso, sino levántese desa cama, y vámonos al campo vestidos de
pastores, como tenemos concertado: quizá tras de alguna mata hallaremos a
la señora doña Dulcinea desencantada, que no haya más que ver. Si es que se
muere de pesar de verse vencido, écheme a mí la culpa, diciendo que por
haber yo cinchado mal a Rocinante le derribaron; cuanto más, que vuestra
merced habrá visto en sus libros de caballerías ser cosa ordinaria
derribarse unos caballeros a otros, y el que es vencido hoy ser vencedor
mañana.
— Así es —dijo Sansón—, y el buen Sancho Panza está muy en la verdad destos
casos.
— Señores —dijo don Quijote—, vámonos poco a poco, pues ya en los nidos de
antaño no hay pájaros hogaño: yo fui loco, y ya soy cuerdo; fui don Quijote
de la Mancha, y soy agora, como he dicho, Alonso Quijano el Bueno. Pueda
con vuestras mercedes mi arrepentimiento y mi verdad volverme a la
estimación que de mí se tenía, y prosiga adelante el señor escribano.
»Ítem, mando toda mi hacienda, a puerta cerrada, a Antonia Quijana, mi
sobrina, que está presente, habiendo sacado primero de lo más bien parado
della lo que fuere menester para cumplir las mandas que dejo hechas; y la
primera satisfación que se haga quiero que sea pagar el salario que debo
del tiempo que mi ama me ha servido, y más veinte ducados para un vestido.
Dejo por mis albaceas al señor cura y al señor bachiller Sansón Carrasco,
que están presentes.
»Ítem, es mi voluntad que si Antonia Quijana, mi sobrina, quisiere casarse,
se case con hombre de quien primero se haya hecho información que no sabe
qué cosas sean libros de caballerías; y, en caso que se averiguare que lo
sabe, y, con todo eso, mi sobrina quisiere casarse con él, y se casare,
pierda todo lo que le he mandado, lo cual puedan mis albaceas distribuir en
obras pías a su voluntad.
»Ítem, suplico a los dichos señores mis albaceas que si la buena suerte les
trujere a conocer al autor que dicen que compuso una historia que anda por
ahí con el título de Segunda parte de las hazañas de don Quijote de la
Mancha, de mi parte le pidan, cuan encarecidamente ser pueda, perdone la
ocasión que sin yo pensarlo le di de haber escrito tantos y tan grandes
disparates como en ella escribe, porque parto desta vida con escrúpulo de
haberle dado motivo para escribirlos.
Cerró con esto el testamento, y, tomándole un desmayo, se tendió de largo a
largo en la cama. Alborotáronse todos y acudieron a su remedio, y en tres
días que vivió después deste donde hizo el testamento, se desmayaba muy a
menudo. Andaba la casa alborotada; pero, con todo, comía la sobrina,
brindaba el ama, y se regocijaba Sancho Panza; que esto del heredar algo
borra o templa en el heredero la memoria de la pena que es razón que deje
el muerto.
En fin, llegó el último de don Quijote, después de recebidos todos los
sacramentos, y después de haber abominado con muchas y eficaces razones de
los libros de caballerías. Hallóse el escribano presente, y dijo que nunca
había leído en ningún libro de caballerías que algún caballero andante
hubiese muerto en su lecho tan sosegadamente y tan cristiano como don
Quijote; el cual, entre compasiones y lágrimas de los que allí se hallaron,
dio su espíritu: quiero decir que se murió.
Viendo lo cual el cura, pidió al escribano le diese por testimonio como
Alonso Quijano el Bueno, llamado comúnmente don Quijote de la Mancha, había
pasado desta presente vida y muerto naturalmente; y que el tal testimonio
pedía para quitar la ocasión de algún otro autor que Cide Hamete Benengeli
le resucitase falsamente, y hiciese inacabables historias de sus hazañas.
Este fin tuvo el Ingenioso Hidalgo de la Mancha, cuyo lugar no quiso poner
Cide Hamete puntualmente, por dejar que todas las villas y lugares de la
Mancha contendiesen entre sí por ahijársele y tenérsele por suyo, como
contendieron las siete ciudades de Grecia por Homero.
Déjanse de poner aquí los llantos de Sancho, sobrina y ama de don Quijote,
los nuevos epitafios de su sepultura, aunque Sansón Carrasco le puso éste:
Yace aquí el Hidalgo fuerte
que a tanto estremo llegó
de valiente, que se advierte
que la muerte no triunfó
de su vida con su muerte.
Tuvo a todo el mundo en poco;
fue el espantajo y el coco
del mundo, en tal coyuntura,
que acreditó su ventura
morir cuerdo y vivir loco.
Y el prudentísimo Cide Hamete dijo a su pluma:
— Aquí quedarás, colgada desta espetera y deste hilo de alambre, ni sé si
bien cortada o mal tajada péñola mía, adonde vivirás luengos siglos, si
presuntuosos y malandrines historiadores no te descuelgan para profanarte.
Pero, antes que a ti lleguen, les puedes advertir, y decirles en el mejor
modo que pudieres:
''¡Tate, tate, folloncicos!
De ninguno sea tocada;
porque esta impresa, buen rey,
para mí estaba guardada.
Para mí sola nació don Quijote, y yo para él; él supo obrar y yo escribir;
solos los dos somos para en uno, a despecho y pesar del escritor fingido y
tordesillesco que se atrevió, o se ha de atrever, a escribir con pluma de
avestruz grosera y mal deliñada las hazañas de mi valeroso caballero,
porque no es carga de sus hombros ni asunto de su resfriado ingenio; a
quien advertirás, si acaso llegas a conocerle, que deje reposar en la
sepultura los cansados y ya podridos huesos de don Quijote, y no le quiera
llevar, contra todos los fueros de la muerte, a Castilla la Vieja,
haciéndole salir de la fuesa donde real y verdaderamente yace tendido de
largo a largo, imposibilitado de hacer tercera jornada y salida nueva; que,
para hacer burla de tantas como hicieron tantos andantes caballeros, bastan
las dos que él hizo, tan a gusto y beneplácito de las gentes a cuya noticia
llegaron, así en éstos como en los estraños reinos''. Y con esto cumplirás
con tu cristiana profesión, aconsejando bien a quien mal te quiere, y yo
quedaré satisfecho y ufano de haber sido el primero que gozó el fruto de
sus escritos enteramente, como deseaba, pues no ha sido otro mi deseo que
poner en aborrecimiento de los hombres las fingidas y disparatadas
historias de los libros de caballerías, que, por las de mi verdadero don
Quijote, van ya tropezando, y han de caer del todo, sin duda alguna. Vale.

1.F.
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
